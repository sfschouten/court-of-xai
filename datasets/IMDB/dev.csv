i saw this film opening weekend in australia anticipating with an excellent cast of ledger edgerton bloom watts and rush that the definitive story of ned kelly would unfold before me unfortunately despite an outstanding performance by heath ledger in the lead role the plot was paper thin which doesn't inspire me to read our sunshine there were some other plus points the support acting from edgerton in particular assured direction from jordan confirming his talent on show in buffalo soldiers as well and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the australian bush much as the irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it but i can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an australian folk hero or was he in what i suspect is a concession to hollywood and selling the picture in the us oh well at least jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please universal br br guess i will just have to content myself with peter carey's excellent secret history of the kelly gang 4 10,0
it's such a shame that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football bend it like beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick the story line is touching and intelligent without being soppy the jokes were laugh out loud funny and the characters are well acted parminder nagra and keira knightley are brilliant as teenagers jess and jules putting in great performances both on and off the pitch anupam kher is wonderful as jess' worried father and jonathan rhys meyers who was so amazingly evil in 'ride with the devil ' comes across so well as the nice guy for once making full use of his gorgeous irish accent even if you don't like football go see this film if anything it'll make you smile,1
despite or perhaps in part because of the clever use of music to underscore the motivations and ideologies of each of the major characters stereotypes are in and verisimilitude and characterization are out in this not too subtle cinematic screed br br one gets the sense that john singleton was dabbling in post structuralist literary theory because it was the flavor of the day and higher learning was the tendentious result the low point of the movie is the peace rally in which the symbols of the 1960s free love movement are reappropriated for what much more closely resembles a take back the night rally with live stridently identity conscious musical acts in tow perhaps in his prim revisionism the director was trying to assert that identity politics is the new vietnam ooh how adrienne rich of himand remy's firing into the crowd is a nice touch if you're into rich's sort of political posturing br br i wish i could give this movie negative stars i can recommend it only to those interested in the 1990s as history a time when radical feminists brought the academic trinity of race class and gender to popular culture and declared man hating a viable and honorable political option where's camille paglia when you need her,0

this will not likely be voted best comedy of the year a few too many coincidences and plot holes however we are talking about a movie where a hit man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn't come as too much of a surprise brosnan is excellent in this role gone is the wooden james bond a role he was wasted in if he can maintain this kind of quality i hope he continues to make comedies greg kinnear is also excellent as brosnan's straight man i've read a few negative comments in here about hope davis but i thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within there are lots of good chuckles as brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where i nearly died laughing my father a consultant nearly lost it when julian describes himself as a facilitator much like grosse pointe blank another hit man comedy the humour can be very dark if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself,1
the director sidney j furie has created in hollow point a post modern absurdist masterpiece that challenges and constantly surprises the audience br br sidney j furie dares to ask the question of what happens to the tired conventional traditionalist paradigms of 'plot' and 'characterisation' when you remove the crutches of 'motivation' and 'reason' br br the result leads me to say that my opinion of him could not possibly get any higher br br one and a half stars br br p s nothing in this movie makes any sense the law enforcement agents are flat out unlikeable and the organised criminals are full on insane,0
how can anyone not love this movie i think it's a hilarious spoof of all the old gangster movies if you've never seen them watch this instead michael keaton has a ball in this role as anything goes one guy mangles the english language everytime he talks and griffin dunn plays a clueless d a but my favorite role has got to be joe piscopo he has all the best lines danny devito alan hale ray walston are in this star studded movie that lampoons gangsters a lot funnier than mafia did for the criminal underground,1
this film was basically velvet goldmine if the writers of party of five got a hold of it and made it a t v movie the film lacks what velvet goldmine had which was good acting writing and basically everything else the film had some of the worst writing i've seen since wild wild west it definitely needed to be interesting i know vh 1 has become a household name for their behind the music shows which are a lot better than all this which would have worked if it was a behind the music episode but didn't and feel flat on it's face,0
having just seen this on tmc it's fresh in my mind it's obvious that while the stooges are featured stars they don't really run the show first they're broken into 2 groups moe as shorty and larry and curly as a pair of vagrants so there's not a whole lot of full team work the love story that fuels the plot is uninteresting the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability there's another group of musical stooges that are unfunny unless you consider their attempts at being funny to be sadly buffoonish the music is tiresome they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses the dorky western wear is silly and there's an awful lot of the movie with no stooges on camera by the way this is obviously after curley's first stroke and his reduced energy level is clear vernon dent appears early on in an uncredited role i loved everything these guys ever did including all the non curley stuff but this little dogie is pretty lousy,0
gregory peck's acting was excellent as one would expect and the cinematography quite stunning even when playing directly into some melodramatic moment but the rest of the film was overacted and hard to watch for me anyway i tried to like it but had to fast forward through the last thirty minutes or so i feel i wasted a couple of good hours had it not been for gregory peck i wouldn't have lasted fifteen minutes 4 10,0
i'd have to admit that the draw of this movie is director eduardo sanchez who helmed the wildly popular and successful blair witch project besides this is an alien movie of sorts and sounded something like stephen king's dreamcatchers one of those movies that the critics hated but i enjoyed br br but nope unfortunately i felt that for the most parts altered is a waste of time so i shall keep this review short premises are always promising and altered's no different it tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger and as usual others will take you as a nutcase imagining stuff stories about alien abduction always have to deal with probes into the orifices so i shall not go into details but you get the drift it's damn uncomfortable and something you'd like to forget br br what if you're given a chance for revenge that is you manage to successfully hunt down and capture one alive what will you do for this group it's a gleeful payback time or so they thought and this is where the movie begins to develop into a snoozefest with bad uninspiring dialogue and even worse acting even if it's low budgeted there aren't many redeeming factors be it strength of storyline or any help from the cast in making their characters just a tad interesting it's the standard cardboard fare from a vanilla plain script coupled with some cheap scare tactics employed br br what's good though is the makeup much effort has been put into making some of the stuff which i shan't mention because that'll spoil just the few elements of what makes this movie tolerable other than that there are the usual cheap special effects blood and gory moments which is nothing you've never seen before br br watch this only as a last resort compared to the other monster movie in town feast this one is less fun and takes itself too seriously bogged down by an uninspiring direction you've been warned,0
ascension is actually a step up in terms of what the original movie was in story and in special effects jason scott lee is good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself if you remember him he was from the movie dragon the bruce lee story ' jason london is funny as luke the kid who helps the woman he loves from a far steal dracula's body from the slab diane neal is good as the woman who steals dracula's body in order to finds a cure for her dying boyfriend and stephen billington is great as dracula himself giving a better performance than gerard butler did the count in the original film roy scheider rounds out the rest of the cast in this movie and he does a decent job as the mentor of jason scott lee's character this is the second sequel in the trilogy and they are off to a good start it's up in the air whether the last film will close the series out on a good note,0
i watched about 30 minutes into this film before i finally got sick of getting bludgeoned over the head with this movie the soundtrack the so called 'plot' and each and every actor it's like they all think they're the main part of the movie and scream notice me over and over again the bad guy has his bad guy music going on and says sinister bad guy like things just in case you didn't quite catch on the good guy does brave and noble things just in case you didn't know he was the good guy and oh lord the plane scene my husband is missing oh my god it's impossible that he got up to stretch his legs or go to the toilet or anything he must be missing and yes i know his clothes were still there but honestly she woke up and started to panic before she even had time to look at the damn seat he'd been in br br as a religious girl i want to apologize to the world for wasting the film this was printed on br br and i want my 30 minutes back,0
writer director tony piccirillo adapted his own play about a straight man recently widowed learning in the last three weeks he is hiv positive he tracks down the one homosexual partner he ever had brings him to an apartment and ties him up forcing a blood test on the guy and promising bloody revenge if the results come back positive intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it plays out james marsden's captive is realistically cynical and snotty but the actor's own artificial mannerisms are disconcerting it's like watching a roadshow version of tom cruise scott speedman has to work harder with the more challenging role but his personality turn from shy guy to kidnapper on the edge isn't convincing and neither are the conversations the two men have marsden's gay party boy isn't apathetic of course he's momentarily sympathetic to speedman's plight but he doesn't react or behave the way any homosexual man would in this circumstance the movie isn't a cop out exactly but it is a fraud handicapped further by the bad editing the poorly conceived flashbacks the low budget production and the big finale which smacks of silly pretension and soapy melodrama 1 2 from,0
i have grown up reading modesty blaise both the comics and the books and she truly is a heroine to me although not being a great fan of quentin tarantino i anyway was interested to hear a few years back that he was considering making a film of her could he finally give modesty a nice big screen treatment she's worthy of i heard of 'my name is modesty' a few months ago and checked the stars it had been given here and wasn't too surprised to find out the score was not too high since beloved characters often have hard time melting the fans' heart if not done exactly right so i decided not to read any reviews and see the film instead and well i just finished watching it and i'm stunned and sad and yeah pretty furious too sad and furious of giving over an hour of my time seeing something so fabulous as modesty blaise character being turned into a film that has nothing to give to a viewer or a fan br br it seems that almost everything about this film is sub par and unprofessional although i must admit seeing some actors in other films earlier where they were fine so i can't blame them but the screenplay and the directing my god why even make this kind of crap with production values slightly bigger than your average tv film but done much worse i don't know the background of this film and actually i really don't want to know but i just can't help wondering that how on earth could tarantino with a straight face tell that he loves modesty and then put his name on this he just lost a huge amount of respect in my eyes the director was not the right man for this job and i can honestly thank him for ruining my night br br i give this film 3 stars and those stars go to the actors and the technical quality which could've been worse the other seven stars missing are what this film was not good at oh well hopefully at some point there will be a serious production of the modesty blaise movie that has some other goals than to steal money from the modesty fans although if people like tarantino are the ones making the decisions i'm not holding my breath,0
ok if you're looking for another bastketball diaries this is completely the wrong film br br i revolves around two brothers max the younger has a major cocaine addiction adam the eldest is a doctor this movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible it however does not it shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present most of the movie focus is on max and his parting ways eventually adam can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well perscription drugs br br this movie has almost no climax doesn't descend into what cocaine really does to you has boring and low budget scenes and the acting of the eldest brother adam is horrific br br i have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards it is not a heart wencher if you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs rent if not buy 'the basketball diaries' and notice the difference br br try to avoid this movie but if you think you will enjoy try and see for yourself,0
contains spoiler from both original and movie versions br br i am a huge fan of notre dame de paris musical i also read book this summer and i watched movie today in the beginning i was hopeful to watch a good film especially when i saw 6 3 imdb point first scenes were good but i actually waited for theaters scene directly from book but it was normal but when esmeralda kisses gringoire i felt something is wrong they don't even kiss in book even in musical br br and there were huge gap why esmeralda being judged by sorcerer in the book she teaches her goat how to respond numbers of clock or write word phoebus wait there were a phoebus weren't there in this movie he is some soldier junk nothing more the creators made quasimodo's love to show around and they even canceled frollo's love but notre dame was frollo his thoughts his struggles between love of god and love of human in movie we cant find anything like that all we have is some villain who is really bad and kills people whose clashes with his thoughts and not mentioning phoebus not mentioning love of frollo not mentioning jehan brother of frollo not mentioning mother of esmeralda maybe it is ok the storyline would have chopped much they even not mentioned the real story another ps frollo wasn't a opus dei or some cult member he actually in interest with alchemy he tries to make gold he was stuck in science and religion br br finally don't watch this movie it is some kind of directors edition to real masterpiece and if you have watched it before read the book god have mercy on you you must read to book immediately br br this movie is worse than hunchback of notre dame ii the animated movie spend your time with watching notre dame de paris musical enough said,0
as a youth pastor i heard good things about this movie then i watched it the acting wasn't the best that's forgivable it's the message that's not give jesus your life and everything will change you'll tackle better make amazing catches stop fumbling start making touchdown passes and even make the playoffs all because jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into all american athletes i laughed out loud when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals but wait that's not all you'll get a brand new truck a 6000 raise and you and your wife's struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy twice then you'll win the state championship because god helps a weakling kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than he's ever kicked before and into the wind no less all because god wanted him to make it then you'll win the state championship again the next year none of this good stuff would have happened if the team hadn't chosen to follow jesus will all their hearts br br here's what i took away from the movie god can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it and it's all about making our lives better easier and more enjoyable he chooses his favorite team and helps them win games which bible is this story based on i'll bet saint stephen wished he'd known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following jesus it would have saved them all a lot of trouble,0
i think i found the most misogynistic film of all time darklight br br the gist of the film lilith was adam's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of eden because she considered herself adam's equal and refused to submit to him see i took those words straight from the script then the film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do she ends the film under the control of the faith an all male group br br other than that the script was predictable and the fx were awful apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film there was nothing original about darklight,0
i just finished viewing this finely conceived and beautifully acted directed movie it was nip and tuck as to whether i was going to waste my time viewing a movie on the lifetime movie network because of the horribly distracting commercials reading the earlier comments persuaded me to give it a shot after all the worst that could happen would be that i might fall asleep during one of the boring yet lengthy bug spray ads so why did i watch it mainly because when imdb gives a movie a weighted average of 5 8 who's statistical average was 7 3 it must be a sure hit br br i was totally delighted to have taken the time to view this movie commercial pox and all helen hunt continues to amaze me with her ability to take on tough roles adapting her core persona to fit each role br br the portrait she painted in this film of the tough yet perceptively human police officer was beautifully executed when the scene calls for quick witted timely delivered verbal intercourse she can stand toe to toe with any actor yet she is adept at the delivery of volumes of emotional response without uttering a word relying only on facial expression and body language without the commercials which by design kill the continuity of any good film this would have been a real edge of the seat nail biter i gave it a 9 0,1
just bought the vhs on this film for two bucks did i waste my money hey i dig adam batman west and tina giligan's island louise but hello this third rate production is a rehash of a dozen other biker films crazed bunch of bikers psychos ride into a hick town beat up everybody and everything and then are defeated in the man by a dashing hero adam west looks the part as a hero but he's missing cape and his batman uniform sorry just isn't the same tina l looks really nervous and frightened the whole show but at least we know what happened to ginger once she was rescued from the island lol the bikers are a motley group and known of them ever acted again or at least shouldn't have hell riders is hell to watch,0

isabel allende's magical lyrical novel about three generations of an aristocratic south american family was vandalized the lumbering oaf of a movie that resulted largely due to a magnificent cast of anglo actors completely unable to carry off the evasive latin mellifluousness of allende's characters and a plodding scandinavian directorial hand was so uncomfortable in its own skin that i returned to the theater a second time to make certain i had not missed something vital that might change my opinion to my disappointment i had not missed a thing none among meryl streep jeremy irons glenn close and vanessa redgrave could wiggle free of the trap set for them by director bille august all of them looked perfectly stiff and resigned as if by putting forth as little effort as possible they expected to fade unnoticed into lovely period sets yes the film was art directed within an inch of its life curious that the production designer was permitted the gaffe of placing kfc products prominently in a scene that occurs circa 1970 years before kfc came into being back then it was known by its original name kentucky fried chicken even pardoning that what on earth is kentucky fried chicken doing in a military dictatorship in south america in 1970 american fast food chains did not hit south america until the early 1980s the house of the spirits should have been the motion picture event of 1993 because it was so club footed and slavishly faithful to its vague idea of what the novel represented miramax had to market it as an art film as a result it was neither event nor art and for that isabel allende should have pressed charges for rape,0
this beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons 1 perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android 2 it wasn't an android at all but a woman the beautiful jean marsh br br the popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins back to this episode if they'd done it properly in fact the modernization of sex bots are in the news as i speak br br robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made so they could have at least had her act like one her fleshiness would then have added a creepy element instead it becomes a nice little love story about two humans on faraway star br br the twilight zone always stretched the imagination and credulity normally no one cared but this episode seemed hamstrung by a calvinist morality eschewing what would have amounted to masturbation with a machine or downright carelessness,0
very smart sometimes shocking i just love it it shoved one more side of david's brilliant talent he impressed me greatly david is the best the movie captivates your attention for every second,1
the plot of the story and the performance of the lead actors are very much down to earth the romance between two teen age boys on the screen was done in good taste you can easily relate to their emotions if you are one but if you are not one you can appreciate the kind of love the film is trying to impart,1
well the previews looked funny and i usually don't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because well you never know here is a movie that doesn't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults i was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what s h t spells essentially what happens here is a total twisting of dr seuss's classic it adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money if that was a subplot then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and the cat plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie,0
i can't agree with any of the comments first time i saw the film on a uk tv channel it was presented as an indie film and if you take the film under this angle i think it's an all different matter i couldn't believe what i was seeing and got hooked instantly the plot may be as bad as a js's show ie there is no plot but the acting is wicked it's hilarious and it's all in all an incredible trash movie br br it says as much about america than a bully or a ken park without the drama perspective but it gives a glimpse on the us society and more precisely on what afternoon tv viewers in america and i believe there are plenty of them are interested in after all it's the neighbours we're talking about don't we br br 100 fun,1
i consider this film one of the worst in the nightmare series it was so boring that i couldn't remember a thing 20 minutes after the film was over it even tires me to write a review on it br br okay 4 was a joke and freddy was the joker 5 tried to return to the roots of the series it was darker and more atmospheric than nightmare 4 which is a good thing basically they tried to shoot a horror film instead of a comedy unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and scares because of that nightmare 5 the dream child is neither funny nor is it scary what we actually get is a boring film with the usual bad actors maybe with the exception of lisa wilcox br br the plot freddy killing lisa's friends by using the dreams of lisa's unborn child has a good base but it just isn't enough for 90 minutes of film sometimes the story gets very confusing maybe because there isn't any and you can't stop wondering what the filmmakers were aiming at the screenplay must have had more holes than swiss cheese and the film therefore was very cheesy itself let me say that i don't like cheese though even if i am from switzerland not even the special effects were as good as for example in part 4 br br don't bother to rent buy this film if not for completeness it's quite a mess br br my rating 4 10 get used to it 6 is also a messy one,0
this is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made for television drama my all time favourite actor robert culp skillfully plots a trajectory through uptight liberal fairmindedness and faith in the system kneejerk conservativism and fear of crime and homicidal psychosis the teens are a collection of pure sneering evil stereotypes and the eventual message of this film makes episodes of dragnet look evenhanded by comparison but what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie building the fear and paranoia by degrees as well as the feel of the whole california setting the cars are really great as well as i recall i give this film a 10 and i defy anyone to watch this film and not enjoy every minute remember just because it's made for television doesn't mean it isn't great art,1
one of my favorite films for a number of years was last action hero unfortunately arnold schwarznegger decided to spoil my fun by becoming a corrupt scumbag politician so now i can't bear any film he may had a hand in br br the adventures of jake speed actually toys with some themes similar to those in last hero so i was pleased to find it on dvd so i could watch these themes played out so well br br despite the plot within the plot involving white slavery during an african nation's civil war this is not an action movie the plot that the plot within a plot is within is actually about a question that the film has no intention to resolve is jake speed a real person that is helping the heroine save her sister from the white slave trader or is he actually a fictional character which means that the heroine has somehow entered the universe that really only exists in a series of pulp novels i suggest that this is not all that clearly defined in the film and that wayne crawford and andrew lane are perfectly aware of this the film thus becomes a presentation of what audiences may want from such a fictional adventure story universe that's actually a rich theme the potential heaviness of which is lightened by the film's amiable and campy sense of humor br br there are weaknesses to the film primarily it's cinematography which makes the film look like a tv show and the pacing does sag on occasion br br but i really like these characters and i enjoy the adventure they live however silly and i just find fascinating the idea that this adventure is actually taking place in a novel br br holds up under multiple viewings m good show,1
what is very french about this film is the time taken to establish the two leading characters this might require a bit of patience especially since neither is attractive in the typical hollywood definition of such however once the heist kicks in the film rushes forward quickly perhaps at times too quickly but it is a real rollercoaster ride and if you don't look too closely it is all quite believable the kind of film that you know hollywood would have botched up,1
johnny dangerously is a sort of hit and miss comedy that has it's laughs and huh but i suggest to give it a chance i think it is greatly over looked not too many people give this movie a chance it does work just think of it as a little parody of goodfellas michael keaton is very funny in his role and he does it well johnny dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life he just works his way up from the big bosses to a beautiful wife and of course like a lot of the mob movies someone wants him dead 90 of the jokes get a laugh like i said give it a chance just take your favortie gangster movies and mix a comedy in you have johnny dangerously br br 7 10,1
no this hilariously horrible 70's made for tv horror clinker isn't about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake still this exceptionally awful yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute unremitting silliness and atrociousness that's quite tasty in a so execrable it's downright awesome sort of way richard crenna looking haggard and possibly inebriated and yvette mimieux who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in jackson county jail sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint dull sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute german shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit pretty soon mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids kim richards and ike eisenmann the psychic alien moppets from the disney witch mountain pictures are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty ugly canine entity in the den boy now doesn't that sound really scary and disturbing well scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain't but it sure is funny thanks to curtis night tide harrington's hopelessly weak direction cartoonish not so special effects an almost painfully risible'n'ridiculous plot and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story besides the leads both martine beswicke and r g armstrong briefly pop up as members of a satanic cult and victor jory has a nice cameo as a helpful native american shaman favorite scene the malicious mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on crenna practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade while stuck up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock devout tv trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to alpo,1

with a simplistic story and an engaging heroine this was the horror movie that started it all john carpenter brings to life a nail biting nightmare on halloween night when laurie strode jamie lee curtis in her debut career defining role and her mischievous friends plan a night of sneaky fun only to cross paths with a relentless psychopath from hell br br michael myers has escaped from a nearby insane aslyum having slaughtered his sister fifteen years earlier he is now back in haddonfield the sleepy illinois town where his murder took place once he sets his eyes on laurie after she drops off a package to the abandoned house where he lived he begins to stalk and terrorize her turning her night of fun into terror as he picks off anyone in his path to get to her br br beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this moody horror flick scary with the long gloomy shots it constantly feels as if you're being stalked by the maniacal serial killer himself myers is hidden well until fully revealed at the exciting conclusion br br although halloween is certainly outdated it is by no means less chilling the idea alone is goose bump inducing and this little shocker is one of the most famous and memorable horror movies ever made to this day it spawned seven sequels and eventually rob zombie's equally scary remake and it set a new standard for horror that still exists today,1
but i regret having seen it since the ratings on imdb are relatively high and they must also have been relatively high on netflix i guess i put it in my queue because it is advertised as a gentle comedy from the uk a category that has produced many films i liked immensely saving grace on the other hand falls into the category of laugh less comedies usually populated by hollywood movies produced and directed by the talentless brenda blethyn is a capable actress and i have liked her in other movies the concept a gardener growing marijuana to overcome the penury she finds herself confronting after her husband's death does not offend me notwithstanding the strenuous efforts on the part of the cast to produce humor the film falls flat on its face falling flat on its arse might have been funnier as far as i and my wife were concerned be forewarned oh gentle reader not all offbeat british comedies succeed this one is a dud,0
with various bogdanoviches and gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew they all laughed is very much a family affair if you add the fact that b gazzara and miss a hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration if this all smacks of smug in joke self gratification you will be pleased to hear that mr bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent i love n y paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late miss hepburn make no mistake this is her picture mr gazzara concedes it to her most self effacingly in all their scenes together the plot a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs is of minimal importance it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie mr bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors from targets onwards there is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment miss hepburn in particular benefits from this love extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors principally who the hell's in it recently remaindered in uk bookstores the soundtrack to they all laughed varies from louis armstrong's 1947 new york town hall concert to sinatra to country to latin as eclectic as the city it portrays mr b s golden boy image was sure to tarnish for such is the nature of the movie business but it is equally sure one day to be restored and when that day comes they all laughed will be recognised for the fine work that it is,1
in the tradition of 'carrie' and 'heathers' try a shameless ripoff of not only those two films but 'the evil dead' and 'the shining' as well ' that said they really don't make bad horror movies like this anymore and that's a shame 'cause it's a gas br br rainbow harvest is the winona substitute here and although she barely does more than mumble her lines and occasionally scream you're ugly ' into her haunted mirror she's goth way before it's fashionable so you have to respect her and she's quite creative about it too accessorizing with black leather scarves and a kind of black spray painted hawaiian punch guy hat eat your heart out cher br br karen black overacts a bit but she's not totally without dignity and you can't help but sympathize with her unless you're a certain friend of mine who asked who is that horse lips from 'm a s h' ' the first time she came onscreen br br there are decent supporting performances by kristin dattilo as the square chick who befriends rainbow ricky paull goldin in his trademarked wisecracking hunk role and william larry darryl and darryl' sanderson as some kind of pet undertaker or something but it's sad to see the once smokin' yvonne decarlo reduced to playing what can only be thought of as the charlotte rae part br br the eighties were the heyday for hilarious mindbogglingly dumb horror movies like this and mirror mirror' was one of the last of its kind definitely worth a look,0
ever since i remember i have loved airplanes and flying i am now in college with a private pilot's license and looking to become a commercial i could never remember why i was so obsessed with the subject until i came across my old tail spin tapes in my basement at home and it hit me this was it my parents bought every single tape they had and this was the only show i would watch as a kid i had the theme memorized as i grew up and i can still re cite it today it is absolutely amazing and i plan on buying the dvd's soon it really is great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless i cannot get enough of this show,1
what exactly was going on during world war 11 in new zealand when american forces were there br br this awful story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to view can you imagine casting joan fontaine as the older sister to sandra dee fontaine looked more like her mother even funnier was that fontaine becomes pregnant in the film br br piper laurie and paul newman who showed such great on screen chemistry 4 years later in the hustler have no scenes together in this film laurie plays another sister who goes off to wellington to tramp around there despite the fact that she is married woe to her when her husband comes back from the war br br jean simmons is widowed and finds romance with a much subdued paul newman there is even romance for the young miss dee here br br the picture has little to no meaning are they trying to say that all is fair in love and war if they are they did a poor job in selling this br br the conflict of interest with newman and simmons is quickly disposed of that is what should have been quickly done to this terribly disappointing film of 1957,0
the cure uses voice over to create an intense mood although the vo accounts for all of the film's lines it amazingly does not take away from the visual story the use of multiple film stocks add a lot of texture to the story the choice of combining b w and color worked nicely to enhance the leaps in time the ending will make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result i was especially enjoyed the thrill of the film's suspense the close ups for the love scene are also lovely and reflect a tasteful eye the piece is quite short but accomplishes a lot the tight editing really helps to show off what a short film can do worth watching more than once,1
seeing as keifer sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of tv it was a foregone conclusion i was gonna go to the movies and spend 15 on this i also think this applies to eva longoria fans br br the movie revolves around a leak that a secret service agent is planning to assassinate the president as the investigation unfolds it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated pete michael douglas pleading innocence pete goes on the fun fugitive style to search for the truth br br it's solid but certainly not spectacular a decent cast a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty but you could certainly do far worse,1
this movie is the best horror movie bar none i love how stanley just dumps the women into the lake i have been a fan of judd nelson's work for many years and he blew me away its a blend of horror and drama and romance not so much comedy his evil yet charming look captured me right then and there that look in his eyes i will never forget there's something about him i cant describe,1
national lampoon goes to the movies is the worst movie ever made surpassing even the witless plan 9 from outer space at least that movie was just inept the lampoon film on the other hand is both inept and mean once upon a time movies used to respect their audiences' intelligence this one however holds a fetid rotting carcass up to our faces and then tries to rub our noses in it br br another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are the nude scenes and i agree misses ganzel and dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh and very nice flesh it is but the directors seem not to realize that even t a needs a good story to surround it there's none of that here br br perversely the film makers save the worst for last the third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio in this vignette robby benson plays an eager beaver young police officer reporting for duty on his first day on the job he is paired with a weary cynical oldtimer played by richard widmark for just a moment we are given hope that this film will end triumphantly surely we think the youngster's spunky attitude will rub off on the cynic and change him for the better br br forlorn hope instead the cynic wins the day and the youngster's spark is doused forever national lampoon goes to the movies and heads right for the toilet asking us to follow it down the drain nominally this is a comedy but where's the humor,0
this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection br br the animation is well done but i feel like it is too presentational i would have preferred more images from behind more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to me br br but for a hollywood style film it works ok but it is very derivative of aardman films and this is bothering to me perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voice over br br i think the voice over is too glib,0
this movie has been made by one of the most absurd humorists in canada yves p pelletier i was shocked for a second that he made a romantic comedy but knowing he was a heavy cinephile was seen in every local festival and in the local cinematheque i had a positive feeling about this movie br br hell i was right right off the bat the scenario written by pelletier himself is a bit twisted and hard to follow but in pelletier's fashion it's a one of a kind 90 minutes jack in the box br br loosely inspired and mostly transformed allusion to dangerous liaisons by laclos les aimants consists of a twisted game of writing notes on the fridge throughout the movie you'll get the occasion to find out who's who and who's writing to who on that goddam fridge which pops up in an interesting love affair br br great storyline great photography great quotations of other movies should we ask more for a first movie,1
read on and take note you could save 88 minutes of your life was that all br br unremittingly bleak this film sets out to produce i'm guessing a modern small town american christmas fable in the capra style if fails completely and absolutely fails i've been trying to think of one good thing about it and can't let me mention some of the highlights br br people don't die they get to spend eternity as immigrant workers in santa's factory angels are actually ex cowboys who sit in trees santa can bring people back from the dead if you send him a nice letter br br and the plot i won't spoil it for you but there has to be some light in films if only to contrast with the darkness but there isn't any even the photography is bleak snow shown at the end of a freeze everywhere looking cold damp and miserable br br as you might guess the film has a happy schmaltzy ending what a relief,0
i happen to have bought one of those legacy of horror 50 movie pack collections and would you believe i'm still looking through them to find a good horror movie in it sometimes you find an enjoyable yet campy one like the devil's messenger or the devil bat or one of the great alfred hitchcock's films some aren't horror however and are only on there because hitchcock directed some horrors and suspense but other times it seems that they put movies like the island monster and this on because they can't accept the fact they would easily be forgotten and should be for that matter br br so we open up to sort of a westing game idea the rich yet cruel and abusive father played by carradine the one standing feature of this has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who he still hates carradine gives a good enough performance as always but he's left mainly in a voice recording and flashback sequences leaving us to sit through the mediocre terrible performances the rest of the cast either overacts or underacts in scenes given this was an independent film of the 70's the lighting and effects are pretty limited it's hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer can't see what's happening that well in some scenes some actors like the servants igor and elga give an effort at least and i'm ashamed to admit kind of left me chuckling at the end mainly for the sheer stupidity but still with some very minor happiness that they pulled some version of a twist to an otherwise pretty obvious who done it but not enough to enhance the quality of the film you aren't meant to like the characters as they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many unwatchable the death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there it proves that you would probably enjoy the 20 movie pack chilling containing films like house on a haunted hill little shop of horror's with jack nicholson and night of the living dead over it this is best avoided,0
i was really looking forward to seeing this film but after watching it i was really disappointed the best bit was when stephen king was in it rober john berk cannot act to save his life and neither can any of the others a few of the performances even made me laugh out loud the film was was not as i imagined it after reading the book which was awesome i imagined it darker and a lot scarier if i was stephen i would be really mad br br i don't know why they changed the ending i thought the ending of the book was very good if you just found out the pie killed your daughter you wouldn't feed it to anyone else would you br br book was so much better,0
i never had an inkling while watching the movie that it was meant for the idiot box i always thought that this was some very good successful movie of the late 90's but after i saw on the internet that this was meant for the tv i was shocked because for a television film it is absolutely fantastic br br the thing that mostly concerned me was the length i felt that the one on one battle scene should've been removed as it was completely unnecessary also it began to drag towards the end as it seemed as if the adventure was never going to end br br on the plus side there is a strong very interesting and captivating plot with magnificent performances by everyone i just felt that patrik frayze looked a bit haggard i also felt that gogool who looked dementing turned a bit stupid at some scenes br br i was delighted by the beautiful landscapes of africa also the first half of the movie would have made me give this movie a 9 still its a great film for the television 8 out of 10,1
in order to hold the public's attention for three hours we were treated not so much to a family's romp through four generations and 120 years of hungarian history as to sexual liaisons with a sister a sister in law and other adulteries oh yes there was also a totally gratuitous rape having said all this the first story of the relationship among the children of the patriarch was fresh and sensual thanks to jennifer ehle,0
the tenant is roman polanski's greatest film imo and i love chinatown but this one is so much more original and unconventional and downright creepy it's also a great black comedy some people i have shown this film to have been very disturbed by it afterwards so be forewarned it does affect some people that way polanski does a great job acting the lead role in the tenant as well as directing it,1
national lampoon was once a funny magazine whether you liked the stoner hippie days of the late sixties or the smug and sassy coke head days of the seventies when the comedy was fortified with plenty of naked babes depends very much on your date of birth but everyone agrees that by the early eighties middle age had killed off whichever remaining sparks of anarchic humour that the drugs hadn't and offerings like this film and the increasingly terrible spin off records shot further holes in the hull outside of a nicely illustrated title sequence there's absolutely nothing to recommend this singularly depressing stinkbug if you make it through the baffling opening segment 'growing myself' hoping things will get better tough luck they don't whoever thought the idea of a woman being brutally raped with a stick of butter was comedy gold deserved to have his head handed back to him on a platter of dog mess if there's ever a global shortage of guitar picks the negatives of this rambling incoherent ragbag of crummy ideas and dire performances may well serve some purpose,0
a few years ago i added a comment to the imdb on the real mccoys tv series i said then and repeat now it was a charming funny and entertaining show well acted with wonderful characterizations br br i recently saw on dvd four old episodes plus the reunion of 2000 with richard crenna kathy nolan and tony martinez as another writer here mentioned it is curious that lydia reed hassie and michael winkelman little luke weren't refered to but perhaps they can be tracked down via sag or aftra br br the reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show one piece of inside information we did not get was whether or not kathy nolan regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute which left luke a widow in it's last year which wasn't very good nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy called broadside about women nurses in the pacific in ww ii get it broadside no not funny br br unlike the sleazy salacious and violent trash on tv now that is so undermining our values the real mccoys entertained with decent values and fine human beings and i thank all involved including the creator irving pinkus for having brought it to my family we never missed it,1
unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 except for the r rating there are very few things to like here one or two lines from kenan thompson david koechner we really should see him more and sam jackson are humorous and julianna margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings but sadly that's it poor plot poor acting worse writing and delivery the special effects are dismal as much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible if we consider the action portions well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan this movie only contains the latter kind this leaves little left i'm so glad i did not pay for this br br despite any hype i can read and think so as i sat down to watch i did not expect anything good i had no expectations but was somewhat worried going in yet like a train wreck one cannot merely look away and even with no expectations i was let down bad not even 'so bad it's good' material i'm very tolerant of bad movies but this makes six string samurai which i liked oscar worthy br br no this piece of over cgi'd rubbish is in the same company as battlefield earth little man and gigli how this is currently rated a 7 2 completely mystifies me brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that i can think of as answers br br i could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight i witnessed a train wreck i need to go wash my eyes 1 of 10,0
yeah it's a chick flick and it moves kinda slow but it's actually pretty good and i consider myself a manly man you gotta love judy davis no matter what she's in and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural convincing performance br br the scenery of the small coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the major theme of the movie the unknown at least unknown to me actors and actresses lend a realism to the movie that draws you in and keeps your attention overall i give it an 8 10 go see it,1
red rock west is a perfect example of how good a film can be with practically no budget all you need is a smart script good actors and loads of atmosphere rrw delivers all these and more br br nic cage plays an ex marine injured in lebanon who is down to his last 5 dollars after being refused a job on an oilfield because of his bad knee he roles into red rock and is mistaken by bartender wayne jt walsh not quite as his most menacing but still evil for a hit man from texas br br he pays him to kill his wife and make it look like burglary only when he gets there just to check her out she offers him double to kill wayne cage just wants to get the hell out of town with his free money and leave the sparring lovers be but a series of mishaps and setbacks results in him yo yoing in and out of red rock back and forth eventually this leads to a run in with lyle from dallas a cheeky and somehow sympathetic dennis hopper the real hit man from texas who offers to help without knowing he's making the plot more complicated br br rrw never had a big release thus most of it's audience discovered it on video or on cable tv showings viewing it in such a way might make it seem like a tv movie but it's bigger than that the slick slowly timed direction moody score and howling desert wind would have all made for a great movie in theatres but the best you can do these days is watch the dvd on a big hdtv br br the only weak point of the movie i can think of is lara flynn boyle's boring femme fatale with the nasty dyke ish hairdo i certainly wouldn't fall for her but if you assume that nic cage's character is in to militant lesbians then you'll accept it nonetheless,1
i am not a huge fan of camp kitsch and the so bad it's good type of viewing however i really like this film for its fun factor and believe it or not it's innovation br br the whole thing has a ring of john waters and is boundlessly enthusiastic but with some superb actors and considered direction making the most of the slapstick and styalised movements billy zane moves with incredible expression see the scene on the bus for a text book lesson in how to use movement and is framed by some unexpected stars br br you may not like this film you may not enjoy it but if you get the chance to watch it then spare the time because chances are you will end the film with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humour of some big stars highly reccomended,1
i wasted my time and gave this show a chance this has to be one of the worst new shows if they gave an award to shows that suck this one should sweep the category the acting is poor and the story line is contrived now dinosaurs was a bit strange but at least it was entertaining that show lasted three seasons and was finally scraped this new show based on an insurance companies commercials is not funny and really has nothing going for it possibly the original commercials and the amount of times they were and still are repeated is what is wrong with this show it just came to tv and already we are tired of seeing the caveman characters,0
after reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews i decided that i would add my ten cents worth to say i thought the film was excellent not only in the visual beauty the writing music score acting and directing but in putting across the story of joseph smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in god the way he felt and knew to be his path i am very pleased indeed to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man i recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself no matter what religious path he or she may be walking this only instills one with more determination to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the savior taught us to do,1
maaan where do i start with this god awful movie bad bad bad story telling i do not know what the director was thinking when he made this movie namaste london was quite an enjoyable movie to be honest even the soundtrack was good but in this one oh my good for a movie which is supposed to be a musical one the songs are soooo bad ar rahman should have been the music director br br given two great actors a much better job should have been done by the director even though the first half sucks the last 30 mins of the movie are ok performances from salman and ajay save the movie from being a total disaster br br watch it if you have nothing better to do the last good movie from bollywood i watched and i do watch a load of them is dev d and wake up sid,0
the lion king is without a doubt my favorite disney movie of all time so i figured maybe i should give the sequels a chance and i did lion king 1 1 2 was pretty good and had it's good laughs and fun with timon and pumba only problem i feel sometimes no explanations are needed because they can create plot holes and just the feeling of wanting your own explanation well i would highly recommend this movie for lion king fans or just a night with the family it's a fun flick with the same laughs and lovable characters as the first so hopefully i'll get the same with the third installment to the lion king series sit back and just think hakuna matata it means no worries br br 8 10,1
well there you have it another disillusion on my account two actually first of all even though i like to think of myself that i know a little something about 70's euro exploitation and its most prolific contributors i never heard about joseph w sarno before here's a guy who made over seventy rancid and cult laden exploitation movies and i haven't seen a single one how why what happened here secondly and even worse just when you think to have found a new source for obscure cult movies that director's most famous and supposed masterpiece turns out to be an irredeemably dull and irritating film admittedly lesbian vampire movies form a pretty insignificant sub genre as a whole but some of them bath in ominous atmosphere and curious sensuality like josé larraz' vampyres or harry kümmel's daughters of darkness joseph sarno's film has nothing to offer except copious amounts of gratuitous nudity and even that becomes boring rather quickly the events take place in a secluded old castle hidden deep in the german mountains where five centuries ago lived a malicious and bloodthirsty literally baroness her loyal disciples still throw naked dance parties in the castle's catacombs which are lit by penis shaped candlesauch and hope to resurrect the baroness any time soon now suddenly don't even ask how the castle is full of young and sexy female guests so even more erotic rites ensue sounds delicious and entertaining enough but the devil's plaything contains a massive number of sequences where literally nothing happens and where the cast members' ignorant facial expressions are simply unendurable sarno isn't capable of creating suspense or building a gothic atmosphere or maybe he just didn't bother to and the actresses' capacities restrict themselves to standing in front the camera topless and pull a really pathetic face please do yourself a favor no matter how desperately you strive to see all lurid lesbian vampire movies of the 70's this one isn't worth a penny even the repertoires of jess franco and jean rollin are pure art compared to this dud,0
well what can one say firstly this adaptation is far too long at 4 hours for the complexity or lack of such of the plot the actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available swayzee is really not a quatermain character at all after seeing sean connery's interpretation of the great man in the league of extraordinary gentlemen swayzee really does not make the grade this chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength stature subtlety or humour needed for the part and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography for example when the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert their tracks are visible down to the oasis just waiting for them to walk in them climbing out of the mine leads to an exit on the next shot nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through et cetera i was waiting for doug mcclure to appear at any moment in some ways i wish he had br br the leader of the russians pursuing quatermain is a shoddily created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything br br swayzee does quite well as the sad father returned to london who is unable to obtain the custody of his son swayzee should stick to that sort of thing he is not able to carry the part of a courageous gentleman with a stout heart experience of life and sense of fair play br br 4 out of 10 barely,0
men of honor true story about a proud and persistent black navy diver fabulous cuba gooding jr is definitely a great movie that both touches and entertains and it's part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema wonderful acting is the main reason to make this movie something truly special and pretty enjoyable splendid experience charismatic robert de niro is marvelous as rough fierce and pitiless chief billy sunday role is practically written for him this film alongside with fantastic 15 minutes 2001 are two of the latest proofs that he's still one of the very finest actors of our time on the other hand men of honor includes a fine performance from cuba gooding jr who has been one of the most promising young black actors since boyz n the hood men of honor goes straight into the company of jerry maguire as good as it gets and instinct cuba gooding jr is a skillful and fantastic actor and i'm prepared to get lots of more terrific movies from him men of honor has also quite an excellent story line and probably the most exciting diving sequences of the movie history this is a great fascinating movie and i can only recommend it,1
i did watch all of the film through to the disgraceful ending even though i felt so angry at what i saw i felt that the director was screaming for attention and the only way he could achieve this was to be as repulsive as possible since i have lived in the uk i have come to love this country but this film depicts british young people in the worst way imaginable there is nothing to be said but avoid it it will make you angry and sick the people involved should be ashamed,0
the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo 11 and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day br br this would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the whole earth picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window br br i am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in private hands would still be a problem br br ah a response trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data i'd say is a charming but weak and gullible argument what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by u s government that the moon missions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe things are nearly never quite what they seem just watch the movie and i dear say you'll see things a bit different than before br br first off weather data doesn't come from nasa it comes for met agencies around the world second the weather data undermines a major claim in the film third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film so he edited it and added his own interpretation unfortunately for him his source film is public domain and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims,0
three sergeants in the british army stationed in india are sent out to stop an uprising of a tribe of murderers known as the thuggees one of the sergeants cutter leads away from the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by the thuggees lead by the sinister guru gunga din the regiment's water boy goes back to the camp for help and the other two sergeants go after him but are also captured now the major sends a full detail out after the three but do not realize that they are walking into a trap set by the thugees it is though gunga din who saves the day excellently made buddy film even though it is today politically incorrect grant mclaglen and fairbanks do give very humorous and thrilling performances with jaffe very well in the title role and cianelli very sinister as guru rating 10 out of 10,1
i bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to watch it until last night i do like juliette lewis although i'm indifferent to brad pitt after this viewing i have to admit he's a perfectly fine actor his character was entirely believable and i didn't think brad pitt at all br br unfortunately i can't say the same for david duchovny i'm an x files fan and i had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie as i'd thought it was made a few years later i like duchovny but found his character a little two dimensional here except where he's doing voice overs that part was strong seemed in character good intonation etc otherwise i kept thinking agent mulder which is a pity br br michelle forbes was a treat why haven't i noticed her before i'll be looking up to see what other roles she's done and seeing those asap i am slightly concerned about stereotyping re lewis this film and natural born killers a firm favourite interesting though to see a contrast of characters in nbk she's a willing accomplice whereas here she abhors the violence and tries very hard not to acknowledge early's dark side until it's thrust in her face br br i enjoyed this film almost unreservedly apart from duchovny's character not seeming fully formed and perhaps being washed out somewhat by pitt's it was perfect i was also pleased with the ending glad that the innocent heroes did not die yet they had to suffer first it was realistic tense disturbing br br if you like nbk you may well like this movie and vice versa,1
i was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of tigerland it was a liberal's fantasy of how the military should be the dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things colin farrell's character was allowed to get away with by his superior officers br br i kept thinking hey there's a reason why boot camp is tough it's supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit there's no room for cocky attitudes and men who won't follow orders i was rooting for bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers i would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with people's feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit br br br br,0
this is pretty funny saturday the 12th a great work i laughed every minute of the movie this is like scary movie for the 1980's great student bodies styled gags br br too bad this isn't on video but you can still watch it on flix,0
well tenko is without doubt the best british television show ever the performances the directing the casting the suspense the drama everything is fantastic about it br br although the show fell a little later in its final season this ending movie picked up the threads nicely and wove a superb story for fans of the show and newbies i cannot recommend this movie more find it and watch it but i do advise watching the series first as the first 2 seasons are even better than this fantastic movie br br an obvious 10 10,1
he only gets third billing behind arthur treacher virginia field but this was effectively david niven's first starring role and he's charmingly silly as p g wodehouse's dunderheaded bertie wooster master in name only to jeeves that most unflappable of valets as an adaptation it's more like a watered down the 39 steps than a true wodehousian outing and that's too bad since the interplay between treacher niven isn't too far off the mark alas the 'b' movie mystery tropes forced comedy grow wearisome even at a brief 57 minutes next year's follow up step lively jeeves was even more off the mark with no bertie in sight and jeeves of all people forced to play the goof,0
i have to admit right off the top i'm not a big fan of family films these days most of them imho are sentimental crap but this one like toy story the previous film from pixar is a lot of fun the two lead characters were perhaps a bit too bland especially compared to the two leads in antz but otherwise this film is better but the rest of the film more than made up for it the animation looked great the humor though broad was consistently good i especially liked hopper's line if i hadn't promised mother on her deathbed that i wouldn't kill you i would kill you and the actors doing the voices except the two leads were all terrific denis leary doing an animated movie what a concept and like everyone else i loved the outtakes i hope the video has the new ones,1
i dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites it was written by jay alan lerner and directed by vincent minelli it won two academy awards for best picture of 1951 and best screenplay the story of an american painter in paris who tries to make it big nina foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him but soon finds she loves the guy meanwhile gene kelly falls for lovely damsel leslie caron his main dancing partner and i must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise famous french singer georges guietary sings too so if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with oscar levant's nimble piano fingers the songs of george gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem 8 10,1
i hated the first episode of this show 'protesting hippies' so much in 1999 that i shunned the rest however when it came on 'the paramount comedy channel' i watched it in full and to my surprise found it absolutely hilarious motto never judge a comedy series in its first week br br set in 1969 'hippies' stars simon pegg as 'ray purbbs' editor of an 'oz' like underground magazine called 'mouth' his friends are the feminist jill laid back alex and the half wit hugo back in the late '60's there was a feeling of incredible optimism amongst the young that they could change the world through the printing of magazines nobody read rather than sneering at the hippies' naivety 'hippies' is affectionate towards it arthur mathews' scripts cheekily parody a number of that era's icons 'hair' 'woodstock' 'the graduate' even the infamous 'oz' obscenity trial of the early '70's excellent performances from the cast julian rhind tutt's 'alex' strangely put me in mind of the richard o'sullivan character from 'man about the house' its a shame that there was never a second series possibly because of people like me if you missed 'hippies' give it a try once you get past the dire opener you're in for a treat,1
and that's how the greatest comedy of tv started it has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season because that's where friends is based on quotes extraordinary situations are taking place among six friends who will never leave from our hearts let's say a big thanks to rachel ross monica joey chandler and phoebe in our first meet we see how rachel dumps a guy in the church how understand monica's search for the perfect guy there is no perfect guy why all you women are obsessed with that and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian till we meet joey phoebe and chandler in the next episodes enjoy friends,1
it is difficult to find any positives in this movie seems as though the producer needed to make a buck without much effort hence we are treated to a full showing of galaxy which is the lamest excuse for a movie in history the police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms more action shots of the two cops a lot less of galaxy would have been the way to go of course that would add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with that wretched rerun ms albright does excellent looking sexy her acting is first rate ms stabs whom i had heard of but not seen on screen before also looked very desirable but seems to lack basic acting talent apart from ms albright this is real garbage,0
this movie fails miserably on every level i have an idea let's take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east maybe if we're lucky they'll all be shot and killed and we won't have to ever have our time wasted by them again did i mention that i have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life my god i can't think of anything i've ever seen that was this bad i'd rather watch ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film if i ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film i'll spit in their face and then beat them senseless that's my two cents,0
let's think people quit bad mouthing the original for it's time the original battlestar series was a masterpiece even still with all the stars story lines and art lorne greene was great as adama and richard hatch was perfect as apollo and dirk benedict was funny as starbuck but i dare say not as pretty as katee as starbuck br br i loved the episode with the pegasus and greetings from earth was good john calicos was great as baltar war of the gods the best was experiment in terra i thought that was a tribute in a way to heaven can wait then you had the women of battlestar not to compare them to let's say tricia who is outstandingly beautiful as number six but jane seymour's beauty could not be compared to let alone loerrta spang as cassiopea was fantastic she had beauty that a rainbow would be embarrassed by i loved the original as much as the new br br can you imagine if john calicos had a number six br br thankyou for listening,1
this movie is just plain bad it isn't even worth watching to make fun of it the lunatic professor is just plain annoying even suspending disbelief to allow for invisibility which i glady do for the sake of good bad movies and allowing for exceedingly stupid victims in a horror movie this movie asks for even more than that if you are looking for women's locker room shower scenes and random sexual encounters get a porn if you are looking for a good bad movie get something else if you want to simply waste your time on an annoying bad movie rent this,0
the film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast and excellent direction by james eves the movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from stephanie beecham and everyone is perfectly cast james eves has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to crank up the action fall and then rise to a climax he does this with an element of humour plenty of twists thrills and blood this is a return of the old vampire movie with loads of gore blood and screams the movie works at a great speed and the characters take you on a terrific adventure but what makes it work is that the film doesn't take itself too seriously with plenty of tongue in cheek action great,1
the movie takes place in a little swedish town where everybody knows each other here mia visits her parent for the birthday of her father a which occasionally always have some kind of tragedy the question is just what will it be this year and you will be surprised it is an extremely well composed movie with a story which has a perfect balance of humor and seriousness which is rarely seen you get happy you get hurt and basically everything in between finally you can't help falling in love with mia if you are a boy i guess the main actress she is an extremely well chosen actress as a lot of the other actors actresses br br enjoy,1
payback is the game being played in this drama and the revenge plot is undone by the absurd story line that sets the stage for the fireworks that come later why would a man become involved with the trophy wife of a ruthless mob boss in the gangster's own mansion with suspicious henchmen all around why would an unhappy wife encourage the attentions of a complete stranger and expect him to carry her away with him and leave her husband and boredom behind to live happily ever after with her new love surely the hero here kevin costner must have expected a reaction from the cuckold husband that gives the movie an excuse to indulge in senseless gore and violence anthony quinn great actor that he was surely deserved better and madeleine stowe is the tragic figure who suffers greatly as she latches on to her prince charming stowe is okay but her spanish accent doesn't work the cameos of the lesser players are good especially miguel ferrer and john leguizamo and sally kirkland is interesting as a fading rock star,0
wow how bad can it get this was seriously bad not in terms of the gore which was mainly laughable cgi but in acting atmosphere and direction br br the story was dreadful the character arc of the main lead was a total joke within a few nights of stalking vinnie jones he starts to become 'haunted' to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend um are all new york photographers this childish suggestible and weak his character development had absolutely no justification or point whatsoever and by the very end you'll be laughing out loud at the utterly predictable and totally absurd twist his character takes br br the gory moments were clearly just a weak low self esteemed effort to jump onto the modern mtv style gore wagon all cgi blood yet no real emotion whatsoever these parts were unintentionally funny and distracting by their self consciousness wacky camera angles etc br br overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea what could have had atmosphere until the stupid monsters at the end is ruined in favour of 'look at me'style self conscious directing this film wasn't made for and audience it was made for a cv a deeply selfish motive,0
the pervert's guide to cinema 2007 br br if loving cinema makes me a pervert so be it br br if you are a true 'moviefreak' like me then i'm sure you can't get enough of films about film making and i don't mean necessarily the dry documentary know and then i mean a total discourse on the film viewing experience well if that's the case have i got a lulu of a film experiment for you br br in sophie fiennes sister of ralph joseph if you were wondering has noted philosopher cum cinephile slavoj zizek give his analysis on cinema with some impressive and often outrageous takes on everything from the silent era of chaplin thru the modern age of the wachowski brothers analyzing probing and pontificating about the psychosexual underpinnings socioeconomic political and of course indefinable magic of the film going experience with his unflagging determined and near frenetic dissertations to go from explaining how the bates' house in psycho is actually the mirrored psyche of the conflicted norman bates with each level as his ego superego id is one thing but then to suggest the same thing about each marx brother in barely a beat is a remarkable test of faith that wins over the skeptic layman br br although i had no idea who zizek was  he resembles a hybrid of filmmaker brian depalma european actor rade serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers quentin tarantino and martin scorsese  with his sibilant tongue and passion the host comes across as a mad prophet br br fiennes cleverly inserts zizek into several of the film clips' backgrounds peppered throughout making for a humorous tone but still lets the ranting and raving continue full throttle giving pause for argument in three acts covering the gamut of films by the likes of kubrick lynch hitchcock and films as diverse as the wizard of oz the red shoes and fight club br br there's something for everyone and if one man can provoke an argument or at least a reason to discuss a film's themes  even if they are freudian jungian to a fault  then i say this collection of film theory is worth the watch seek it out now if you can before it comes to home video it's the only way to appreciate it,1
this is probably one of brian de palma's best known movies but it isn't his best body double the fury and carrie are better movies but this movie is better than blow out and obsession de palma is very influenced by hitchcock and this movie is a take off on psycho angie dickinson is a bored housewife who is thinking of having an affair and after her psychiatrist played by michael caine turns down an offer dickinson meets a man in a art gallery and she winds up sleeping with him after this point it's best you don't know what happens but there is a murder and nancy allen is a call girl who gets a look at the killer dennis franz is the detective on the case who really doesn't trust allen and she has to find the killer herself it's a pretty good movie but isn't one of de palma's best,1
does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film i love it one of my top 10 films of all time it just makes me feel good i watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over bebe benson michelle johnston is the babe of the film imho i never saw the play but i get angry when i read reviews that say the play was better than the film the two are like apples and oranges the film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work i believe it's only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen aren't changed more than they are this is a very good film it is very satisfying that's all you need to know,1
caught this by accident on a t v showing and could hardly believe how utterly awful the whole experience was by comparison the original a man called horse was spell binding because it held one's interest throughout but this piece of nonsense words fail me it was bad enough to have some kind of a story presented with all the impact of a wet loaf of bread but that error was compounded by the obvious lack of subtitles throughout whenever the so called sioux spoke for goodness sake couldn't the film makers have found enough north american indians who were also actors and near actors to perform as indians in this farrago instead of the imposters they actually used i also found it quite embarrassing watching richard harris cavorting all around the countryside at the obvious behest of the director standing just behind camera telling him to run and jump from pointless point a to pointless point b just to make up film footage and minutes absolutely terrible in all respects,0
let's hope this is the final nightmare this is the epitome of a good thing gone bad okay there is still some enjoyment to be had but only in the most mundane sense rachel talalay had been there for the duration of this franchise had been on the production staff and produced even i don't know what she was thinking but this debacle comes complete with the human video game boy and a guest appearance by br br tom and roseanne arnold i wish i had a clue what she was thinking when she wrote directed this disappointing piece of garbage she even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than an over glorified popcorn movie instead of bearing any resemblance to horror with the contrived use of a 3d ending aren't those glasses nifty and you get to keep them it's the equivalent of you just spent 9 00 making me rich here's 10 cents now don't you feel special sorry but for me it just did not make me feel special br br and freddy's had yet another face lift this one was for the worst i think all the beautiful artistry that went into his look in the earlier films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper less detailed set of prosthetics he looks less like the burn victim he is supposed to be and more like he has a skin disorder changing the lead's makeup like that so far into a series is about on the same level as changing the lead actor but wait they've done that and done that so i guess it doesn't matter but it mattered to me freddy is no longer scary he's just another low rent monster like the leprechaun br br it's more a dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises riddled with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty one liners and clever repartee sadly it fell short on both accounts br br so there's nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh because there was not one scary or suspenseful moment in this entire film br br it rates a 3 2 10 from br br the fiend,0
i'm a fan of crash and blade runner and this movie explores some of those highway death and 80s film noir themes that i like to see so i enjoyed it br br in general though the essential stupidity of the film noir protagonist is not pulled off well by the female lead and her hero is nearly a neanderthal hence the kitch warning,1
if you are hoping for anything new you have chosen the wrong movie who can think that a movie that is a virtual replay of it's predeccesors can be good maybe the producer and maybe the director but hopefully they were not serious when they made this thing this whole movie is like making a greatest hits dvd of the 1st 3 films but changing the actors bhhaaaad,0
as others have commented i checked this out after siskel and ebert listed this as one of their top 10 movies of the year what a gift i then went out to buy it just so that i could loan it out br br best quote dwight yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone cage is on top of his cab when cage peers down he apologizes i'm sorry if i scared you yoakum thrusts his pistol in cage's face with does this look like i'm scared great bit of humor after an exciting and temporary escape br br there really was a sense of fun to this the constant sighting of the welcome to red rock sign elicits a groan and a smiling head shake the music created a hunting eerie quality to the film reminiscent of twin peaks unlike twin peaks though it doesn't spoil things by going too far into the outlandish needing to top itself br br i admit watching the credits 15 20 times you see they had yoakum's thousand miles from nowhere perfectly chosen playing as a freight train curved around down to the desert floor with snow capped mountains in the distance this was incredible fluid framing further i've never seen a better unification of sight and sound on film also it totally fit the story,1
like all cult tv shows there is a group of people who love the twilight zone so much that they rate practically every episode like they are the greatest shows ever while several of them are indeed wonderful classics the truth is for every great episode there were several that were mediocre and at least one that stank however like die hard trekkies these zone lovers insist that all of them are gold in fact this is what initially got me to review some individual episodes of a couple cult series instead of the movies i usually watch br br while this isn't the worst episode ever made nor is it among the very worst it is poor by any reasonable standard a widow watches a long procession of civil war soldiers going past her home in the end a very unexpected twist is revealed and there isn't a whole lot of excitement or suspense here,0
taped this late night movie when i was in grade 11 watched it on fast forward i sugest you do the same i though it would be and action film but went to a cort tv type movie in the end it fits in with the early 70's social activest type films glad i missed that era 2 10,0
war is hell but this documentary of wwii is heaven br br not only is this series a breath taking almost exhaustive look at the second world war it's a poetic masterpiece told clearly and superbly by laurence olivier br br this documentary series defines the genre it's sweepingly long no doubt but you will enjoy all of them and want to come back for more and more i have the series on dvd and i probably watch the series three times a year br br truly this is an impeccable bit of film making other than olivier the best part of the series is listening to the veterans tell their stories whether it be about an actual battle or about finding a hog to butcher so they could have something delicious for supper br br i'm going to go watch it right now again my 11th time,1
while being an impressionable youth when first experiencing the gundam wing series upon re watching the series i have reconfirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated but the plot the gundam design character design and character depth are masterfully executed while at first appearing like a boy band of sorts the stylish attractiveness of the characters can partly be credited to just great art with individual personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions among the characters consequently it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character personally i liked heero because of his stoic personality while i may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood i can objectively say that gundam wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general how can we obtain peace while providing action packed battles in large robot suits which to say the least is excellent,1
we showed this movie at the local film society and the art house crowd had the time of their cinematic lives it's tasteless groovy and very funny in a sixties kind of way the kraft kitchen recipe sketch had them laughing like maniacs the rest is a mixed bag but the highs definitely beat the lows by the way whatever happened to ken shapiro,1
this was the eighth and final columbia whistler film and the only one without richard dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year it's still a competent thriller the machine carried on without him perfectly but  something was missing dix the stories in the whistler series were always interesting sometimes brilliant the screenplays often noir always atmospheric but it wasn't only the whistler himself that hung it all together on screen dix did too br br young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad is the potential groom put off even when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams or is love blind who's twisting who is the question michael duane in his penultimate film is ok if a bit of a wimp lovely lenore aubert's finest moments came next film in abbott costello meet frankenstein and richard lane was wonderful as ever on loan from boston blackie also the only outing where the whistler himself must have got wet from slouching about in the rain unless he got sprayed with sea foam in voice br br a lot happened in this last hour well worth watching over and over again as usual to fans of the genre like me the whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows nearly all of which are available on mp3 and based upon what i've heard so far nearly all of which are well worth listening to as well,1
i went to see it 2 times this movie a friend of mine went to see it at the release party and he was telling me it was so great that i was expecting very much about the movie to mutch i couldn't enjoy it because i was not watching it in nuteral position the second time i knew what to expect and i enjoyed it more than the first time after the second time i felt so in the mood to have a party i loved the music it's just great br br if tom barman improves his directing talent he will be a director where everyone will be talking about if you can delivere this movie as your first you must be talented br br the acting is done by some great belgian stars dirk roofthooft and a bunch of upcomming talents like titus de voogdt br br,1
in texas seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the halloween night before going to a party meanwhile they call the american nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears a serial killer who is listening to their confessions makes their nightmares come true killing each one of them in a sadistic way american nightmare is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning without any previous explanation a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area as if it were friday 13th then the story shifts to a bar where seven friends are celebrating halloween from this moment on the story has a great potential and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies as usual in this type of c production however the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse jane toppan giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting with a better beginning and conclusion this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie my vote is four br br title brazil agonia agony,0
i am a member of a canoeing club and i can tell you the truth that deliverance is synonomous with the peacefulness and tranquility of the experience as we put our boats into the water banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind this movie is timeless because it waxes philosophical of human's place in nature and technology's effect upon man's relationship with nature we see it in the bow fishing we see it in the home made tent there is also city man's disdain and feeling of superiority to the rural woodsman cracker the fact that the banker from atlanta ned beatty has bad teeth is meant to put him on the same level with the woodsmen who also have bad teeth ultimately the struggle of life and death supersedes civilized man's suppositives about the law this canoe trip ends too soon for the viewer but alas not soon enough for the characters,1
i've watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it wasn't as successful commercially or artistically as it should have been and discovered considerable artistic merit which may ultimately have been its commercial undoing br br first of all this movie attempts serious science fiction social commentary more than action adventure there is action in it but that's not really what it's about if you focus on that you'll end up with as others have noted a bad aliens clone but again that's not what it's about br br the movie is really about todd's kurt russell transformation from human to near machine and back to human mostly back but because it's not trying to give you a typically glib hollywood style answer kurt russell must make this transformation without speaking and largely without broad expressions and he really does a wonderful job it can take two viewings to appreciate it br br the surrounding social logic is flawed and it's never adequately explained whether todd's ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound human ness or what but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for russell's easy to underestimate talent,1
i notice that the previous reviewer who appears to be still at school gave this movie a very good review and i can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasn't seen the far superior 1989 bbc adaptation of this classic novel the major problem i had with this 1999 version was the casting of anthony way as tom long anthony way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the tv mini series the choir i can only assume that he was cast for the role of tom long on the strength of his excellent acting in the choir unfortunately the small boy who appeared in the choir had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time tom's midnight garden was filmed and as such anthony fails to convince as schoolboy tom it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that tom as played by anthony would befriend the far younger hatty in the 1989 bbc version tom and hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable for a 1999 movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the 1989 tv effects the casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic as a final observation i would point out that the vhs of the 1989 bbc version fetches well over £20 00 second hand whereas a new dvd of this version can be bought for under £5 00 need i say more,0
this movie was just plain dumb i do not think it was scary at all i went in hoping to be shocked and scared but was mostly laughing some of the scenes were just to fake and thrown together blood scenes were extremely over cg and some of the mutants were ridiculously gay looking it also sucked because the acting was just plain horrible u think they could get some good actors and most of the characters i hated just because how stupid and lame they acted even though they were supposed to be in the military i get to watch movies for free and seen many people walking out im guessing because it was so dumb kinda glad i didn't have to pay for it in short dumb ass movie don't see it but then again thats my opinion,0
if you are planning to rent or buy this movie don't it's the worst thing i have ever seen i would comment on it more but it has been 10 years since i saw it and have blanked all of it from my mind save yourself some time money and well being and stay far far away,0
this version of moby dick insults the audience by claiming it is based on melville's novel even going so far as to show a phony first chapter sentence rather than the famous call me ishmael in addition to having atrocious acting even from john barrymore this is perhaps the greatest example of how far hollywood especially early hollywood would go to revise and change a famous novel just to beef up its chances at the box office all of the novel's beautiful poetic language has been absolutely eradicated and ahab has been changed from a brooding blasphemous obsessive madman to a dashing misunderstood hero who only wants to kill moby dick after his fiance turns away from him after seeing his wooden leg to this is added the standard evil brother who wants the fiance for himself and a different ending,0
this movie is just like every other dutch movie so if you enjoy movies such as turks fruit and de kleine blonde dood then you might be okay with this one even though those two have much better stories and actors zomerhitte starts strong enough but even that one good scene ends up having nothing to do with the storyline there's a lot of nudity but me and others just could not find that girl attractive the dialog is laughable as we did a lot to the annoyance of other movie watchers and some of the scenes are so completely random that this is more of an unintentional comedy than anything else like a random scene in which an owl rips somebody's eye out it has nothing to do with anything and is only referenced once later in a sentence saying did you hear what happened i was there the only reason i gave it a 2 is because some of the places they are at look nice that's it and the reason i saw it was because we went to the sneak preview here in holland we have a strange system regarding sneak previews you pay less money then for a regular movie and you don't know what movie it is that you will be watching all you know is that it's a new movie that's not yet in the theaters my advice is to stay far away from this film if you really want to see a good dutch movie watch temmink or zwartboek,0
this film is massively boring and pretentious there is only one good moment when a sailor shaves mr barney's think the purple dinosaur less pretense eyebrow the music is relentlessly cloying it is sad that bjork someone with so much inner beauty has been brought down to pretentious falsity in her art the pomp of the tea service makes a beautiful ritual seem vapid the mythology and culture are not respected in this film they are lifted not just from japanese culture but from another filmmaker stay tuned in a perfect art imitates life moment the crew of the ship finds a giant piece of sh t which is what the audience found in the theatre there are some set pieces which are very composed and arty without heart thenprepare for spoilers i'm talking to you mr barney br br the emperor has no clothes mr barney you have been outted i have seen jodorowsky's holy mountain and your thin fake veil of bs has been lifted you have stolen your images your style and your entire art catalogue from this man now that holy mountain has been released finally let's hope the powers that be at the art councils of the world stop financing you poor jodorowsky lost in a financial battle with the beatles lawyer when he is the lennon mccartney of film making and btw while jodorowsky is the beatle you are the monkees a cheap thin soulless rip off only liked by facile kitschy college freshmen and btw i am a filmmaker if you are interested in making a reality film i will legally fight you in a ring defending jodorowsky you defending outright thievery,0
the story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring some of the audience seemed to find it funny but i like more intelligent humor br br there were several known swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script lena endre was good looking as always br br i don't remember the original movie so i can't say if it's better or worse br br if you enjoy movies like sällskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at,0
it's a shame that this piece of work wasn't acknowledged as a piece of work it has everything a historical film must have a serious historical research outstanding performances of every actor involved and a discrete but great direction br br when i saw the movie i knew it should be a prototype for every biographical movie,1
i got to see the movie on thin ice on the television in india i must say the movie was really well done and really sent a chill down my spine the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain addicted br br however i felt that diane keaton was at her best the scene where she has cravings and begins rummaging her home for cocaine was the best the two boys are good and lynda boyd also showed what a good actress she is the script is well done as is the cinematography and direction and casting br br a must must watch movie for everyone,1
jim henson's muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood this film makes me feel like a kid again okay the muppets are back with miss piggy and kermit the frog and their friends the premise is that they are trying to get on broadway in a musical show in where else but new york city you will see cameos by the then new york city mayor ed koch anyway the film turns 25 this year and i hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the muppets gang the problem with the show is kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in new york city it's worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like myself,1
ok so this is coming a few weeks late but it is here mostly this is because of statements of various negative natures starting with the technology when star trek tos ran special effect technology was extreamely low tec and more than that the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups in the 35 years seince tos premiered the crew of star trek have become experts at economy br br ultimately they have decided quite rightly in my mind to abandon the look of tos and reverse engineered tng et all so what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from star trek ii as for the nits being picked about first contact with the klingon empire it was presumed based upon comments made by kirk and riker that earth only met the klingon's in 2200 nothing was firmly established br br enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that we've seen in a while this is what voyager could have been no series can evolve without a few inconsistancies but be thankful that star trek has so few so quit gripping and enjoy,1
more eeriness and dark secrets released in the final parts of lars von trier's fantastic horror satire the kingdom much more is revealed and the ending just leaves you begging for more plus a great performance from udo kier in a more substantial role,1
suggesting nothing less than a movie length version of the 1970s tv hit love american style decked out with flashes of nudity superchick 1973 is a lighthearted piece of fluff that somehow still manages to entertain and the lead character here tara b true really is some kind of superchick a stewardess not flight attendant who's so good looking that even her plane's autopilot has made a pass at her and with a hunky boyfriend in every port this wingin' swingin' gal really does put the lay in layover what with her germaphobe surgeon beau in new york her playboy with gangster problems in miami and her creatively challenged rock star dude in l a tara sure does keep busy and when she's not draining these guys of all their manly energies as the viewer learns she's liable to be taking a karate class mile high clubbing fending off flashers and rapists attending groovy pot parties and stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane as i said lighthearted fun and surely good for a night when you're feeling somewhat brain dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube future astrologist joyce jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as tara and the film looks handsome enough to please disappointingly buxom '70s faves uschi digard and mary gavin aka candy samples are wasted here in very small roles but still get to do what they do best show off their chesticles though the picture is never laff out loud funny and doesn't really have many thoughts in its metaphorical head it does succeed in being consistently amusing and i suppose that is something strange that the end credits should call attention to ms jillson's body double however don't think i've ever seen that before,0
well that's 90 minutes of my life i won't get back this movie makes teen tv show california dreams look like almost famous the acting was horrid and storyline unrealistic don't even get me started on the actual band at the forefront of this story lame songs look etc you had to believe that they were one of the hottest bands in the country and there isn't enough irony in the world to accept that one the guitarist is seen to be a heroin user not that i blame him if i was around such a putrid band with stale songs and wooden acting i'd be injecting the horse too br br if you take music remotely seriously avoid this at all costs,0
this movie was a stupid piece of crap bad everything why is it that we who love western movies get jilted nine out of ten times when renting westerns it seems that if you don't see names like robert duval kevin kostner or tom selleck attached to the cover it isn't worth messing with for the most part the main action of shiloh falls was taking place in 1892 yet the revolvers used were 1860s models even the shooting was bad in one scene the marshal fanned his six shooter about nine times and couldn't hit any of three large men who were only about twenty feet away i had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this inanity perhaps those who participated in this movie could have taken some lessons at the sunset carson school of acting,0
i wish i could give this movie a zero out of ten before going to this movie the day after it came out i came on imdb to check out the comments a comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog i never go by other people's opinions so i wasted seven dollars for this crap movie it had to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen br br the person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff since when do scary movies have sappy scenes i swear i'm amazed there weren't any group hug moments br br i think i jumped once and that's because i zoned out thinking about my research paper for english the clichéd birds cat popping out of nowhere thing when you thought something was gonna happen br br and the characters were stupid my friend and i almost died laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said i have to get my mom's shawl you idiot screw the shawl safety is just a few steps away but no my mom's shawl that didn't match the dress by the way is wayyyy more important than my health and safety and to top it all off they take her back to her house knowing that the killer knew where she lived god br br my friend and i also predicted the entire movie and not just the i bet he's hiding under the bed moments it was the he stole the bellhop's clothes and sneaked out of the hotel and it's the detective coming down the hallway not the killer moments movies should never be this predictable disney movies aren't even this predictable br br i'm gonna complete my rant now by saying this was a terrible movie i'm glad i went to see it in theaters so i wouldn't buy it for 15 00 and then hate it it was just bad it would've been better if only one thing would've happened if after being shot by the detective the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in knife in hand falling and stabbing the girl on his way down oh how lovely that would've been br br don't waste your time or money go see a good movie,0
in my eyes this is almost the perfect example of hollywood ego only beaten by the new king kong movie superman is the original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears tights brandon routh was the worst superman i've ever seen from the start of the movie u just wanna shove a chunk of kryptonite down his throat he looks just silly wearing the costume but enough about him kate bosworth was a bad choise for lois lane she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl the plot was weak and predictable wow he is actually supermans son who would have ever thought and the acting was horrible this movie has one good thing going for it and it's name is kevin spacey his portrayal of lex luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie what this movie needed was the cast of lois and clark except kevin spacey of course and a different story i watched this movie after watching the hills have eyes and i was chocked to learn that there existed worse movies then that,0
richard widmark is a tainted character in this movie he is a professional pickpocket he's been in prison three times yet at the beginning of the film he tries to make it four thelma ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everybody jean peters is amazing as the girl flamed by widmark br br this is a period piece during the mccarthy era where the red scare ruled the politics and is worked into this plot quite nicely what is unusual about this film is that peters ritter are both victims of violent beatings in an era where women were seldom more than sex objects in films this is what makes this film noir as women often got different roles in this type of film br br the film is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by fox as the under card for double features in the theater the sets show it is a limited budget film the script made j edgar hoover mad because patriotism is given short shrift hoover wanted it changed br br instead it became a b under card picture that was a sleeper hit in 1953 the script acting in it are better than other big features were that year,1
this is a good example of how not to make a film br br there is very little meaningful dialog no context for the events and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes the result is a confused clueless viewer the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's commentary br br this movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is with an emphasis on child abuse it includes some stock footage of real horrible acts of violence including war time executions although it works in the context of the movie i feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content this film is absolutely not for the weak stomached or the easily offended and should not under any circumstances be shown to minors br br the climax is anti climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie if you're not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it br br the director's commentary was a one shot sit the guy down and let him talk no cuts type of commentary while this isn't necessarily bad the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college filming conditions co producers bad film and a dozen other things the constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie br br the movie was shot many years ago on 16mm and super8 film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget because of this the video and audio quality is poor that alone does not make it a bad movie but it does make a bad movie worse,0
the ogre is a film made for tv in italy and wasn't intended to be a sequel to demons as lamberto bava even mentions it on the interview on the sheirk show dvd but it was called demons iii to be part of the demons series the music in demons and demons 2 was 80's rock music while this is more creepy music and while the first two was gory horror demons iii the ogre is a architectural horror so that's how demons iii isn't a proper sequel to demons but i still like this film br br the music is creepy and that adds a tone to the castle that the film is set in the ogre is another thing why i like the film there are two other films that are classed as demons iii and that is black demons demoni 3 and the church demons 3 demons iii the ogre is a good film as long as you don't compare it with demons and demons 2,1
well here we have yet another role reversal movie there were many worth watching despite the tired plot of gender reversal however this one is not in previous reviews i think i've made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for haim movies that followed the late 80s this is one of them br br 'just one of the girls' is about a high school kid corey haim who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school he joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader marie nicole eggert obviously he can't keep up the charade for too much longer br br i thought this movie was utter crap and it wasn't even funny but judging by a majority of reviews it looks like fans of alanis morrisette or teen sex queen nicole eggert are the only ones who'd want to watch this if you're looking for a good haim feature or role switching comedy look no further than 1989 this is about the point that haim's career tanked,0
this movie starts slow then tapers off after watching for about an hour and seeing absolutely nothing happen i walked out i mean nothing happened zero zip nada there is no story the characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know the producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a motion picture there is no motion i could have told the same story with a couple still pictures with captions the script is a joke it's just awful i doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it my biggest regret is not that i wasted 60 minutes of my life watching love in the time of money but that i missed a great opportunity to be a leader i could have been the first to walk out but i waited a bit too long instead i watched about 20 people walk out before me,0
begin spoiler fitfully funny and memorable for mr chong's literal roach smoking scene chong coolly mashes a stray kitchen cockroach into his pipe's bowl lights up coughs and hacks violently for a seeming eternity then with perfect aplomb and not skipping a beat re loads the bowl properly re lights re tokes end spoiler alas i began to lose faith less than half way through the proceedings it occurred to me that the lackadaisical duo are way obnoxious and less than relatable i have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary stoners harold and kumar i simply prefer brighter company yet the movie is probably a perfect fit for baked frat bros or those viewers who are so feeble minded as to be outwitted by a stoner when they the former are sober notable guest appearance by paul reubens spouting obscenities in pre pee wee form,0
the film was very outstanding despite the nc 17 rating and disturbing scenes in reality things like this do happen and that is why this movie shows a lot of it it all starts with maya rosario dawson in superb performance whose recently started attending college has everything going well for her she meets jared chad faust in a terrific performance at a frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet he invites her out to dinner they look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment they talk and takes her to the basement were they become flirtatious with each other she tries to put an end to it but he rapes her this incident scars her she goes to a club meets a bartender dj adrian greatfully played by marcus patrick who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes to far they strike a friendship he also does drugs and maya starts using as well in other words introduces her to a different world she starts going back to school and working as ta teaching assistant and spots jared as one of the students while the students are taking a midterm she catches jared cheating jared tries to smooth talk maya but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place will history repeat itself or will maya have a surprise for jared you watch the movie excellent a rosario dawson portrays the role with focus and endurance chad faust does not like he can be a rapist but he does a terrific job as jared marcus patrick is very brilliant the man who saves maya and coaches her into a new world this film deserves an award,1
i went to a prescreening of this film and was shocked how cheesy it was it was a combination of every horror thriller cliché trying to comment on many things including pedophilia satan worship undercover cops affairs religion and it was a mess the acting was pretty washboard the kid and the jesus dude were alright but apart from them anyways i admire the effort though slightly failed on the attempt at showing the christian people in a different way even though they did that the way it presented the gospel was a bit stock and kiddish but then again it may have to be since he was talking to a little kid no actually i've decided it's just all around bad music oh my gosh horrible toooo over dramatic okay i felt bad for the people who made this movie at the premier it seemed like a poor student project i'm going to stop ranting about this now and say bottom line go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on crap there you go,0
in a way this film reminded me of jumping jack flash remember whoopi goldberg at the shredding machine whoopi zonked out tranquilizers whoopi as blind lemon and imitating mick jagger great moments captured on film for sure but the movie still kind of sucks right that's how i feel about rich in love a man hears his wife sing for the first time post coital teenagers talk about the nature of love albert finney eats ice cream out of bucket and in another scene has a lovely waking moment regarding his absent wife alfre woodard adds another colorful character to her acting wardrobe but there's only the whisper of a plot here and you can't wait for it to get moving only when ex go gos' charlotte caffey's the graces revs up a great pop song does the picture wake up and then it's over br br this picture is the equivalent of a lazy summer's day in the deep american south,1
there was something here with the female lead having this perfect life she's always wanted after the worst life possible beginning as a child prostitute and winding up with eric roberts but her background makes it impossible for her to trust dean cain and this utterly destroys it in the end it sounds weird but i like the position dean cain was in at the end and the choice he made he can't hurt her because he loves her and she's the mother of his child i think the time frame makes it clear it's his child and not his brother's but at the same he can't forgive her for all she's done sleeping with his brother which shows the love and obligation he felt was pretty much one way and then being part of his death in better hands this would have been a better movie but for something i caught on late night cable it's not bad,0
there are some extremely talented black directors spike lee carl franklin billy dukes denzel and a host of others who bring well deserved credit to the film industry then there are the wayans brothers who at one time 15 years ago had an extremely funny television show'in living colour' that launched the career of jim carrey amongst others now we have stupidity substituting for humour and gross out gags toilet humour as the standard operating procedure people are not as stupid as those portrayed in 'little man' they couldn't possibly be a baby with a full set of teeth and a tattoo is accepted as being only months old baby comes with a five o'clock shadow that he shaves off it is intimated that the baby has sex with his foster mother behind her husbands darryl's back oh yea that is just hilarious as a master criminal 'little man' is the stupidest on planet earth he stashes a stolen rock that is just huge in a woman's purse and then has to pursue her co star chazz palminteri why chazz offers the best line i'm surrounded by morons based without credit on a chuck jones cartoon baby buggy bunny this is far too stupid to be even remotely funny a clue as to how bad this film is damon wayans appeared on jay leno the other night prior to the bat awards and he did not even mention this dreadful movie when will hollywood stop green lighting trash from the wayans brothers when they get over their white mans guilt in all likelihood,0
after too many years of waiting anne rivers siddons' noted 1979 book the house next door has finally been filmed the result veers a bit from the novel which especially in the first story of the trilogy is understandable if unsatisfying as it's a tv film the whole of which is absorbing and actually very good just not as great as the book one of stephen king's favorites and one of mine as well br br with more running time and fewer constraints as a theatrical release all the richness inherent in the original three part story of the ominous ultramodern house could have been explored and nurtured especially the climactic revelation near the very end br br still the whole cast does well in this thoughtful tale of mindless malevolence there are a few unnecessary cheap shocks but the growing atmosphere of dread is well developed actually one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting of the house by its next door amateur artist neighbor who is trying to visualize its corruption on canvas br br be sure to read the great novel,1
there is this girl and she's running in the woods but she ends up at this woman's clinic and she wants an abortion her daddy is outside in a van and he is all angry about it the whole episode takes place in and outside of this abortion clinic i'm not really pro choice but i wanted the choice to kill this episode i was laughing when i saw the baby come out and it went into the corner the part where they were doing the ultra sound was pretty funny too i was really feeling sorry for the poor dad in this episode he just wanted to protect his daughter and i couldn't really blame him for what he did i don't know what happened to him at the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room i was just laughing too hard and i would suggest watching pick me up instead of this episode it wasn't the worst episode but it wasn't that great,0
what noise fails to do is get us to understand its character tim robbins plays an obsessive new yorker who can't deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer particularly car alarms it's an odd idea for a film which has about as much creative credibility as death wish it is clever at points particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through hagel i'm too stupid to be understanding this he reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion we read it and don't get it either just then a car alarm goes off throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises though all in all it does little to help us understand our hero who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeper into his persona br br the film making itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems shoddy editing and visible boom mikes no noise isn't all bad william hurt is at least colorful at least the ending doesn't fall flat overall it drives home a logistical point one you haven't probably thought of at least i hadn't though all in all ninety minutes long it couldn't have ended sooner the story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started br br this is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival but probably won't get picked up for distribution check it out on dvd if you're really partial to someone involved in the project otherwise skip it,0
this movie surprised me it had good one liners and laughs a nonstop action packed storyline with tons of gun action and explosions this movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns the plot is solid despite what others may think it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end in conclusion this is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time on,1
reviewed at the world premiere screening sept 9 2006 at the isabel bader theatre during the toronto international film festival tiff br br this had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of ewaste recycled computers keyboards cables etc shipped over to china by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back and other desolation br br the filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to chinese censorship still what was there was interesting the bits of a shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking the opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite something as well scenes of the activity at the three gorges dam project were also a complement to the jia khang je films at tiff the feature still life sanxia haoren the documentary dong which were also built around that subject br br director jennifer baichwal producer nick de pencier cinematographer peter mettler and subject edward burtynsky were all there on stage for a q a after the world premiere producer noah weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in china itself,1
did sandra yes she must have know we would still be here for her some nine years later br br see it if you haven't again if you have see her live while you can,1
or maybe that's what it feels like anyway the bat people is about as flat as a rug bland as a sack of flour and as exciting as a rock and as intelligent as all three combined br br okay plot in a nutshell fitting vessel that a doctor moss gets bitten by a bat while checking out a cave with his wife mcandrew and subsequently turns into a bat well not exactly a bat but a bat like creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victims in a first person camera viewpoint br br but then there's the business of the sheriff pataki who is about the worst kind of sheriff the hick kind he hassles people he leers at married women he steals handkerchiefs from haberdasheries the fiend he smokes with one of those cigarette holders in his mouth and talks at the same time making him look and sound like buford t justice in smokey and the bandit and this is the worst part he's the most likeable character in the whole film br br the whole film though is just tv movie of the week like crapola guano in this case it's an aip for crying out loud what did you expect oscar caliber stuff br br and what else can you say about a film that not even mst3k can save br br how about no stars for the bat people full version or mst3k version br br by the way if there's ever a sequel for this movie i'm burying my tv,0
ghost of dragstrip hollow is a typical 1950's teens in turmoil movie it is not a horror or science fiction movie plot concerns a group of teens who are about to get kicked out of their hot rod club because they cannot meet the rent once kicked out they decide to try an old haunted house the only saving grace for the film is that the ghost paul blaisdell in the she creature suit turns out to be an out of work movie monster played by blaisdell,0
well i suppose the good news concerning william winckler's 2001 opus the double d avenger is that it manages to unite three of russ meyer's mammarian marvels kitten natividad haji and raven de la croix in one picture i can only assume that lorna maitland tura satana and babette bardot were busy the week they shot this thing or else managed to see a copy of the script in advance the bad news though and there's plenty of it is that this film if it can even be called that having been shot straight to video is a complete misfire a total abortion an out and out atrocity an absolute abomination and truly one of the worst pictures that i have ever seen look no further for the lamest superhero movie ever made the plot here such as it is deals with kitten gaining superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in south america to cure her breast cancer oy and later battling a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in l a too bad that every lame boob joke trotted out falls completely you should pardon the expression flat that there is zero actual nudity in the film at all other than some old photos of kitten in her heyday and that some shaving cream and a papier mache boulder are the sum total of the special fx the meyer gals here are a bit long in the tooth saggy in the chest to put it kindly although sheri dawn thomas as bikini girl ooga boobies does manage to uh stand out nicely so why have i given this juvenile unfunny failed embarrassment of a movie 2 stars instead of 1 to be succinct joe bob briggs his voice over commentary in the special features of the dvd i just watched is absolutely hilarious especially when he pulls out around 100 synonyms for the word breast from the 1 000 on his web site's canonical hooters list the man is a national treasure and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a disc to coaster status,0
what can be said really the tenant is a first class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full blown paranoia it's an intricately plotted film every detail seems included for a reason even though the plot seldom makes sense and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable trelkovsky polanski a meek polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenant's suicide to guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty after an apartment warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers trelkovsky comes under increased seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfu k on par with the later efforts of david lynch the tenant however is more brooding and sinister laced with unexpected comic relief fine performances and a truly haunting score it's a movie that's better experienced than described so hop to it,1
two movies back to back which dealt with indian pows veer zaara and deewaar although veer zara was a love story of a guy who gives everything up for someone deewaar focuses on the main subject itself it is not hidden that many indian pows are rotting in pakistani jails for years for whom neither indian govt has time or sympathy nor the other side i'm sure some of pakistani pows are in india as well but let's focus on the movie full of actors some were stage actors like raghubir yadav rajendra gupta etc amitabh bachchan who plays the role of a major acted well akshaye khanna did his part well there was nothing for amrita rao to do than a few giggles and couple songs i think sanjay dutt's role was most solid even though it wasn't too long he acted really well here and his dialog delivery was also impressive if you compare it to loc which was nothing but a day long movie with story going in all directions if it had a story deewaar is a well directed movie that keeps a good pace and does justice to all actors 7 5 10,1
this movie was long and boring surprising that it was selected for cannes although they tend to like pretentiousness point is that contrary to other dutch stars of the arty genre like kerkhof and kruishoop guernsey feels utterly empty even more so it has no cinematic quality whatsoever a long opening shot doesn't mean cinematic depth it's just a long boring shot the story wasn't interesting and the characters had problems i couldn't identify with at all the actors didn't shine under her direction and seemed lost at times leopold tried but she is not the talent i hoped she would be where are kerkhof and kruishoop they really made some waves in dutch cinema leopold just made another attempt,0
spoilers contained in order to make a observation br br twenty years on from 1984 this film speaks loads about prince's future in the music industry br br there is a scene that sums up prince's musical output of the last 10 years perfectly which is if you took the best two songs off his last 10 albums you would have one fantastic album br br the scene plays like this prince runs off to his dressing room after playing one song and the owner of the club enters the dressing room to give prince an earful about his fall from grace during the 90's and putting out albums that only the most hardcore fans would be able to tolerate and support his artistry br br club owner you're not packing them like you used to the only person that digs your music is yourself br br spooky huh how about the musical underscore which makes prince even more evil when he smacks apollonia to the ground in two separate scenes it gave me chills that that was not the only scene women where mistreated in this film br br i'm all for the comedy sparring's between morris day and jerome benton as these two stole every scene they were in but what was funny about throwing a woman into a trash can that was plain nasty the other nasty bit was the chalk outline of prince's father on the floor thoughtfully provided by the minnieapolis police which causes prince to go even more loony fantastic br br purple rain is an entertaining film overall as it is the soundtrack of prince songs that boosts it's value by 110 but then again the film gives us another theory on prince and his music as the film tells us that prince's biggest song of the film is written by wendy lisa and princes wife beating musical father br br are prince and the filmmakers trying to tell us that prince stole all his best songs from his father after finding his fathers music sheets of written songs maybe that is why prince started to run out of steam during the 90's because he ran out of his fathers ideas hmmmm,1
this film reminds me a lot of the anti drug films of the 50's and 60's due to the fact that it was made by people that have obviously never experienced the social evil that they are warning us about tom hanks and his buddies are role playing but there are no dice lots of candles and then you are just swept away in a bad montage showing hanks falling for the lady in the group quite funny but misguided i wonder how many poor kids had their d d stuff destroyed and were told that the use of their imagination was the road to destruction as a film it's basically an after school special bad acting although hanks does show some of his talent and relationship talks and no one seems to be having any fun it seems these films have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the road to adultism which is more serious apparently and requires you to buckle down and do the things everyone else does despite my vote of 2 this is worth watching due to its unique genre scare films which i personally find quite funny,0
this was an excellent film i don't understand why so many people don't like it there was so much in it to connect with so many beautiful images and so much compassion in the things that weren't said i was thoroughly entertained and was left with a feeling of joyous exuberance just as i am when i finish most any tom robbins story now i haven't read this particular book of robbin's so i don't now how this matched up but i can't imagine this movie could have been a very bad interpretation the movie left a lot for you to define yourself which is the best part of any tom robbins novel dreaming up the details br br to all of you who said this was the worst movie ever i pity what little must be left of the dimming light in your hearts far from the worst ever this movie was glorious long live the whooping crane,1
this movie isn't worth the film it was photographed on the dialog is flat filled with cliché overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time the choppy shaky film style is a cheap imitation of the the ring style visual effects the characters do not even act like a normal person would for example the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she doesn't even once call out her sister's name to see if she is home what you would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her way too many flashbacks to her childhood too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director it is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street up the driveway around this corner over here over there oh a side view now a front view enough already you would think you are watching a tv commercial for the solaris terrible movie 0 out of 100 i really pity anybody who spent money making this film or to watch it,0
the thought of sarah silverman having her own show worried me at first the films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off however i was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this comedy central gem i could possibly put her on par with the likes of amy sedaris in strangers with candy sarah's character is a true sociopath very comparable to sedaris' jerri blank br br the one downfall of this show is its supporting cast her sister's character is good funny at times but ultimately meant not to steal sarah's show however the rest of the cast is extremely sub par in comparison br br i'm glad though that comedy central has given sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor,1
this film was slated to be a blockbuster film and it really is this is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics with that in mind the movie delivers perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy iron man but well enough outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects the film drops off of the cliff faster than wile e coyote br br many viewers myself included will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered but that only makes the film a poor adaptation not a poor film this film is unsatisfactory for other reasons the makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind the characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to 4 scene cameos the main characters of wolverine victor creed never called sabertooth in the film and colonel stryker are well developed i was pleasantly surprised by liev schriber's performance the rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eye candy wolverine's character is fully developed after 30 minutes as is sabertooth though victor does pull off some surprises late in the film br br the final boss of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is the filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular character br br very disappointing,0
i am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film thought visually stunning like all of ang lee's work each still frame seems worthy of a print i was really disappointed by the film's disjointed pace it really was too long br br the story is set in civil war era missouri and is about a young man roedel who joins the feral forces of the bushwackers sort of renegade confederate sympathizers who conduct geurilla type fighting with the jayhawkers their union counterparts he and his close friend jack bull chiles played by skeet ulrich join the group after chile's father is shot point blank and his home is burned presumably by jayhawkers the story follows roedel's and chiles' raiding adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war including former slave who fights for the bushwhackers daniel holt played by jeffery wright and a war widow played by jewel br br it seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped for example the agitation among roedel's group caused by former slave holt participating in the confederate cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding propriety and protocol and then dropped until later in the movie a young villian bully bushwhacker hates roedel and directs much angst and violence against him but we never know why some of the characters never seem to surface i think that is because the movie embraces too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of history br br the historical detail was excellent i loved looking at the housing furniture clothes etc and i thought the lead actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters though they stumbled a bit with the dialog unless you really enjoy history or are a huge ang lee fan though take a pass on this one,0
typically terrible trash from director fred olen ray about a female cyborg hunter teagan commissioned by warden jan michael vincent to find and execute escaped alien convict ross hagen who has charted course for earth soon forest ranger john phillip law will have to protect a group of obnoxiously hammy college kids headed by the grating richard wiley who ran over hagen with his rv on a camping trip gone awry soon the cyborg will be blasting away with her arm laser burning one innocent alcoholic doctor robert quarry of count yorga vampire fame proving that no one will stand in it's way of retrieving the hide of the convict whose collar is a tracking device that weakens his body law finds an ally in leo gordon an old vietnam war vet with way too weapons stashed in his cabin br br perhaps intentionally made awful this features what fans of rancid cinema yearn for dreadful special effects acting and premise at least the film has pj soles for some eye candy even in '89 she was quite smokin' that laser gun sure is funny it can incinerate some houses yet when the cyborg shoots at law it barely leaves a mark on the location fired,0
i won't say this movie was bad but it wasn't good either i expected something good but i guess hum aapke hain kaun was much better than this this was completely old fashioned at every stage of this movie i hoped for some twist and what do i get the girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love br br despite of being engaged they have to take permission for every little move they make they are so darn shy even after so many meetings i expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that all she did was crib madly br br hey we have kids too but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always this movie is a dream happy family one cruel woman good in laws and a man who loves her to death in hahk anupam kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa and i somehow knew that mohnish behl would be in this movie anyway i believe i wasted my time i give it a 2 10,0
i'll start with what i liked br br i really liked the songs everything about them was great the costumes music lyrics as long as the translation was good choreography everything br br i loved the crab scene and the cooking scene br br but that's about it br br i get it arty cinema blablabla but too much is too much too much silence it was interesting for an hour but two hours of hearing steps and moaning from time to time really too much boredom no movie should ever be boring no matter how deep it was to be too much porn like scenes i do get it really i get that they were filming a porn movie there but really really really that is too much i truly think that cinema should be for watching and this one is definitely not watchable in no way br br 3 stars for the songs,0
unhinged follows the typical plot of the early 80's slasher trend pretty young girls in peril i have to give it up for the filmmaker who used a helicopter for some of the early road trip shots you actually think for a second there's going to be quality in the production watching unhinged was like seeing an amateur acting class go through it's warm up some of the most awkward badly lit overlong scenes are played out with the gusto of a valium overdose i wondered why they didn't just put the cue cards on camera so the actresses wouldn't have to constantly shift their gaze the two main girls were obviously chosen for their t a factor rather than talent laurel munson as the main chick terry is as exciting as watching paint dry two nude scenes make for an adolescent thrill janet penner and virginia settle as the crazy creepy daughter and mother the chicks find themselves stranded with compete for worst acting ever long pauses weird expressions emphasis on the wrong word it's all there and is a delight for those of us out there who love bad films the scenes shift suddenly with long black outs you could drive a mack truck through cartoon lightning crashes across shots without even bothering to show the sky eighties eyeshadow assaults the viewer but ya know it grew on me i felt sorry for it i wanted to hug it kiss it's boo boos and make it better the ending doesn't make up for the damage it's caused but i grinned anyway i have my own theories regarding the whole banned hype and hope that anyone who chooses to view this film does so with substantial substance abuse and a sense of humor otherwise pass,0
just kidding this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen it was so bad though that it was hilarious my friend and i purposly rented it because it looked so bad cheesy old horror flicks are always good for some laughs the plot stunk some of the voices were dubbed the quality was horrendous but i sure had a blast watching it,0
why would any legitimate actor having read the script participated in this piece of crap my god it is actually embarrassing to even watch it i can't imagine the shame these people must feel for being a part of it also there is apparently some controversy as to whether river phoenix had a cameo in the movie he was uncredited but his list of roles here imdb does give him credit btw rain is his sister for those who have were asking before this film is proof that no matter how many big names you have sow's ears don't make silk purses i love lorraine bracco but this was just sad sad sad maybe somebody someday can explain to me the reason for this kind of film it has no endearing entertaining or even comedic properties in comparison to it's bad everything else,0
being a slasher film aficionado i typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain i will say while channel surfing the other night sleepaway camp ii happened to cross paths with me of course i wanted to check it out as i had heard of the sleepaway camp franchise but have never actually seen any of them for shame i know i will note that since i have not seen the original my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously because perhaps what i think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchise's own design br br now i'm assuming that the franchise of sleepaway camp is in itself a joke on itself hell even the name comes off as an intentional joke sleep away camp it's good fun i can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value but that's about as far as i can go the acting in this movie made the cast of the original friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of macbeth campy requires bad acting but come on pamela springsteen as the evil out of touch with reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast as far as comedy goes there were a few times where i chuckled but it was few and far between br br ultimately sac ii is pretty boring and i really did want to sleep away the camp the deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them if you're looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp i recommend club dread if your channel surfing takes you across this one check and see what else is on,0
first off this really is my favorite film ever i don't need to give anyone a description because every a hole does that i am literally obsessed with this practically bloodless cheesy lame effects having' boom stick showing' badly edited 80's metal horror masterpiece the director i heard had hoped for a hit at the box office so that he could do sequels and have a freddy jason type of deal for himself damn i wish that could've went down like that the soundtrack's banging' the acting's good check this mofo out and any die hard fans out there feel free to email and chat sometime midgetorgy i can be found at yahoo,1
the omega code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency there was a bit but precious little of good acting primarily by the two prophets and rostenberg who only appeared once and had no lines otherwise the acting was decidedly bad the plot line was rather weak and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation certainly not one of the year's best,0
i just watched i q again tonight and had forgotten how much i love this movie it is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world i love the allusions to mozart all throughout from the opening with einstein playing twinkle twinkle little star on the violin to him humming eine kleine nachtmusik during the iq testing of the ed walters i love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career an especially unique situation for the 1950's the time in which this movie is set i myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children so please don't think i am some staunch women's libber it's wonderful how a man who is only a grease monkey is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as catherine's fiance a clinical behavioral researcher the message to me is that we are not what we do but who we are is defined by so much more no labels there are so many little gags and one liners that are almost throwaways if you don't watch and listen carefully br br i did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page in the scene when ed walters is to speak at symposium there are 3 instruments protractor ruler etc hanging on the right from the chalk ledge in the next camera shot there only 2 in the credits on our video it lists tony shaloub's character as bob watters not bob rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on imdb br br i highly recommend this movie it may be a piece of fluff in some estimations but has lots more substance than many give it credit for not only that what a great cast is assembled here watch it and enjoy,1
a low budget effort from texas that's at least filmed well but that is little consolation bad acting or should i say bad over acting a pretty limp story line that's nothing new bad special effects bad bad bad seems like a bunch of young folks are putting together a haunted house for halloween which is done every year but this year things are different has a long extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely fills out the empty spots of which there are a lot putrid puerile definitely avoidable at all costs,0
i'm going to keep this review short and sweet br br i saw the trailer for this and thought i'd give it a whirl 5 minutes in and my initial thoughts were what the hell is this but after 10 minutes i was hooked and after 20 i was picking my jaw up from off the floor this film is a great example of how different a movie can be and furthermore it's french this film is high art eye candy wrapped up in a tidy futuristic film noir package the motion capture is very clever and the black and white animation style which has no grey although at first didn't do it for me totally captivated me and by the end of the film and i found myself wishing every film was made like this i think my opinion was helped by the great dubbing it would have been very easy to ruin it had they not landed so many respected actors as many voice actors give no feeling to the characters just watch any hong kong legends film in english to see a perfect example i gave it 9 although i gave it an extra 2 because of how fresh and new the whole thing feels,1
the show is average it doesn't make me laugh particularly however i think courtney really brings it down she doesn't look natural she has these three ways to talk all robotic she talks quietly with no intonation she talks normally with no intonation or she does that thing where she starts talking normally and starts yelling gradually however her yelling is like let's pretend i'm yelling because i shouldn't be too loud on the set br br she is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing it's annoying you can't really get her personality because she doesn't really produce emotion and doesn't get upset she has this husband who's doing all these stupid things and there is no reaction from her very dry and plain acting,0
1999 will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray first they sent us to eyes wide shut then they hyped up the blair witch project and now magnolia which is by far the worst movie of the year what is it about who the heck knows its full of self indulgence and loaded with bad acting i always like to stay and watch the credits but when this thing was over i couldn't get out of the movie theatre fast enough most of the audience that attended the showing that i was at felt pretty much the same way dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers it's an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful,0
i was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man br br intriguing br br not i hasten to add these women are all drawn in extreme caricature not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other down br br anna chancellor and imelda staunton could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball which doesn't work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small town br br and for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of men sex lust in their lives i felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension the lesbian sub plot went nowhere and those smoking drinking women all 3 in their forties were very unrealistic even in the baby scene screw the baby gimme a cigarette right br br like i said a shame of a waste 4 out of 10,0
the central theme in this movie seems to be confusion as the relationships setting acting and social context all lead to the same place confusion even harvey keitel appears to be out of his element and lacks his usual impeccable clarity direction and intensity to make matters worse his character's name is 'che' and we are only told directly by the narrator well into the film that he is not 'that' che just a guy named che the family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film and once defined the family is divided the younger generation off to america so cliché other reviews discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boy's family however the political stance of the director is murky at best and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed so they lost their property acquired by gambling profits so what refusing to take a political stand when making a movie about the cuban revolution is an odd and cowardly choice not to mention the movie was in english why are all these cubans speaking english no wonder they did not get permission to film in cuba and if family life is most important to look at here it would be great if we could figure out who is who we are 'introduced' to them all in the beginning a cheap way out of making the relationships clear throughout the film the acting was mostly shallow wooden and unbelievable timing was off all around the 'special' visual effects were confusing and distracting references to american films and the black character as greek chorus strictly gratuitous intellectually ostentatious and consistently out of place i only watched the whole movie because i was waiting for clarity or some point to it all it never happened,0
along with fernando fragata joão mário grilo abi feijó leonel vieira étc other commercial directors diamantino costa is one of the best portuguese directors o lampião da estrela was his diamantino costa first movie before he made several successful commercials this title is starred by one of the best portuguese comedians of all times herman josé and josé pedro gomes are great its a very funny movie 28 07 2000 br br boa sorte diamantino,1
even the first 10 minutes of this movie were horrific it's hard to believe that anybody other than john cusack would have put money into this with a string of anti military anti war movies already being destroyed at the box office it's almost inconceivable that a studio of any kind would want itself associated with this script br br at first it may have seemed like some kind of politically motivated derivative of grosse point blank with akroyd and cusack s all over again but only about 90 seconds into the movie it becomes obvious that this is a talentless attempt at dr strangelove br br i liked so many of cusacks movies that i thought i would risk seeing the dvd of this one i have to say that i don't know if cusack is sane enough for me to even watch another feature starring him again unless somebody else can vouch for it cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred for george bush and the iraq war that he is willing to commit career suicide tom cruise was never close to being this far gone not even close,0
if there were two more charming performers than peter ustinov and maggie smith appearing together in a more charming movie in 1968 i don't know who they were i first saw this delightful little satiric gem 25 years ago at the age of 16 and i consider any year in which i have failed to sit down to watch it again a wasted one it's intelligent quirky neat wistful sweet gently subversive and utterly enchanting the romance of these two social misfits is both richly comic and terribly moving never more so than in maggie smith's desperate attempt to bring up the right card in the deck a scene that's both ruefully funny and a perfect thumbnail portrait of heartbreaking loneliness and that final freeze frame on the anxious concerned loving face of ustinov as he asks are you all right has anyone ever made the look and sound of devotion so perfectly and nakedly honest i would never want to know anyone well who didn't love this movie,1
when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like the duchess 2008 but when i saw the first 30 minutes of the young victoria i knew this wouldn't just be a solid movie almost everything in this movie is great the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot br br the only thing that really let me down are the performances emily blunt the devil wears prada is the star of the film bringing victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first oscar nomination for her performance rupert friend is almost bland as prince albert but he has great chemistry with emily blunt paul bettany is also solid as lord melbourne although i expected more of him jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable br br to me the film feels like unfinished maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script i don't know but that's how i feel about the movie br br but overall it's a great movie about the early years of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt,1
this movie was rented by a friend her choice is normally good i read the cover first and was expecting a good movie although it br br was a horror movie which i don't prefer but no horror came to mind while watching the movie it was a dull br br not very entertaining movie the appearance of denise richards br br was again a pleasure for the eye but that's it we the four of us br br we're a little bit disappointed but feel free to see this movie and br br judge it yourself,0
note these comments are for people who have seen the movie br br vanilla sky is a brilliant complex and thrilling movie that existentially explores exactly what the tag line says lovehatedreamslifeworkplayfriends maybe the movie plot can come into focus for confused movie goers if one looks at it from a different angle br br considering the following br br now i have not painstakingly gone through the film scene by scene so i will have to further examine my assertions and i welcome your thoughts but give this a try and see if the movie doesn't fall into place where exactly does the debatable 'splice' occur br br now i'm not talking about the splice as it is explained by the l e 'technician' since that sequence itself could be actually interpreted as a rationalization inside of david aames's mind dream coma state but the true splice between reality and dream br br it seems to me that the reality of the car crash the way that it is filmed no explosion for example is a likely 'splice' point and that any particular sequence containing an existential dream coma non reality feel to it whether it's shown onscreen before or after the crash is actually a part of aames' personal journey toward self realization inside of his own mind br br in that respect then we are left with two questions at the very end if you know of more let me know is aames actually disfigured and where does he wake up br br if you don't get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot or at what particular point his dreams are scattered throughout this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find himself and what that means in today's pop culture society br br,1
the final chapter in the hanzo the razor trilogy provides fitting closure for this entertaining series of samuraisploitation inoue replaces yasuzu masumura blind beast red angel manji in the director's chair but the style is pretty much the same perhaps due to shintaro katsu serving as the producer apart from the titular antihero br br hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake of course hanzo being hanzo he's not put off by the fact she's a ghost so he proceeds to rape ahem interrogate her using the now familiar revolving net device the plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks corrupt officials promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash hanzo's superior officer onishi and his two servants provide the typical comedic notes and generally it's business as usual br br significantly less convoluted and easier to follow than the first which is all over the place and a bit of a mess less stylish dramatic and bloody than the second arguably the finest in the hanzo series but still entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits complete with trademark training sequences the obligatory rape swordfights and a mystery hanzo is called upon to investigate this will ultimately satisfy the fans,1
i'm ask what a f are whit the real tv never i see some b in my life is a dirty f bad and other a things but anything more is just a piece of american s all time britney saying ''oh s i wanna see his cock i wanna f and stuck his d '' and he thinking ''oh like i gone to still her money'' it's just another show of s any one more the only good are what britney sell in interior clothes but noting special noting it's just like i say another s show in this s sill out the money pure sex all f time i just see for i sleep on the before show for this i wanna my f money,0
the cast was good and i thought it was a good performance from christopher lloyd whom i like from previous movies the movie was a great family movie nothing that would make you worry to show it to younger kids a good story line lots of laughs lighthearted and enjoyable if you want to entertain children without being bored to tears this fits the bill kid pleasing and not difficult for a parent to watch either,1
i like films that don't provide the typical happy ending and that's my main reason for my liking of this movie alice marano danes and her best friend darlene beckinsale are arrested in thailand for narcotics smuggling after a tip anonymously phoned in to the thai authorities the film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing as to whether or which of the girls was involved and bill pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer jacqueline kim turns in a terrific performance as his more kind magnanimous wife yon who is also an attorney i wish the girls had been abused more in the prison as another commenter has suggested as i've heard that thai prisons can be quite brutal where this film grabs me however is its ending alice subjects herself to a sentence of 96 years in total so that darlene can be pardoned and we the viewers realize that they are both innocent any film that defies my expectation of the ending wins extra points with me and this well acted drama is certainly deserving,1
i caught this movie about 8 years ago and have never had it of my mind surely someone out there will release it on video or hey why not dvd the ford coupe is the star if you have any head for cars watch this and be blown away,1
i absolutely loved this movie i bought it as soon as i could find a copy of it this movie had so much emotion and felt so real i could really sympathize with the characters every time i watch it the ending makes me cry i can really identify with busy phillip's character and how i would feel if the same thing had happened to me br br i think that all high schools should show this movie maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing i recommend this movie to everybody and anybody especially those who have been affected by any school shooting br br it truly is one of the greatest movies of all time,1
a neat 'race against time' premise a murdered john doe is found to have pneumonic plague so while the health authority and nopd battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts the murderers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding out on them br br this movie is freely available from the internet archive and it's well worth downloading a lot all of this movie was filmed in genuine new orleans locations which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail though to me it does look under exposed even for noir maybe mobile lighting rigs then weren't what they are there is also a plenty of location background noise which is slightly distracting car horns in the love scene anyone there are a lot of non professional supporting artists in crowd scenes and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with not much chance for retakes or recasting though the final chase is worth hanging on for there's not much wrong with the lead actors either jack palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic intelligent psychopath the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific while widmark as he often did pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level most of the time br br somebody should remake this no supernaturals no mysticism no special fx just a good yarn full of character conflict and a topical theme another reviewer mentioned the writer john kennedy o'toole and that's spot on with the number of oddball new orleans types peppering this dark sleazy against the clock drama there's even a midget newspaper seller br br community what community d'you think you're living in the middle ages,1
this type of plot really does have a lot of potential but it was butchered here honestly i sensed the cheese element in the beginning but i thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing whoa i was wrong so mad scientist makes a monster wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them but of course they escape after that it's really bad i should've counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage but i most likely would have lost count br br pan down to the blood dripping from severed leg to show us how the shark man finds the folks i hate being spoon fed every aspect of a horror film br br oh and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark man and trudging around a jungle esqe island there's nothing more cheerful than a middle aged man reciting shakespeare br br this is one where you'll find yourself rooting for the monster if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick,0
this movie is supposed to be taking place in and around seattle the why is porteau cove p r o v i n c i a l park shown provincial parks are in canada and not the united states the inspector uses a palm pilot complete with stylus to 'read' that someone has hacked into the computer of the bridal shop i did not know that this was possible using a database storage device a woman appears in the movie without any introduction and is never introduced we learn half way into the movie that this woman works in the district attorney's office then in the correctional center a guard actually precedes jenks through a door and keeps his back to the offender this would never happen in a real correctional setting the director really messed on this one this doesn't happen in real life the acting is adequate the plot is good the cinematography is good however the many errors found in the continuity lead to a 3 out of 10 vote,0
just the ultimate masterpiece in my opinion every line every phrase every picture is exactly in place and lindsay crouse and joe mantegna are just the cool shrink and the sleazy con man so well cast 10 out of 10,1
i am glad to see most other people here don't think much of this movie either it has some big names in the cast but that's it there is nothing else to recommend save ogling a few pretty women which you can do in a thousand films br br the story involves nothing but unlikable self centered chain smoking hip characters that national film critics all seem to like and most of the public can't stand br br the oklahoma accents are so fake they are laughable the southern racist stereotypes are right from liberal hollywood 101 and the story is depressing,0
silly movie is really really funny yes it's got its dead moments it can be a bit too obvious it declines a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess but it's laugh out loud funny all the way and it's worth seeing just for ed mcmahon as a right wing kook this movie is in the same class as elvira mistress of the dark another incredibly funny underappreciated film,1
the plot of this film is not strong at all lots of holes if you approach it as a car movie its not bad lots of great cars in this one the reason i like it is because i am from the area where this was filmed i get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in st cloud mn and seeing how the town has changed since 89 its an interesting historical piece for us locals seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it it is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it came out on vhs had to get a copy from japan on ebay i find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town i didn't know the director was from st cloud,0
as a fan of the sookie stackhouse books i find this series to be a totally crass representation of them vampire bill is not very good looking and looks much older than described in the book i found that they have made already wonderfully colourful characters seem very course and vulgar one of the things i loved about the books is that despite all the crap that she is going through sookie is always a lady and yet in the tv series she doesn't seem like that at all not only that but the prejudices displayed in the tv series are not nearly as wide spread in the books i didn't expect an exact replica of the books but i at least expected the feel of them to be used for the series,0
james stewart plays an fbi agent who began working with the agency before it was called the fbi and the story involves dealing with the ku klux klan the prohibition era gangsters world war ii german and japanese spies etc a continuously interesting picture covering 40 years of history far superior to any films being made these days br br of special interest to older viewers familiar with washington dc in a scene about 20 minutes into the movie where james stewart finds out from vera miles that she's expecting their first child the scene was filmed in herzog's seafood restaurant on the former washington waterfront the only movie in which this historic location appears shortly after taking office president kennedy decided that southwest washington a 99 black neighborhood was an eyesore and ought to be torn down by decree befitting his position of undisputed royalty the entire area including the popular waterfront restaurant district but excluding 3 historic churches was reduced to rubble black residents evicted from their homes relocated as best they could and without federal assistance likewise businesses were simply put out of business few re locating restaurant row was converted into a sidewalk and washington had no waterfront restaurants seafood stands boats etc for about 10 years as a lifetime resident the herzog restaurant scene was our 1 reason to see this fine movie again,1
this movie starts presenting a somehow original idea but became a great frustration later on what is the deal of having an original start if the rest of the movie did little to avoid a clichéd plot the movie itself is very unbelievable i would like to know how exactly someone enters a clinic gets a nurse outfit kills a doctor takes out a patient in her bed puts into his chevy pickup and leaves i guess no one could answer this question so they just jumped to the other scene hiding these little details the performances are just plain bad the villain is just another annoying crazy antagonist no deepness totally linear character after 20 minutes of film most scenes are unbelievable seemed like they were put there just for the sake of the 90 minutes since they were totally unneeded a doctor see a woman clearly under strong medication is denied to examine her gets kicked out of the house and simply leaves quiet the ending scene made me burst into laugher only mickey mouse could make it more out of reality i'm giving it 2 out of 10 for the first lets say 10 minutes of movie,0
the character acting is a little stiff as if it is the first time man of the actors have appeared on screen unfortunately one of the better actresses jean simmons played many bit roles on tv like in star trek tng and in the heat of the night dies quickly and thereafter her acting can be markedly missed br br the lead role is mr ballard as portrayed by cliff robertson cliff is forced to carry this movie with his body language for most of the time he doesn't do a poor job but it is a little overmuch to ask of an actor to plug the oceans of blank screen time during which the characters spend their time not talking and also not acting robertson's most memorable role may have been ben parker in the last 3 spider man movies starring tobey maguire br br the plot is predictable a husband murders his rich wife for her money thereafter the wife seems to comeback and haunt the husband driving him insane until he leaps from a high window fearing the specter of his dead wife approaching him on the day he is predicted to die no less br br the second chauffeur mr ballard hires looks a lot like an english mark hamill uncanny really the only thing that stands out is the utter disregard for dialogue many minutes pass in quietness no one speaks and few act it is a shame the mst3k guys never got hold of this movie it could have been much better if not just as predictable with more dialogue or shorter scenes of 'nothingness' br br i kept expecting g'mork's red eyes to appear from the shadows and proclaim that he works for the nothing that inhabits this film,0
having read many of the other reviews for this film on the imdb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based upon this point i cannot comment having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously however what i can say with certainty is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass let's be honest here this film is just so much fun br br ok so i must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character s but let's put this into a clear perspective do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960's batman series does not remain faithful to the original dc comic book character or perhaps is there still unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of flash gordon was too much of a departure from the original series br br the point is yes this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm br br former tarzan ron ely plays the eponymous hero in this and bears more than a passing resemblance to gary busey to boot and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite michael berryman br br best scene far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke lemonade and milk at a formal occasion also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein savage tackles his nemesis captain seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen  priceless br br simply put the film doesn't take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it great fun from start to finish and you'll be singing the john phillip sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed,1
this is indeed a funny show done in a creepy sort of way much like a tim burton film it's worth a look as it's far more creative than most of the shows this season best of all it's not a reality show i'm wondering why the viewing public is so ready to accept shows like that which lack creativity and ignore wonderful shows like this that actually have a creative bent br br while some decry the premise i think it's really unusual much more enjoyable than ghost whisperer and medium i think it's the funniest thing on the tube since my name is earl br br oh and the narration and music are wonderful if you enjoy shows that are a bit off the beaten path i'd recommend it it's not as strange as twin peaks was but it's got a serious kink to it,1
this is an entertaining movie actually might make you uncomfortable since it isn't some undead psychopath or sociopath its your everyday doctor how scary is that got some good actors and actresses in this movie though some where unappreciated like virginya keehne as sarah ken foree who you might recognize from rob zombie's devils rejects and halloween 2007 co stars as our detective on schizoid dr alan feinstone's corbin benson trail short little summary is this dr alan feinstone a guy who has a sexy wife nice house and is a great dentist everyone loves until he catches his wife cheating on him with the pool cleaner then he starts having hallucinations that his patients' teeth are all rotted and that the female patients are his wife as he starts going nuts in this thriller but before that nice guy,1
despite the title the sword bearer and the dvd cover action herioc poses of the sword bearer this is not a super hero film br br minor spoilers it follows the tale of sasha the sword bearer who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm cool you say but no this is real life if you had this power as a child could you control it when say faced by a mad man or when your mum's boyfriend is beating her and if you don't control it how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12 br br this essentially is where sasha is when we meet him wandering aimlessly after another killing much like a bout de soufflé he then meet katya and the pair fall instantly in love providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways however his past is still chasing him in the form of two police officers br br that is essentially the story and there is virtually no action on screen though a lot if suggested br br i really like this movie unlike many hollywood 'super hero' films we get very little back story there is no bad guy unless you count the sword bearer himself abut there is a lot of heart and good character development br br worth checking out if you can find it,1
an intriguing premise of hand drawn fantasy come to life in a child's fever dreams however i imagine the average nonfictional child is far more adept at scaring themselves than bernard rose is at riveting the viewer the duel between anna's two realities drags on far too long to sustain interest especially considering that the little girl playing her is the most abrasive child actor i've ever seen br br use only for kindling,0
yes it's another great magical muppet's movie and i adore them all the characters the movies the tv show episodes it's the best comedy or musical tv show ever and all the artists behind it but here they did such a rare fatal mistake and i'm surely talking about the weird ending br br i think it's very dangerous to involve that much in american drama and end a love affair by marriage we as all the poor viewers feel so free or maybe happy for the absence of its annoyance peevishness and misery so we all enjoy these stories which gather 2 cute heroes as couple in love without the legitimate bond like mickey mouse and minnie superman and lois lane dick tracy and tess etc so with all of the previous couples and their likes i bet that you feel safe serenity and peace therefore when you look at what the makers of this movie had already done you'll be as mad as me br br they made the weak miserable creature kermit marry his daily nightmare the most vexatious female ever miss piggy this is a historical change by the measures of the american entertainment's industry and it was pretty normal to have a negative impact upon the audience whom just refused to bless or believe or being satisfied with that sudden marriage even the pathetic frog didn't have the time or the proper opportunity to think or to decide anything therefore no wonder at all when you know that this movie is the most failure one in their cinematic serious grossing only 25 millions vis à vis 65 millions earned by the first one the muppet movie  1979 five years earlier br br simply in this movie they took manhattan and my rest too,1
can a pix ever ever ever do anything right this movie was meant to be seen on tv in a letterbox format since a pix doesn't even believe in pan and scan we see whole scenes where a shoulder on the left side of the screen talks to a shoulder on the right side of course not that you are missing much this movie is incredibly bad it's very hard to enjoy a film where characters are screaming at the top of their lungs during 80 of the movie for no reason,0
a surprisingly effective thriller this br br david duchovny and michelle 'ensign ro' forbes are a successful professional couple he a writer she a photographer forbes is desperate to move to california and in an act of compromise mulder agrees to the move on the condition that along the way they visit sites of historical interest concerning famous serial killers his idea he writes the words she takes the pictures with the end result a bestselling coffee table book that will set them up for life to help finance the trip they decide to car share and advertise the fact as their bad luck would have it brad pitt sees the advert and shortly after killing his landlord he and his girlfriend juliette lewis meet the writer couple and begin their cross country trek inevitably mischief ensues br br pitt is outstanding as the genuinely chill inspiring early grayce and is capably backed up by lewis playing her customary white trash character that seems to be her default setting duchovny and forbes make for a convincing double act too and as events spiral out of control you as the viewer are sucked into their plight and can feel the tension ratcheting br br intelligent sinister and beautifully shot this deserves recognition beyond its current status a top movie,1
it came by surprise the impact resoloution this film had on my automatic way of being reactive to people situations most vividly was the stirring of the emotion anger much like the way a spoiled child would be when reacting to not getting their way a temper tantrum if you will thinking i was hiding this anger from others was the most ridiculous farce of all what was this costing me soooo much love sooo many blessings now i'm present to how incredible humbling myself feels and having an ongoing attitude of gratitude for life for what is happening in the moment without my wild expectations for life to be a particular way the way i think life or people should be this film has contributed to the freedom i now feel to connect with others without limits expectations and to connect with genuine love without fear of loss just to love first and accept what love is given,1
i have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i don't know how i sat through an hour of it i must have been in a coma that night i saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago i couldn't even remember the name but i knew that penelope ann miller starred in it it must have really affected me to be wasting my time commenting on it today yech vomit barf,0
i am a huge fan of the comic book series but this movie fell way below my expectations i expected a heavy metal 2000 kinda feel to it slow moving bad dialogue lots o' blood but this was worse than anything i could have imagined br br the plot line is almost the same as the comic but the good points pretty much stop there the characters don't have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series the movie only covers a small portion of the comic and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts the focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic book br br with the right people working on this project it could have been amazing sadly it wasn't that way so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love my copy will surely collect dust for years until i finally throw it out,0
honestly i don't know what's funnier this horrific remake or the comments on this board masterpiece's review had me in tears that's so funny anyway this movie is the among the worst movies ever and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels the omen name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on hbo but it's a slap in the face to the other three especially the original there are so many classically bad moments but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic fair good times this movie is to the omen series what scary movie is to the entire genre avoid unless you're looking for a good laugh,0
with a title like attack of the killer tomatoes anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a a bad science fiction movie or b a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies it's supposed to be a mix of both with a dose of parody splashed in unfortunately it falls flat very soon br br you're never supposed to take this movie seriously i realize that but you're supposed to think it's funny right i found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny i e the side by side phone conversations the russian olympic spy eating steroid cereal superman walking by lois etc attack of the killer tomatoes strives to be a cult classic but it doesn't make it a cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it or a similar description attack of the killer tomatoes could be enjoyed by any 8 year old with a bad sense of humor so therefore it does not qualify as a cult film br br there is one good actress in the entire thing sharon taylor as lois fairchild she is a thin gawky reporter but has an endearing personality loves to overact and is a natural comedienne unfortunately she is put to bad use here br br attack of the killer tomatoes is not as funny as say amazon women on the moon or kentucky fried movie but it does have a few hilarious moments so i would still recommend seeing it once avoid the director's cut it has interruptions by the producer of the movie and some supposedly lost footage dubbed in a pretend african dialect it can be found in english on the out of print tape,0

i just saw this film last night in the 2006 tribeca film festival and it seriously makes me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the films before selecting them the film was simply awful i say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives it was awful matthew modine's days as a leading man are way over gina gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary english accent she should be ashamed of her participation in this film gloria reuben had a weird little cameo in it she should also be ashamed the script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters i highly doubt this will be picked up but then again people in hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes i really think kettle of fish is a serious contender for the worst movie i've ever seen,0
of course he did have to invent everything about cinematography film directing etc before he could make classics like the gardner so i suppose he may be forgiven this initial excursion into mere sociological documentary today we call them home movies and they are just as boring now as this one is,1
look although we don't like to admit it we've all have to suppress our fears concerning the extreme likelihood of experiencing the events that take place in this movie you know you get into your car and you immediately start thinking gosh i hope today isn't the day that my accelerator sticks at a comfortable cruising speed of 55 mph all four door latches break in the locked position both my main and emergency brake fail my ignition switch can't be turned off and i've got a full tank of gas all simultaneously fortunately for most of us our thorazine kicks in before we actually decide that it's a bad idea to be driving a car not so for the makers of the harrowing white knuckle edge of your seat if only in preparation to leave the room action juggernaut runaway car but they go ahead and drive anyway br br i am endlessly pleased to have found thanks to the imdb that this movie is real and that i didn't merely dream it br br this movie is at the very least one of the fantastic sights you will see on your journey to find the el dorado of very bad cinema br br i highly recommend it,1
the movie was gripping from start to finish and its b w photography of the american heartland is stunning we feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into mexico and back to america again near the end of the movie the reflection of the rain on robert blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face in the end we follow them up the stairway to their final moment br br the two criminals performed by robert blake and scott wilson as perry smith and dick hickock could be seen on any street in any town hickock is a smiling boy next door and smith the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town this point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else evil even the most vile is part of the human condition these two delusional men kill an entire family looking for a safe that isn't there once on the run they start writing bad cheques carving out a trail for the authorities br br there are many fine supporting actors i like john forsyth as the detective on the case alvin dewey also will geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorney br br i have often wanted to see this movie all the way through having only caught it in short snatches i did finally get to it after buying the dvd the result is the finest classic crime movie i have ever seen br br don't miss this brilliant movie to me this is what great film making is all about,1
the sunshine boys is one of my favorite feel good movies i first saw it when it as the christmas attraction at radio city music hall when it first came out and loved it ever since i ended up seeing it 6 times in the theaters and if it was playing today i'd go out to see it again br br now a lot of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads matthau was brilliant but had the misfortune of being nominated against jack nicholson's oscar winning performance of randall p macmurphy in one flew over the cuckoo's nest burns did win though richard benjiman deserved at least to be nominated as well even the smallest roles were played to perfection like fritz feld auditioning for the potato chips commercial br br which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film the direction of the greatly underrated herbert ross ross who previously brought a two person play the owl and the pussycat to the screen and made a full movie out of it does it again he opens the plays out without making them look like a photographic stage play he fleashens out the story and the characters br br here we're 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play where ben clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special though there are dialogue from the play during the first twenty minutes the sequence itself is totally new a few years ago i did see at the broadway revival of the play with jack klugman and tony randall which was wonderful but i think that ross and screenwriter playwright simon improved on it it's just a wonderful film,1
a bugs life is a great film that is not just for kids but for adults too the story is set around a colony of ants and their struggle against the evil grasshoppers who come back every year and steal their food a mirror of the magnifiscent seven there is some wonderfull computer animation and the voices are great too you will love it 8 out of 10,1
i'm watching this on the star world network overseas which buys american and canadian series that last one or two seasons like the jane show i thought of how many female lead comedy shows im actually able to watch on my own there's lucy bewitched i dream of jeanie the one with barbara feldman and then my mind goes kind of blank i cannot think of any others the women are all supporting roles not the lead so for me the jane show is in pretty good company one thing i just thought of though i've watched several things made in canada and i never recall any thing being filmed in a regular tv series that shows snow it's all made at the height of summer lol granted it's a great place to live climate wise in the summer but you would think they would show a little bit of canada in the winter since that's part of the lifestyle there also i mean sctv just for laughs come to mind as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in canada and very little or none is shot with snow present even though they both do a lot of outdoor shots i digress but i kind of chuckle at jane and her obviously liberal ways being accused of racism to her neighbor and i like the bald guy and his craziness i found it on par with a uk series called the it crowd i think another office comedy with a female lead not by any means the best comedy ever but for a guy to say he can watch it alone thats saying something if i was with my wife she might really enjoy it since it addresses sex in the office and stuff like that so might be a good light comedy for couples to watch 7 of 10,1
baby face is a fast paced wise cracking knowing smirk of a film that br br lasts only an hour and 15 minutes but oh what a smart 75 minutes they br br are that a story that covers so much ground could be told in such a br br short time puts most of today's movie makers to shame screenwriters of br br today should study the economy of baby face and cut the bloat that br br overwhelms so many of their films br br the story is no nonsense an amoral woman rises to wealth first under br br and then over the bodies of the men who fall madly in love with her br br sure the production code loused it up with a redeeming happy ending br br but it isn't hard to see in which the direction the writers wanted to br br go so enjoy what's there and use your imagination for the rest stanwyck is terrific as is george brent and douglass dumbvrille as a br br hapless suitor not a great film but certainly an enjoyable one if br br you've never seen baby face catch it the next time it's shown on cable br br or rent the cassette it's worth the effort,1
this is the kind of movie that's so extremely bad that you cant stop watching it because you keep telling yourself that 'it cannot continue to be this crappy all the way to the end it just cant' you know 'worse than jaws 4' kind of bad br br i honestly think i've only seen one movie that was worse than this and then we're talking religious crap about how you'd end up in hell for lying or watching football br br gore indeed and lots of it well made gore no way br br the acting is beyond bad and all the lines are lousy clichés same goes for the storyline which only really consist of sex blood and violence like so many other gore movies br br if you're hoping for a mix between ichi the killer and august underground keep looking you wont find it in live feed,0
watching that lady in ermine i was wondering what betty grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for marlene dietrich to do someone over at 20th century fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another darryl f zanuck should have known better br br betty plays a 19th century italian countess whose domain has been invaded by a troop of hungarian hussars captained by douglas fairbanks jr her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree sees no small resemblance in doug now and another invader some 300 years earlier whom she dealt with when armies failed br br besides that the current betty has just been married to cesar romero and the invasion has come at a most inopportune moment before things have been consummated that's going to give anyone a bad attitude i guarantee br br fresh wholesome all american betty is not the actress to do seductive and mysterious marlene dietrich might have put this over but with betty it falls flatter than yesterday's presidential candidate she and fairbanks have no chemistry at all though doug is as charming as ever and someone i can watch in anything br br frederick hollander and leo robin wrote the score for this film and this is the moment got an oscar nomination for best song that lady in ermine's one chance for oscar glory fell to buttons and bows br br ernest lubitsch died midway during the film and otto preminger finished that lady in ermine i can't believe lubitsch had grable in mind for the lead here neither will you if you see that lady in ermine,0
vic richard dreyfuss is a mob boss leaving a mental institution back to his world of gangsters how can a director have a cast with richard dreyfuss ellen barkin jeff goldblum diane lane very gorgeous gabriel byrne gregory hines kyle maclachlan burt reynolds billy idol and a make such a waste of time this movie is a comedy that is not funny having a constellation in the cast my vote is four br br title brazil ' prazer em matar te ' 'pleasure in killing you ' br br,0
to me movies and acting is all about telling a story the story of david and bethsheba is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account in this movie i thought the storytelling by gregory peck and susan hayward were at their best to know and understand the story of david and his journey to become the king of israel made this story all the more compelling you could feel his lust for a beautiful woman gregory peck showed the real human side of this man who in his time was larger than life susan hayward's fear reluctance but then obedience to his authority as her king was beautifully portrayed by her one could also feel david's anguish the nigh that uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home as well as the sadness when he was killed in battle raymond massey's powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel his anger the sets were real enough and the atmosphere believable all in all i think this was one of the best movies of it's kind i gave it a rating of ten,1
just too many incidents of violence br br the film goes from one scene to another and in nearly every one violence erupts br br now i am not one who is shocked by violence and to me a film without a fight in it has something missing but please not one after another my reaction was not shock or horror it was here we go again there is some semblance of a story in between the scenes of violence but two thirds of the way through the film i had switched off completely and couldn't wait for the end br br if this is the best the film makers can do they should find something else to do with their miserable lives like making shoes or delivering mail,0
this movie is an embarrassment to film making i can't believe it was even listed as a comedy not funny not only was the script atrocious but the casting people should be shot gail o'grady is just a great actress but beyond that 99 of the rest of the cast ouch pretty much everyone else wow it is hard to even wow here is the number one rule about comedy don't try to be funny there are a lot of very talented actors in canada who can do drama and comedy none of them were used in this film canadian nepotism and casting directors are helping to perpetuate bad film making in canada i realize this is technically a us film but look at the director actors location etc i just saw this on bravo they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this film again there are a lot of great films out there that can't get airtime and they show this crap,0
first of all i am a huge fan of madeleine l'engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books a wrinkle in time this movie however ruined that excitement for me i am sorry but meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool in the movie she has straight hair and no glasses and is the sporty type with a deep voice this is not how madeleine l'engle pictured meg to be at all in fact meg was based on madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young this is just one major example how the book and movie are different so i would say if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes watch it but if you are a devoted fan of madeleine l'engle and her wrinkle in time series i would suggest skipping this movie,0
this movie is about human relationships charming funny and well written with meaningful text it seems that morgan freeman surely have fun at the set also good music paz vega is a beautiful and smart woman i really enjoy her acting woman like her are a good motivation to learn spanish language from the moment morgan freeman meets the cute paz vega the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to care about where their lives are headed 10 items or less is about zest of life if you enjoy this film see also the pursuit of happiness with will smith and his son thats not a action film or a nude comedy its all about human relations,1
the synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect it's a very good thriller well shot tough to believe it was bill paxton's directorial debut though some shots do look exactly like a storyboard version br br still there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of paxton br br it's a solid story with some great twists at the end several of them all believable all fun and best of all obscured well enough to make them true twists br br the child actors in the movie do a great too i'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as nickelodeon rejects but both these kids do a good job br br this movie is not gory it's not very scary but it is very very creepy,1
there is so much to love in this darling little comedy anyone who has ever built or bought a house or even just been short of space will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled mr blanding melvyn douglas with great comedic flare both narrates and acts as the blandings' attorney and voice of reason as well myrna loy is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife but the best performance is grant's he is the american everyman especially relevant at the time of this film's release when the nation was in the grips of a housing shortage after the end of the war the themes are universal lack of money work strain fear of infidelity yes it does wrap up awfully neatly but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war and wanted a happy ending it is still relevant today and i must chalk up the poor reviews i see to a present preference for dumbed down gross out comedies the look of the film is slick and there are some great bits of comedy is well particularly toward the beginning while it may have lost some of it's social relevance nearly sixty years after it's release it is still a gem,1
victor mclaglen the title character of john ford's the informer reminded me of the circus man from fellini's la strada anthony quinn played the brutish man who may have even been influenced by the pug faced oscar winning performance given by mclaglen poverty stricken dublin is the true life atmospheric setting of the picture which takes place in 1922 dense fog and a long damp night are the main elements of a story about deep irish patriotism and the fight of the irish republican army the conflict of individuality and the cause is what makes the informer tick mclaglen's large simple character just wants to go to america and we're reminded by signs of the price for a ticket frequently two different signs become the psychological centerpiece for the drunken irishman one is the previous the other a wanted sign should he do it and get the money to go br br john ford once famously said my name is ford i make westerns after seeing this film he obviously could do a heck of a lot more the serious social issues dealt with here are heartfelt and ones you will find yourself thinking about and the look of the piece is amazing consisting of long dark shadows cutting into a miserable ireland night ford was always known for his luminescent gorgeous cinematography that helped to foresee the conflicts within his characters this is hard in color but he did it in pictures like the searchers painting john wayne in a sometimes vicious manner victor mclaglen's performance not only benefits from the lighting but by the sheer simplicity of his acting he shoves a lot he knocks people out he is a brute who knows no better he should however know whether or not to cross the ira br br see the film to find out the gritty details see it also for mclaglen and ford's patriotic portrayal of the ira max steiner's score is innovative in how it matches gestures of the characters placing more emphasis on them this was usually only seen in silent films especially chaplin the topic of naming names or informing is obviously still important just look at how the media covered this year's oscars giving much attention to the elia kazan scandal,1
this movie is despite its independent status a stupid hollywood version of a nauseating mother daughter relationship it wasnt that bad at first but somewhere during the course of the movie around the time that the daughter goes out with that guy i think it turns into a cheesey mother daughter bonding movie im sorry but i dont know of any mothers who have that kind of relationship with their daughter its probably better that way though,0
i really enjoyed this episode which was a great surprise given the bad reputation it seems to have acquired from a pure writing perspective 'the 16mm shrine' is an absolute treat with fantastic dialogue and character analysis typical of sterling in particular i really enjoyed the philosophical indulgences of the episode tackling themes of existence and reality whilst balancing it with more psychological topics such as denial pride and desire 'the sixteen millimeter shrine' is an episode about how these ideas based around an unwillingness to accept change can seemingly alienate a person from the rest of the ever changing world it is also a fantastic example of cerebral twilight zone one that explores the mind rather than the world outside it these elements all come together very nicely to create a thought provoking and incredibly interesting 25 minutes br br the episode is not without its faults however which mainly lay in lupino and leisen shoes ironically i felt lupino was unconvincing throughout with only a few scenes that could count as memorable this of course being an absolute shame considering how well sterling had written her character furthermore leisen didn't seem to know what to do with most of his characters sometimes having them stand around on set doing next to nothing which probably explains why accepted the poor performances from lupino half the time thankfully balsam does a good job of covering up a lot of weak spots helping redeem the show from an acting perspective at least br br as i said previously however if you're a fan of classic film and cerebral science fiction this shouldn't be as bad as it's sometimes made out to be in addition to the writing that i mentioned above the episode also features some fantastic photography it still amazes me that the show looks this good nearly fifty years later and decent enough set design overall 'the sixteen millimeter shrine is a great episode and above all is certainly one to make you think,1
ok so i just saw the movie although it appeared last year i thought that it was generally a decent movie except for the storyline which was stupid and horrible first of all we never get to know anything about the creatures why they appeared wtf are they doing in our world and really have they been on earth before we were or did they just come from space secondly the role of the butcher to maintain order is just so obviously created really how large could the underground for a sub station could have been there were only so many of those creatures so i think instead of killing innocent people in vain they could have just planted some tactical bombs or maybe clear the are and a nuke would have done the job i know it sounds funny and it is but i do not see the killing of people as being necessary thirdly leon acts like superman jumping on the train and fighting vinnie jones who was way taller and bigger in stature then again when he faces the conductor he does nothing and acts as a wimp watching all the abominations i mean ok the conductor had creepy help lol but if leon was so brave he would have gone all the way i mean he risks his life first then does nothing exactly when he should have he could have died as a hero but lives as a coward this might be the case but not after showing so much braveness earlier on then the cop thing come on this was a city having a subway i bet there must have been other cops except that lady other police stations this was really kind of silly all in all great acting by vinnie jones interesting idea up to the reason behind it which is not really built at all by the way what did the signs on the chest mean vinnie jones cannot make up for the rest,0
must every good story be improved with added corny broadway music apparently those who can't come up with their own plots think that classic literature is just there for the plundering i confess that oliver twist and similar stories are not my favorites as it is certainly true that dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out and this was a great example of just that so of course take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from prancing orphan boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly it's uplifting argh fetch me a basin br br the four stars in my rating come from casting which i could liken to that of my fair lady each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of but then they must go and have them sing see complaint above unlike my fair lady those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of oliver reed pardon if i'm mistaken it's been a while br br my biggest complaint i've stated why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story seldom has this been done to good effect generally it ruins the story it did with this one jury's still out on whether this story is worth saving but with all that gadding about it's impossible to tell,0
this is the kind of movie hollywood needs to make more of no extravagant props no car chases no clever one liners just people dealing with being people br br william macy plays an unlikely hitman who works for his father donald sutherland macy is the dutiful son sutherland is the domineering father son wants out of the business father won't let him macy loves his own son played beautifully by david dorfman the ring he also starts to fall in love with neve campbell a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist's office br br it's an interesting juxtaposition of characters and the film follows the reluctant killer as he balances his own needs with those of his family there are many touching scenes especially between macy and his little boy and as you'd expect in a film with william macy in it there's a bit of humor too br br excellent job all around actors and director nice to know they can still make a good film in hollywood on a small budget,1
peter o'toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken stupor the lovely susannah york provides a good foil for o'toole's dramatic presence br br the film alludes to incest without a single explicit scene but it is able to entertain the viewer in its raucous social commentary though this is not major film by any reckoning it will be remembered for its entertaining performances br br even york signing the papers at the end is a treat to watch exuding tragedy silently the possible weakness here is thompson's laid back direction but the film floats because of the actors and the script br br i saw the film twice over a period of 20 years on both occasions with the name brotherly love country dance is a rather farcical and inappropriate title for this movie wherever it was released as such,1
the movie was ok not bad not good just ok if there was anything else in the theater this would be skipped by far sadly fast and furious 2 also stunk but i'd rather see this than ff2 if you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk this will be a cute movie for you personally i'd wait for hbo or blockbuster,0
kristine watts molie weeks is broken apart missing her lover she is not able to overcome her love for him that is lost in the past she hires a stranger douglas davis and gives a list of her mistakes to him with things to fix but time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for the pain is a tragic end br br the first point that impresses in the cure is the stylish cinematography that alternates black and white with color the concise and sharp screenplay is capable to develop a tragic and bleak tale of love with an unexpected plot point in the very end in less than eight minutes the soundtrack is beautiful but the volume is a little loud and associated to the fact that english is not my native language in some moments i needed to repeat some words whispered by the narrator the unknown lead actress has magnificent performance and is extremely gorgeous i hope to have a chance to see her again on the screen last but not the least the debut of the director and writer ryan jafri could not be better my vote is nine br br title brazil not available,1
this film was so amateurish i could hardly believe what i was seeing it is shot on video not film i have not seen the likes of this since the early 70's when late night networks showed movie of the week 'horror flicks' shot in video it looks like a bad soap opera and that is paying it a compliment some of the actors give it their best shot michael des barres does okay with what he is given to do which is to act like a sex addict out of control i can't say that it is pleasant to watch br br nastassja kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film with very little variation in camera angles i can't fault her for someone else's poor blocking but she is totally unbelievable in her role her little girl voice works against her here and i consider myself a nastassja kinski fan she is certainly ageless and exotic but she's outside her range with this br br alexandra paul is pathetically overwrought every line she delivers is with three exclamation points someone must have directed her to scream at all costs why would michael des barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew br br finally rosanna arquette as the sweet maligned wife comes off okay and probably the most believable of the bunch but that is not saying much br br this has to be the worst film i have seen in years,0
certainly one of the finest movies i have seen for quite some time exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film denzel washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date and the rest of the cast perform beautifully christopher walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as i would have liked a story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love this is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets rockets and revenge the location of mexico city adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener all in all a truly gripping film from beginning to end highly recommended,1
with such actors as ralph richardson raymond massey cedrick hardwicke and margaretta scott how can you go wrong very unusual scenics especially the modern ones the realization of the modern machinery is very effective here you have ray gun blasts from building vehicles that help clear the area so new structures can be made although she's much younger in this film it's not very hard to figure out who the future mrs pumphrey from the bbc series all creatures great and small is going to be really effective reappearance of both raymond massey and ralph richardson the musical score is by the renowned swiss composer artur honegger and it is also unusual for the time 1936 it looks like they used really large sets or the effects make it seem that way lastly it's a really good story,1
while i totally disagree with one reviewer who described charley chase as unfunny in this film he certainly is it's a shame as i suspect the other reviewer must have only seen a few charley chase duds and assumed the guy wasn't funny films like mighty like a moose and what price goofy are very good chase films so he could be really funny given good material unfortunately in this film he's given absolutely nothing even the inclusion of the usually good oliver hardy as a foil isn't any help because the basic premise boy wants to marry girl but girl's father thinks the boy is a wuss and the gags are so poor it's a shame as i really wanted to love this film but couldn't br br by the way for those used to the look for charley from the mid 1920s on you'll be pretty surprised as chase sports no glasses or mustache and looks very little like you'd expect,0
it started out with an interesting premise i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies the more the film progressed the more i realized that this was a b movie at best in the latter half it quickly became a c movie then d then f then i wish that this wasn't a rental so that i could put it in the microwave i can't say that the acting in all cases was awful just most the writing however i never read the book maybe the book is well written the screenplay was written by a 10 year old it was ridiculously shallow the dialog drab and uninteresting the characters about as interesting as a 5 pound bag of fertilizer i really hated this movie as did my wife i am a christian and i have no problem with movies that promote or support christianity this movie did a great disservice to the cause awful terrible worthless if you liked it i strongly recommend superman 4,0
let's begin with that theme song sung by christopher cross the song is if you get caught between the moon and new york city it's a great theme and song even after all these years it never gets tiring it really is a great song about new york city as well anyway the great dudley moore cbe stars as a spoiled drunken millionaire who is engaged to jill eikenberry's character in the film jill would later star on la law anyway he is served by his wonderful british butler sir john gielgud om who won an academy award for his performance in the film as best supporting actor arthur falls in love with liza minnelli's character who is perfect in this film besides her performance in her oscar winning role in cabaret no liza doesn't get to sing she plays a diner waitress anyway i love geraldine fitzgerald as the bach matriarch of the family who decides the family's fortune anyway she is fabulous and should have gotten an academy award nomination herself for best supporting actress barney martin best known as jerry's dad on seinfeld plays liza's dad he's great too the movie was well written acted and delivered to the audience who wanted more of it,1
bad bad bad bad bad what else can i say kate jackson must have been desperate to direct may be she should go back to acting on second thought she was a bad actress to who would put money in to producing something this bad i like anti christ movies and usually have a good laugh and the odd scare but this one is just bad bad bad the acting by the stars was worse than what you find on a soap opera the special effects if you can call them that where laughable i would not be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion you would see the tubes the blood shoots out of we had to turn the disc off after only 30 minutes this so called movies original prints should be destroyed all disc' and tapes destroyed and all the people associated with the making of the movie have to pay back money to the people that rented the movie then those people should never be allowed to act direct or film any thing but their own home movies,0
i had high hopes for this film because i thought clean shaven kerrigan's first feature was absolutely terrific the most assuredly cinematic low budget film i'd ever seen br br but much of claire dolan is utterly pointless and flat scene after scene seems randomly tossed into the mix without much thought for narrative or character br br is claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not hard to tell why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in seattle why do we have to see her dye her hair to what is virtually the exact same color why does claire accept some johns and not others the filmmaker doesn't seem to know br br it feels as if everything is improvised though i understand this wasn't the case and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a verite documentary br br after the screening i saw kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narrative as politically conservative it sounded like learned rhetoric i think it was a cop out br br i am saddened that the maker of a film as exciting as clean shaven would go on to make such a lame film as this one and then defend it with tired old political cliches,0
and this is a very disturbing film i may be wrong but this is the last film where i considered burt reynolds an actual actor who transformed the role and delivered a message br br jon voight and ned beatty are also excellent they are unassuming and unaware businessmen wanting to enjoy the country little did they know what would happen next br br the photography and sets are realistic and natural this was before the days of wes craven br br what is most disturbing about this film is the fact that places like this still exist in america country folk still detest city people it is almost a century and a half since the civil war br br you will enjoy this film it was filmed in the rural sections of south georgia which still exist just don't drive past that to mobile alabama that area still has not been repaired since hurricane katrina 10 10,1
sad story of a downed b 17 pilot brady is shot down over occupied territory the local ranchers extended him kindness and protection at the cost of their own lives i had never heard of this movie and it snagged me for two hours after the film is over i'm glad i took the time it's an entire story told to explain the look on brady's face at the start of the film,1
yesterday my spanish catalan wife and myself saw this emotional lesson in history spain is going into the direction of political confrontation again that is why this masterpiece should be shown in all spanish high schools it is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism the american pilot who gets involved in the spanish civil war chooses for the democratically elected republican government the criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that uribe ever made the colors are magnificent the cruelty of a war could anybody tell me the difference between any war and a civil war is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other the cowards that start their abuse of power even towards innocent children are now active again a film like 'el viaje de carol' 'carol's journey' tells one of the so many sad stories of the 20th century it is a better lesson in history than any book could contain again great work from the peninsula iberica,1
this is just about in the same league as the black cat' although i'd give this a 9 rather than a 9 that's praise indeed for a film that has been so badly underrated that it is amazing br br the invisible ray' is part horror part drama and certainly part sci fi for a movie made in 1936 the sci fi elements were a good deal ahead of their time the mixture of horror drama and sci fi are a perfect blend while the acting on the part of lugosi and karloff couldn't be better br br director lambert hillyer captures a lot of elements that james whale did so often what i'm saying is that this film is eerie and well shot the scene with the gargoyles outside of lugosi's room is a perfect example of the mood it's a standout moment in the film which is so sadly missing in today's movies of the genre br br as with the black cat' and island of lost souls' i can't understand why this film has yet to be released on dvd when you consider some of the junk that's already been transferred to dvd it's that much more puzzling br br anyway watch this film if you get the chance when it's released on dvd grab it fast and put it in an honored spot within your dvd library,1
starring an unknown cast which seem likely to remain that way this film is yet another cheap slasher flick which amazes me how this was released i have no problem with horrors and slasher flicks in particular in fact they are my favourites but when they are done this bad it really does take the monkey and its no wonder the genre has such a hard time the story is as clichéd and without imagination as possible with a bunch of people in a cabin out in the woods being slashed and hacked up by this zombie ghost guy its not the story that sucks the most its the atrocious acting and dialouge home made directing quality and an awful soundtrack not to mention laughable effects and some incredibly lazy film making these morons are outside in clear daylight yet we are meant to believe it's night what the hell was the director thinking with this move what he had only one day to film all this in he was scared of the dark is hilarious seeing a cop walking around in pure daylight with a torch acting as if its pitch black though br br i guess the positive side for the actors is they look like people who work in the local supermarket so at least they could possibly escape from this film without ever being noticed im sure one of the teens plays bingo down the local pub but she's 40 45 br br anyway good for a laugh but just another waste of film and time,0
i can only assume that the other reviewers of this film are stockholders in the production company as this was quite possibly the worst movie i've seen in the last five years from the opening shot of a rabbi laughing uncontrollably for no apparent reason it was clear that the actors in this film would kill to be considered b level both my wife and i were in a great mood before starting this film and we were genuinely looking forward to a funny popcorn movie we knew we hadn't rented citizen kane and we weren't expecting to see the most amazing movie ever however after 40 minutes of enduring the most painfully unfunny bit of garbage i've ever seen we shut it off instead of wasting another minutes of our lives br br if a comedy with no laughs terrible acting thin plot and annoying characters are your thing then this film is for you honestly troll 2 is better at least i laughed at the popcorn sex scene br br i cannot justify writing a longer review of this picture because i've already wasted almost an hour trying to find one joke,0
while not as famous as some of their other collaborations such as the black cat and the body snatcher this is a dandy little horror film even though the casting decisions were a bit odd boris karloff plays dr janos rukh a weird scientist who lives in the carpathian mountains near where the dracula character's home town bela lugosi plays dr benet whose nationality was never discussed though the name certainly sounds french i really think it would have made sense to have the two switch roles as the carpathian role seems tailor made for lugosi especially with his accent however despite this unusual twist the two still did excellent jobs karloff's was definitely the lead role but lugosi acquitted himself well as a relatively normal person something he didn't play very often in films it seems that dr rukh is a bit of a pariah as other scientists especially benet think his theories are bizarre and nonsensical however over the course of the film rukh turns out to be right and benet is especially generous in his new praise for rukh but unfortunately the wonderful new element that rukh discovered has the nasty side effect of turning him into a crazy killing machine don't you hate it when that happens while this could have just been a simple nice scientist turned mad story the plot was well constructed the characters nicely developed and the mad rukh was not a one dimensional killer but complex and interesting br br this film is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for people who hate old horror films you can really tell that universal pictures pulled out all the stops and made a bigger budget film instead of the cheap quickies both lugosi and karloff unfortunately gravitated in later years good stuff,1
i truly wish i was not writing this review i'm a christian so i waited anxiously to see this movie it seemed great a christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing not that i buy the bible code itself you can make it say anything you want i do however believe everything inside the bible so i'm sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes i had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while i was in the theater i would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable tension scenes i'm sure once the final credits began to roll however i could reflect there were many parts of the movie i liked some mostly unexpected plot twists some effects that were indeed special i'm not counting the visions those were poorly done and some interesting technical work fades sets that type of thing unfortunately i got the distinct impression that if i read the book of revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour i could've gotten a better script and the music was beyond cheesy even for a bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue so i wish i could be like everyone else in the theater like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was but i'm not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a biblical shell and slaps a christian stamp on it i need a good plot and believable dialogue before i can enjoy most movies and this just didn't have either i'm sorry but i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone and that's the tragedy when will we see some intelligent christian fiction it has to be out there somewhere,0
another case of a decent dvd case betraying the shot on video quality of the film br br it wasn't that bad rochon does a serviceable job and damn the cast is good looking i've never seen that many musclebound guys hang out together on a regular basis this movie really wanted to make you think rochon was the killer but it was not to be my biggest problem with the film was that by the end i didn't much care who was the killer and the real killer made little sense since it was out of the blue and the filmmakers were thinking 'ha betcha didn't see that one coming sucker ' yeah there were continuity errors about mainly with ms rochon's ever changing wardrobe but for an indie slasher it's not that bad i was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless but that was just a gimmick the dialog was overly think and painful at times br br just don't have high expectations going into this and it won't be that bad and lloyd kaufman's cameo is wonderfully understated,0
like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this film's title michael oblowitz's latest production has grace but it's also slow and ponderous the producer's last outing mosquitoman 3d had the same problem it's hard to imagine a boring shark movie but they somehow managed it the only draw for hammerhead shark frenzy was it's passable animatronix which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the ocean's surface but even that was only passable poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish with dolphins and whales the technology is all but wasted cloudy scenes and too many close ups of the film's giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of imax's stunning 3d capabilities there are far too few scenes of any depth or variety close ups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field so there is no contrast of depth michael oblowitz is trying to follow in his father's footsteps but when you've got shark week on cable his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment,1
i wasn't a fan of seeing this movie at all but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics br br overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like heaven a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess the movie was quite short though around 85 min but it was enough to tell the whole story build some character development and have a decent happy ending the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast especially jason biggs kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace br br overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating hey its a chick flick and i'm reviewing this movie from a guy's persepctive alright it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it,1
this was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a children's comic i gave it 2 out of 10 for it's attention to detail because for the most part it had a 70s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make up was good br br this was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally usually seen in one of their biographies no interviews with surviving cast members crew members production team members etc or their friends families and any biographers of those people in fact i know just as much now about the programme as i did before i watched this film that was based on the supposedly biographical book as for actually learning something that no one knew about the program and wasn't common knowledge well that never happened,0
the reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point it's obvious he hasn't been young or innocent in a very long time or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well meaning young characters actually thought they could make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace if only it was that easy but the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better as the situation gets worse and worse every single day well if you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem br br the central theme is that revenge begets more revenge which begets even more in an ever expanding bloodbath both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side which they think justify their committing even more in retaliation where does it end and apparently he missed the significance of the bubble referred to in the name which was that people living in tel aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them which is partly why they seemed so naive he also seemed to think that ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem which tells me he wasn't paying attention when ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered br br i found it very brave of the director the screenplay writer and both star crossed lovers to update the romeo juliet story to a modern troubled land and to make both lovers male let's be honest here very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female young love wins all hearts but when people's uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that incredibly these same people would rather have them hate each other then the conclusion is inevitable,1
there is nothing not to like about moonstruck i'm from a new york italian family and i actually get a little homesick when i watch it the actors actresses the plot the subplots the humor they were all fantastic it starts a little slow but a lot happens in that two days i fell in love with laboheme because of this movie on my list of favorite movies moonstruck is number 3 it's a feel good movie where you leave the theatre humming that's amore or repeating some of your favorite lines old man if you give those dogs another piece of my food i'll kick you till you're dead chrissy bring me the big knife who's dead do you love him loretta good because when you do they drive you crazy because they know they can i always put moonstruck on when there's nothing good to watch because it makes me happy,1
this is a great movie to see with your girlfriend my friend and i both love dance and ran into this movie at the video store we had to get it with no violence and such a warming story its a great movie to relax to and just enjoy your night i would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie,1
i noticed that this film has taken the brunt of a lot of insults it probably earned some of them but it wasn't that bad well i'll be honest i never want to see this film again it was a bad film but i don't hate this film it tried to tell a story as a drama this film could work very well actually i just think the filmmakers misgauged which road to take when they made this they should have added more funny bits if they wanted it to be a comedy with a rewrite it could have been a great film but as a satire it didn't work in its current form many scenes did not fit within the context of the plot for example the robbery scene makes little sense in the story still it wasn't the worst independent film ever made is it in the top 10 worst that's debatable,0
arg the shuffling dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our sanity in this all awful third film this time european terrorists irish i'd say hi jack an army convoy supposed to be transporting uranium they pull into a shipyard open the truck and discover our old friends the carnosaurs pandemonium comes visiting then when the rubber dinos chomp the terrorists the cops and some marines the whole film seems to be again largely inspired from alien as carnosaur 2 was with the pathetic marines going through the claustrophobic shipyard guns at the ready this third opus is probably the driest and ungoriest film of the lot with only one spurt of blood when a rubber dino rips a marine's head off the dinos are stiff shuffling creatures as usual and the t rex sounds like an enraged elephant when it roars it also appears to have no eyes one of the goofiest scenes of the film is when the coppers arrive on the scene they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear some weird noise coming from another truck on opening it surprise the rubber reptile gang burst out and devour them why were the dinos locked up in the second truck after escaping from the first how did they get locked in as the truck door could only be locked from the outside what was the point of filming this scene oh bother who cares both thumbs down for the over sized rubber iguanas,0
the writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much away from the film as to nearly render it unwatchable basic elements such as character development were glossed over at best inconsistencies also reared their ugly heads a massive mansion in the middle of the rural irish countryside characters just showing up in the gardens during a stormy night at very convenient times i might add all in all it wasn't bad i rated it a 4 based mostly on the story and talent of alison elliott,0
this film resembles in many ways enemy of the state' with will smith and gene hackman as we have an innocent black man being pursued by the government' with all the modern technology known to man usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster that does not apply here of course i love everything david morse does so maybe my comments are not fair but there were more good things about this film then that the main baddy played by doug hutchison was brilliant and the story flowed with excellent extras such as david paymer and robert pastorelli our hero alvin sanders played by jamie foxx was however irritating most of the part he is so out of place cracking bad jokes evoking no sympathy from the audience or not to begin with the strange thing is that he kinda grows on you and on his followers as well i didn't expect much when i rented it but was surprised with a good solid action movie with comedy bits 7 10,1
plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption murder power and the rest of thriller related topics characters are interesting though sometimes not realistic but interesting nevertheless br br development is slow like tea drinking ceremony visuals not stunning but good enough to ease the eye strain good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed nothing shocking too much nothing overexciting movie sitcom style br br i liked woody excellent performance had to fight the plot inadequacy and did the job pretty good the rest are bearable though very predictable the whole is watchable and better than most tv shows,0
this mindless movie is a piece of crap and boring like the full house repetitions for all the people who want to see a great exciting and cool horror movie shouldn't even think about watching this bunch of mindless work a f in my opinion i have one question what were they thinking let's make a list 1 bad script 2 bad script 3 bad script 4 bad acting 5 bad directing and last but not least a bad script i mean i am not like grumping about every movie but i was disappointed when i watched it this movie should be banned into a box locked and sunk down into the sea so please don't do something like this again please please please,0
a typical goth chick rainbow harvest looking like a cross between winona ryder in beetlejuice and boy george gets even with people she feels have wronged her with the help of an old haunted mirror that she finds in the new house she and her mom horror mainstay karen black the only remotely good thing about this travesty buy the acting's pretty laughably bad especially when rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror and there are no scares or suspense to be had this film inexplicably spawned thus for 3 sequels each slightly more atrocious than the last people looking for a similarly themed but far superior cinematic endeavor would be well advised to just search out the episode of friday the 13th the series where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror that packs more chills in it's scant 40 minutes than this whole franchise has provided across it's 4 films br br my grade d br br eye candy charlie spradling provides the obligatory t a,0
what starts out as a gentle country yarn inoffensive and mildly enjoyable romantic tale changes pace as edward norton's initially charming harlan gradually reveals more about himself and things take a turn for the sinister as the film gradually changes from a southern romance to a modern wild western br br an amiable rancher norton wanders into town and charms a young girl evan rachel wood seemingly rescuing her from a dead end existence with her bad tempered father with a whirlwind romance but it gradually becomes apparent that there is more to this cowboy than meets the eye br br edward norton  a real chameleon actor with changing facial hair to match playing a country hick accent slightly dodgy but maybe because he's merely trying to act the part without worrying about the accent he certainly makes it appear effortless to make all the nuanced little adjustments as we learn more about harlan however with too many small changes it means we are never sure exactly where harlan is coming from and what seemed like a good performance from norton gradually becomes confused evan rachel wood is likable without ever really having a great deal to do other than bat her eyelids at norton br br down in the valley strikes as a slightly uneven tale due to its change of pace and by never really making the protagonist's motives clear the audience's sympathies for the characters remain uncertain should we like this drifter or not even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear this ambiguity is to the film's detriment as if the writer could not make up their mind what kind of story they wanted to tell and settled for somewhat of a hotch potch had the film remained one or the other it might have been a solid film but as it is what we are left with is something of a mess fans of old fashioned romance will enjoy a portion of the film but will be put off by the darkening tone completist fans of norton aside or fans of the lush scenery of the san fernando valley give this a miss,0
i can understand why some people like this movie and why some people don't for me though i really like it even if i noticed some good bits and not so impressive bits the animation was actually excellent like charlie's dream the characters were a mixed bag the best being anne marie voiced by the late judith barsi i was physically ill when i read what happened to her also carface is a very convincing villain especially voiced by the wonderful vic tayback i particularly loved morons i'm surrounded by morons and along with rasputin and warren t rat is probably the most memorable of all the don bluth villains charlie and itchy only just lacked the same sparkle but i loved king gator and his song some of the film is very haunting like annabelle's you can never come come back which kind of scares me still unfortunately there were some bits i didn't like so much the story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused but disney's black cauldron suffered from the same problem also there were some dark scenes that young children would find upsetting but the ending is very poignant however the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung none of them in particular stick out with exception of let's make music together and love survives and burt reynolds can't sing and dom deluise has done much better singing all in all a watchable movie that could have been more but is definitely memorable and i would definitely watch it again 7 10 bethany cox,1

i saw and liked the first two a lot really especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first and it's a story standing alone you don't have to know the first movie i liked that in the free willy movies too br br but the third here is absolutely useless i tried it with a friend of mine because we both liked the first two we decided to stop after a good half an hour the movie is okay there are funny parts in it alright but what for timon and pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies what lion king 1 1 2 is for me is a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already plus telling the story from their point of view but what for i'd really like to know you know the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one is really nice but what comes after is mostly unnecessary i guess many people liked timon and pumba and so do i really yet for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny no chance most of it wasn't funny at all at least for me btw what was the movie about anyway was it a about timon and pumba or b an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie i tend to choose option b and i'm very disappointed about it br br if you like to see stories like the story behind xy you should see rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead by tom stoppard with tim roth and gary oldman that's really funny and no try to get more out of hamlet then it has,0
myself and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of tenko and agree this is by far one of the bbc better series the whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wont be the same without it no doubt we will be watching it again as it is a series which i would never get sick of watching excellent viewing and full marks to the bbc for such a brilliant series and the casting first rate in all departments and would recommend this series to anyone although some age limits must be considered because of some adult material so grateful to the bbc for releasing this series on dvd and video,1
this was a movie about infidelity and revenge a twin with the twin connection senses that something is wrong with her sister this movie took forever to establish the plot a plot that has been done many times the acting was lousy for the most part once the plot comes together the movie ends laura and ashley are twins that live with an abusive father the father seems to favor ashley so laura gets the blame for everything there is a promise made that the girls would never be apart but as they grow up their lives go in different directions ashley gets a job in a diner where she meets barry a married man of course no good can come of this the fact that barry had tinnitus was a poor excuse for a way to track him down i kept waiting for this movie to get better and for there to be some resolution somewhere but it never happened,0
disappointing film performance of actors is weak sets are fine could have been better the story is also weak battle sequences are awful sounds and quality of film are trashy the history of kazakh people was told very poorly this film should have included more kazakh actors in leading roles and also should have been in kazakh language kuno bekker and jay hernandez are hispanic origins i don't get it since when hispanic people play turkic mongolian people this film is shame of kazakh cinema rustam ibragimbekov disappointed me he is one of the finest filmmakers in the world czekh director is excused since he is not nomadic origin he cannot know true spirit and history of nomads,0
a one is the highest rating i could have given this movie considering zero and negative numbers are not allowed pee yew pointless mess of a movie with a lot of wasted b list actors who have done better work written and directed by some guy with the mentality of a twelve year old who smirks and giggles at stupid puns and poop and fart jokes for example gene stapelton's ding bat from all in the family character telling marilu henner's character that she swings both ways sexually was a cheap attempt at humor indicative of the general lameness of the movie you want good cheeky humor rent animal house american pie part one only old school or office space,0
i saw this film by accident and this movie was an accident well it must of been blonde women being stalked the villain appearing then disappearing getting from one place to another in minute's then disappearing and reappearing hiding he was'nt even a super hero so i don't know how he did it he could'nt frighten a cat and that's not hard to do br br the old mirror in the bathroom is just not scary anymore in fact it stopped being scary years ago you had the cop on the trail of the villain another cliché played by idris elba with a very convincing american accent he's from london the director did'nt have a clue and has made a film full of cliché's and make's scary move which was a comedy look scary pathetic,0

this movie documents the harlem ball circuit of the mid eighties much more fun than than palazzo volpi though just as diseased this movie is a true gem of squalor one cannot help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness the sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomenons of the trash and the glitz here the most genius of trash is extremely well documented and duly glamorized the characters' penchant for idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves on part of the viewer creating a phenomenon of a phenomenon effect which makes this movie a piece of art,1
what a delightful film br br accompanied by oscar winning composer rachel portman's lush emotional and dreamy music this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year br br incredible casting br br gwyneth paltrow was perfect for the role of emma toni collette was great as harriett smith br br the character who stole the film was miss bates she was mesmerizing to watch one finds oneself on the edge of ones' seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her one of the most endearing characters i have come across in ages from one of the opening scenes when she is thanking mr woodhouse for sending that lovely quarter hind of pork pork mother she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired mother mrs bates played by emma thompson's mother phyllida law who looks forlorn and lost br br the comical ways that emma would avoid the grating miss bates builds itself up for one truly gut wrenching scene at the picnic when emma insults miss bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart we then see poor miss bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one's heart ripped out to her on her behalf it is a classic scene one to be rewound and played over over br br the ending is right up there with sense sensibility and provides one of life's greatest lessons about how one should marry one's best friend br br i hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself br br i adored it,1
this is the worst show i have seen in years i believe that it should be taken off of t v because of its retardedness it is so dumb i could faint when i watch it even though i never watch it because it is sooooo poor br br goofs when mac says he can t eat sugar in another episode he eats sugar almost everything in the world has sugar in it in episode eddie monster when eddy screams at terrance he falls into the crate twice plus the seconed time he falls in he doesn't fall in he falls off to the side what stupidity i can't even say the word fosters home i even made a song with my band about how retarded this show is byyyyyyyyeeeee,0
while traveling by train through europe the american jesse ethan hawke and the french celine julie delpy meet each other and decide to spend the night together in austria on the next morning jesse returns to united states of america and celine to paris br br before sunrise is one of my favorite romances indeed one of the most beautiful love stories i have ever seen it is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline but the chemistry between ethan hawke and julie delpy is perfect and the dialogs are stunning the direction is amazing transmitting the feelings of celine and jesse to the viewer i have just completed my review number 1 000 in imdb and i choose before sunrise for this significant number because it is a very special film for me i cannot understand why this movie was not nominated to the oscar with such a magnificent screenplay direction and performances yesterday i have probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time and i still love it my vote is ten br br title brazil antes do amanhecer before sunrise,1
woody allen has lost his ability to write dialogue or characters that are clearly distinguishable from each other this is the case with melinda and melinda where all the characters speak with allen's generic pseudo sophistication and have problems and points of view that are not relatable to anyone outside of a four block radius of where allen lives they also share the same curious condition of being able to afford multi million dollar manhattan apartments that appear to have been designed by professional decorators regardless of their financial situation or what they do for a living br br the only character who exists outside of this dull mindset is will ferrel as the obligatory woody allen surrogate although he does not simply come off as merely doing a woody allen impression like kenneth branagh in the god awful celebrity ferrel lacks the charm or charisma that the real woody had when he was playing the part himself in his best movies br br the end result is another in a string of self indulgent bores from a once great filmmaker who has been trading in on his former reputation for years,0
cafe lumiere is a beautifully photographed nullity unacquainted with the work of the director i am well acquainted with the filmmaker he is supposedly paying tribute to ozu yasujiro while not even approaching ozu in greatness hou has communicated nothing of ozu's depth of emotion and concentration on meaning within a closed space one of the things he misses entirely is ozu's attention to character we are not even introduced by hou to his lead character a perfect blank page there are no medium or close shots of his people one of the dvd extras offers interviews with the actors and gives us precisely what hou doesn't a good look at their faces br br there was a great spanish film by bardem called nunca pasa nada which translates to something like nothing ever happens that would be a far better title to this pointless exercise all through the film we are given clues about an obscure taiwanese composer some of whose work we hear on the soundtrack but the clues like everything else add up to nothing unless you're a trainspotter this film has nothing to recommend it,0
i have to say i was really looking forward on watching this film and finding some new life in it that would separate it from most dull and overly crafted mexican films i have no idea why but i trusted sexo pudor y lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non existent industry maybe it was because the soundtrack which i listened to before i saw the film sounded different from others maybe it was because it dared to include newer faces apart from demian bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors and supposedly dealed within it's script with modern social behaviour maybe because it's photography i saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical the film turned out to be a major crowd pleaser and a major letdown what serrano actually deals here with is the very old fashioned battle of the sexes as in all men are the same and why is it that all women blah blah blah nothing new in it not even that it uses so much common ground and clichè that it eventually mocks itself without leaving any valuable reflexion on the female male condition full of usual tramps on the audience like safe gags about the clichès i talked about before those always work always and screaming performances it is a well acted film in it's context and by screaming i mean literally the at first more compelling characters played by monica dionne and demian bichir turn out to be according to serrano the more pathetic ones i completely disagree with serrano they shouldn't have been treated that way only to serve as marionettes for his lesson to come through he made sure we got his message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only solid ground in which this story could have stood anyway it is after all a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it if you accept to be manipulated by it,0
this is absolutely the best none animated family film i've seen in quite a while back to the first homeward bound paulie is a humerous movie about life through a parrot's pov it's a really touching movie and ranks high among family films up to disney status imho,1
this movie wants to elaborate that criminals are a product of modern society therefore can thieves rapists and murderers the killer of this movie carl panzram james woods is all three and worse be held fully accountable for their deeds an interesting notion but very difficult to bring to the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfying way and this is where killer a journal of murder falls very short although the film tries to put panzram's behaviour into perspective with flashbacks to his violent youth and dysfunctional upbringing the viewer never gets the idea that panzram is a victim rather than a culprit sure the system is corrupt with one mobster occupying the whole sick bay of leavenworth prison where most of the movie takes place most prison guards are sadistic bullies and the prison director something like a megalomaniacal despot but why on earth does new prison guard henry lesser robert sean leonard take such pity on panzram even after having read his gruesome diaries the movie offers some explanation lesser witnesses panzram being beaten to a pulp by the most sadistic and stereotypical guard and is impressed by panzram's intelligence though it isn't clear why exactly lesser thinks this man is so smart surely this isn't enough to sympathize with a hostile man like panzram even though this movie tends to downplay his crimes and highlight his personality towards lesser panzram is quite loyal and the viewer is given the impression that for lesser this outweighs all of the atrocities he has read about in panzram's diaries does this man lesser have so little friends that he takes at face value everyone who seems only remotely friendly to him perhaps it is lesser who is a product of modern society judging on appearance rather than substance br br i can advise monster starring charlize theron and christina ricci as a movie which handles roughly the same themes with far more integrity and scope br br btw killer looks as though shot for tv not so good,0
this is the worst brain damaged ultra cheap super stupid silly pointless piece of trash i've ever seen an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre if you think that ed wood's plan 9 is bad well let me tell you looks like citizen kane compared to that one ¿special effects again plan 9 is star wars ¿acting thor johnson is al pacino so it's beyond bad really but if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies it's for you i'm a fan of american international for so many glorious horror movies the price corman poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff but with star creatures they descend right down to the z level of course my 1 out of 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun the guy playing an indian chief is great so have fun and enjoy if you can,0
this must be accompanied by a special rating and warning not recommended to normal people br br the obsession of daneliuc with the most dirty body functions becomes here a real nightmare also it's evident that the man is a misanthrope he hates everybody his country his people his actors his job and this hatred makes him blind and he forgets anymore the profession he knew long ago br br this so called film is just a hideous string of disgusting images with no artistic value and no professionist knowledge it is an insult to good taste and to good sense shame shame shame,0
i really enjoyed the detail that went into the script br br jonathan rhys myers misspelled and jewel were outstanding in their support roles as was jeffery wright toby mcguire gave as fine a acting job as ever depicted when he had to amputate his best friend's arm knowing he would die without the procedure br br attention to detail with good dialect coaching to catch the southern accent incredibly well br br why this movie was swept under the rug by the hollywood promoters i can only imagine i have strong suspicions which makes it all the more appealing to me i have given a dozen dvd copies out for presents br br completely overlooked movie rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a couple of hours then judge,1
as you may have gathered from the title i wholeheartedly believe this movie to be the worst zombie movie of all time the acting camera work writing special effects and anything else remotely related to this movie sucked people have argued that while this movie is terribly acted and terribly produced but it comes through with a witty intelligent script wow the plot has more holes than i or anyone else could possibly count for starters why would the government tell everyone to go back to work when it's not safe i know the government's supposed to be evil but they don't gain anything by killing the entire population of the country there wouldn't be anyone to govern another thing that i was wondering about even if the government told everyone to go to work why would people go if the streets were swarming with zombies were the zombies going to hide in the bushes and ambush the unsuspecting people in order to aid the government in their plot to kill everyone on the planet and how about the ending that stupid torch guy sacrifices his life in order to get a few close up shots of the zombies he probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature and another thing why does he say hindenburg before he dies the hindenburg was a rare event seen by a very few people the zombie menace will been seen by everyone in the country possibly the world he doesn't think anyone else will get a few snapshots they also managed to ruin the only semi interesting scene in the film when the soldier is watching the exotic dancer why did the zombie hide behind a curtain for five minutes before attacking the girl especially when the zombie could have come through the door it's probably just something an unintelligent zombie movie fan such as myself wouldn't understand every day i pray that god with increase my brain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuances in feeding the masses br br anywho i think it's interesting that this is the first movie that gave me the desire to physically hurt the people involved in the production hey trent haaga i'm calling you out,0
vincent cassel plays the part of paul an ex con assigned to an office job where he meets carla a secretary who is quite deaf' when she has her hearing aids in very deaf when not played by emmanuelle devos together they help each other to develop as people br br what was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters  not fitting into obvious stereotypes paul appears uneasy in the office environment is it that he's just not cut out for work this belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shines br br the film has a certain amorality which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally even if we think it is harmless or justified br br finally it is a film full of great moments' both touching and humorous one is when carla is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby she continues to cuddle it  but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort,1
this movie should not be viewed unless you are trying to kill yourself i think this movie could actually cause severe brain damage the main characters are the whiny non hero kevin amy his bratty ungodly conservative girlfriend kyle a dork in red shorts who enjoys phone sex daphne a scrawny horny girl who is supposed to be cool and has no sense of how to dress and her oversexed boyfriend nick an army recruit who can make an innuendo out of anything no i'm not a pervert that's really how the movie goes the movie itself is an over sexed rip off of 1986's gremlins only you'll never find a trace of gizmo anywhere no these hobgoblins unleashed by wimpy man i'm sorry kevin make someone's wildest dreams come true and then kill the victims yes you guessed it eventually they wind up in a strip club where the nerdy amy's greatest dream is revealed she wants to be a stripper look i watched this flick via mst3k and even with mike nelson tom servo and crow t robot making a laughing stock out of this cinematic trainwreck and it still made me bleed from both eyes not really but i wish i had i'm not giving you anymore plot because reliving it gives me this great urge to drive a pitchfork through my brain besides it's not like there's a plot worth mentioning they should put a surgeon's general warning on this film,0
this movie begins with an ordinary funeral and it insists so hard on this ordinary funeral feel that i lost interest within 5 minutes of watching and started skipping scenes it seems to me whomever made this movie is afflicted to the extent of becoming trapped in a permanent morbid trance unable to contemplate anything else but death and destruction well i ain't one of the dark kids from southpark i want a movie that within 10 minutes gets me well into an interesting story i won't sit and watch 10 minutes of nothing but preparations for a funeral my grandma on her last years was fascinated by funerals perhaps she might have enjoyed this movie,0
did anyone else feel as betrayed as i did the first hour or so was pretty solid but the last oh my god it seemed like it was predictable and cheesy not grandiose and epic like the entire run of the show has been most reviews have read have been glowing but i really can't understand why i had seriously predicted that general ending way earlier on but then retracted it because i thought no they would never do that that's far too lame i can hardly stand it i feel so unsatisfied i think i'm about to walk out the door to go sell every season i own someone please change my mind i want to love this so bad someone tell me why i'm wrong great show terrible ending,0
when i was a kid i watched this many times over and i remember whistling the happy cat song quite often all the songs are great and actually memorable unlike many children's musicals where the songs are just stuck in for no real reason the scenes and costumes are lavish and the acting is very well done which isn't surprising considering the cast christopher walken is very catlike and doesn't need stupid make up or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he's a cat transformed to a human and jason connery's so cute as the shy and awkward miller's son corin who falls in love with beautiful and the bold princess vera this is a really fun enjoyable feature length movie where unlike most fairytales the characters are given personalities some of my favourite parts are when puss makes corin pretend he's drowning at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance as it's all the rage abroad when walken is in the kitchen dancing on the table he's a pretty good dancer too and when vera tells corin all the things she used to do when she was young like pretending she was a miller's daughter i'd recommend this film to children and parents alike who love magic and fairytales and it actually is a movie you can watch together as it won't drive adults up the wall,1
there is no way to avoid a comparison between the cat in the hat and the grinch who stole christmas so let's get that part out of the way first of all let me start by saying that i think grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film cat was well just awful br br jim carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian and fearlessly commits to over the top outrageous characters mike myers fell back on his old bag of tricks br br why why why mike myers the kids could care less and the austin powers demographic isn't going to spy this film so what was the studio thinking br br the cat was also apparently related to linda richmond can we talk why a new york accent not entirely consistent with anything dr seuss has ever written myers was even allowed to sneak in his scottish shtick i wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said as long as you don't say fahklempt' you can keep the accents meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort either with the costume make up or dialogue br br the jokes what few there were were crude and age inappropriate when myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers to the camera dirty ho everything but the rim shot was missing and even that wouldn't have helped br br the same folks who created 'whoville' clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in 'cat' the sets and props were very appealing giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing direction and myers br br there was some fun to be had with alec baldwin and kelly preston dakota fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a dr seuss classic and stayed true to the genre br br call the spca this cat should be neutered and never be allowed to reproduce again please please no sequel,0
this is a film about life the triumph over adversity and the wonders of the human spirit i defy anyone not to shed a tear by the end of the movie this is more than just a tear jerker its an engaging thought provoking drama with excellent performances from all the cast but especially derek luke and denzel washington 7 years on i'm amazed that luke is still a virtual unknown and washington only directed one other film nevertheless apart from a slow build up the story of this foster child's trials and tribulations and how it still affects him in adulthood is the sort of movie that stays with you long after you have seen it like many fox searchlight pictures this was more of a sleeper hit and didn't get the mass critical acclaim it deserves the scene where antwone finally meets his mother summed up the movie for me there were so many ways that could have been done and it could have been all schmaltzy or it could have been unrealistic but washington struck exactly the right tone his mother never said a word and could only shed a tear while antowne asked simply why her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything what could she say to defend herself one of the most moving cinematic scenes i have seen,1
from the stupid quaint african natives travelogue footage with our badly superimposed principals acting as narrators to the horrible fake ears which transform docile indian elephants into african elephants to the utter lack of any logic at all to maureen o'sullivan's incessant whining of tarzan tarzan there is nothing about this movie which deserves classic status br br 4 10,0
my friends usually can put up with a lot of hopeless movies but this one was too poor for us to even watch it to the end it was just so boring and unoriginal not even the hot girls that starred in this movie could keep me watching everything was just predicable and annoying br br the acting was at times good but more times bad the most annoying character in the whole movie that you just wanted to die would have to be the main characters best friend the more i saw him the more i wanted to smash my screen you know what fat ugly kid i'm talking about br br the plot has been done so many times before i think they should be sued by other movie companies ok it is a good idea but thats all this movie had br br overall this movie can only be watched if by your self to save any abuse from your friends or if you have absolutely nothing better to do,0

being a fan of billy bob thornton and the diversity of his skills i noticed this movie listed and was surprised i hadn't heard of it br br i'd traveled more than usual during both the period it was being filmed in 2000 and when it hit theaters more than 2 1 2 years later that passage of time is the first clue all was not well with the production br br now patrick swayze can't act for sour apples but thornton has more than enough ability to make up for the difference between them and charlize theron is someone whom it would be a pleasure to see even if it showed her watching paint dry br br being curious i checked this site's production info it made a whopping 600 per screen its opening weekend and just over 400 each after its month's theater run in latter 2002 overall gross was 261k which i'd doubt could cover cast and crew's hotel and food for a week on location br br the story is pretty benign and even the use of the usually interesting locale of reno is as dull as the rest of the goings on br br it's something like several snl bits all pieced together none individually too great at all and the overall presentation even worse br br whatever the expenses for this production had to be considerable even if all worked for less than their usual fees so the one thing which made it a barely tolerable opus was the quality of the filming and billy bob's present albeit understandably somewhat laconic here compared with his usual work br br think of the three superb totally diverse characters he portrayed in sling blade bandits and bad santa and you know he realized this work was below standard long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm this one star for him even here and one because production was better than say the typical lifetime flick,0
myron breckinridge rex reed gets a sex change from a doctor john carradine dead drunk and comes out as myra raquel welch she then decides to destroy male masculinity or something like that and proceeds to teach film history at an acting college run by lecherous john huston don't ask and break up a young happy couple young handsome hunky roger herren and farrah fawcett yes the farrah fawcett br br they took a great novel by gore vidal that was unfilmable and naturally tried to film it they also hired an english guy with a decidedly anti american attitude and hired a bunch of actors with questionable talent welch reed and embarassed old professionals huston carradine andy devine jim backus mae west threw it all together and surprise an absolute disaster br br the film got an x rating at its release it's been lowered to an r mostly because of a truly tasteless scene in which welch sodomizes rusty roger herren and a scene in which welch attempts to have sex with fawcett br br the movie is very scattershot scenes jump all over the place and people say and do things that make no sense it's not good at all but i was never bored br br acting varies wildly reed is horrible really sad huston chews the scenery again and again and again to a nauseating extreme welch is actually not bad as myra but her lines make no sense so you never know what to make of her west is hardly in the movie a blessing and it's really kind of sick to hear a woman almost 80 years old cracking sex jokes roger herren whatever happened to was very young handsome and not bad as rusty fawcett is ok br br it's hard to find things to say about this you just watch it in disbelief a must see movie to believe,0
wow you guys are way too nice corny corny corny that is how i feel about that film it started well with a good idea a guy edward asner escape from jail dressed as santa a bunch of kids find him and believes his the real santa so the fake santa enlist the children to help him find a bag of stolen money the film is like a christmas version of whistle down the wind the movie start well but gradually it becomes cheesier and cheesier to the point that at the end it becomes ridiculous and you just cant take this film seriously for example you get the scrooge type character called sumner rene auberjonois who's a total douchebag who treat his young son like a pile a rubbish he treat his son so bad that he don't even buy him decent clothes the poor kid wears jeans with holes in it but a 45 second scene with fake santa visiting sumner and by the end of the film you get the guy all happy singing christmas carol and giving his neglected son a hug yep that is how corny it is i'm all for feel good movie especially during christmas and i am a big fan of seasonal tv movie but this one is way too over the top for me it is a shame because it started well but the second half of the movie is trowing a supernatural element to the film that just don't match with the rest of it it's not totally bad there are some solid acting especially from the children but there are plenty of better christmas film around,0
i caught this movie at a small screening held by members of my college's gaming club we were forewarned that this would be the reefer madness of gaming and this movie more than delivered br br tom hanks plays robbie a young man re starting his college career after resting for a semester what we the viewer find out as the movie progresses is that robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role playing game called mazes and monsters a game that he gets re acquainted with after a gaming group recruit him for a campaign br br this movie is laughable on many many levels one scene features the group gaming by candlelight which is probably the best way i can describe it while i'm sure that this was meant to be cultish in some way as most gamers know it's horribly inaccurate most role play sessions are done in well lit rooms usually over some chee tohs and a can of soda br br the acting while not oscar caliber isn't gut wrenchingly awful either this is one of tom hanks's first roles and bosom buddies and bachelor party were still a year or two over the horizon the supporting cast while not very memorable still hand forth decent performances br br mainly the badness lies in the fact that it was a made for tv movie that shows the dangers of gaming worth a view if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night,0
i suppose it's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this with the sometimes pointless excesses of many hollywood films we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions foul language and corny one liners minimalism has its place and can be very effective when employed properly however this film is not one of those cases br br take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary sparse scenery i'm sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement the acting is poor bland and pedestrian and features one of the worst crying scenes in history at the end of the film if you can sit through it to the end the scenery is drab and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled i would call this anticlimatic but as the film didn't build to any sort of climax whatsoever not even in the erotic scenes it would be untrue i'm sure that there was a script employed during the filming but with the amount of dialogue i think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin basically this film offers nothing to interest or amaze no great story no stunning insights no visual drama no excitement apart from two or three amusing moments this film is a waste of two hours a tragically boring and dreary film,0
predictable hackneyed poorly written foolishly i reasoned such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit i guess competition amongst actors is so intense these days and will only get worse that one cannot pick and choose much any more early on we were given an inkling who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throats ever since the movie lacked intrigue giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder some of the discourse was frankly embarrassing it's hard to believe anyone would even consider let alone commit to the spending of tens of millions of dollars to make this tripe,0
this is an almost action less film following jack an insomniac as he goes through hallucinations is visited by dead friends throws himself off a building and for a lot of the time can't tell reality from hallucination br br dominic monaghan as jack is truly believable confused and scared but lethargic and at times blankly accepting of what he sees we follow him trying to sort out what he's seeing and find a way to sleep br br introduce a talking dog another hallucination and children that suddenly appear in jack's bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there more hallucination and you have an interesting mind boggling 43 minutes and the shower scene is enough to get any dom fan coming back for more,1
this movie was worth five punches on my hurter card i saw this while stationed in virginia in the mid '70's i saw it alone so i was not distracted while i watched it it sucked it was the most ridiculous total waste of celluloid i've ever seen br br i know that others who have reviewed this movie have thought that it was awesome i offer you this if it was so awesome what was it's box office take end of discussion,0
to be honost with you i think everything was so good in this movie there should be no reason why it didn't go into theaters the deaths in the movie are awesome the fx are awesome when used there are a few dull moments when the story's following the little girl but all in all this was a very good movie that i hope someday get's the props it should the very first part of the movie is prob why it came straight to video with them killing a little boy but after that the story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to visit the moms boyfriend who moved out to try to become a writer the property he buy's turns out to be where the witch tooth fairy lives and anyone who live in her house or goes on her property will be in great danger don't wanna give anything really away just a little info if you've wanted to see this movie then do so it's worth the price of the rental,1
i would give this movie 5 rather than 3 if it would be at least in time when i've seen it in first time it was just what you could wait from the work that is based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or i would rather say idiotic habits of our kazakhstan government it's a shame because 'qazaqfil'm' was been shooting nice movies when it was not honoured by the name of shaken aimanov but it was actually ran by him the movies like 'konec atamana' 'kyz zhibek' or even 'aldar kose' but after mr aimanov's death the production of quality movies went down almost dramatically in 10 years time there were very few films produced however in late 1980s 'assa' was shot it was a film about first organised crime groups in the big country one year later mr rashid nugmanov shot another film with the co staring of the same actor singer v tsoy at that time he was already a soviet russian rock legend the movie called 'igla' the needle or something it was completely new somebody called that period as resurrection or a new kazakh movie wave unfortunately nowadays we do not have a quality movies our directors shooting movies on the french and japanese financial support and thus movies are not for the public but for the authors professional critics some of them take a price on international author movie festivals but there a very few of them become a business asset products and again back to our 'nomads' such movies usually unpopular because of vast aspects the same effects was with nikita mikhalkov's 'sibirski cyrilnik' about russian tsars that was also shot on parities with foreign partners i think they were french or maybe british nobdy liked it even in russian public it become as a main topic of a comedians and comedy shows like 'kvn' imho,0
val kilmer and dylan mcdermott are terrific i have seen kilmer on the doors however his interpretation of john holmes is superb nothing compared to boogie nights which was kind of slow wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just indulged in his drug vice and indolent of what ever happens around at the same time the john holmes character shows a very clever hustler who is able to pass through the nastiest and ugliest situations almost unharmed the movie deserves being watched more than once the seventies ambiance sensual and full of drugs is amazing,1
in the first howling we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized the plot in that film made some sense a tv reporter investigates this and attempts to uncover the truth she ends up having to kill many of them including her boyfriend who becomes one then she shows the world that they do exist by transforming on live tv the special effects were just laughable in the first movie and they don't get any better in this one whether it's the transformations or the bad puppets or the cheesy computer graphics showing the superpowers br br the plot line isn't all that bad they must kill the leader of the werewolves for some reason this won't destroy all werewolves and it really doesn't end the threat from werewolves as it they just want to kill her i think there was some cloudy reason for this but it really gets lost in the film br br after the film ends we have a 10 minute montauge of the movie we just watched and every other scene is one where the female werewolf leader rips off her top exposing her large breasts while some devo esquire band plays to a crowd of werewolves br br the only thing that makes this movie even watchable is christopher lee,0
richard farnsworth is one of my favorite actors he usually gives solid performances such as in the straight story and the grey fox he also does fairly well here but the rest of the film suffers from a low budget poor writing and so so photography the miller movie formula gives it a 4 richard gets a 5,0
this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen it shows a china i had never seen or imagined and i believe it shows 1930's china in the most real light ever seen in a movie it is absolutely heart breaking in so many situations seeing how hard life was for the characters and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful you truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film the actors are all perfect such that you feel like you have really entered a different world br br i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough it may just change you forever once you have seen it,1
a surprising misfire from the usually reliable larry cohen god told me too q etc full moon high tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably even with decent turns by ed mcmahon and kenneth mars alan arkin looks embarrassed throughout his performance and son adam simply looks numb this makes teen wolf look like a comedy classic,0
yes it may be goofy and may not seem as funny as many high budget comedies out there but this movie is truly hilarious if you really watch it tim meadows has always struck me as being funny off of the saturday night live show whenever he would do this character on the show i would crack up laughing so after i saw this was going to be playing on comedy central one night i decided to check it out all in all i was farily impressed with this movie because it wasn't meant to win any oscars or become comedy of the year but it did entertain the saturday night live fans that love the ladies man character this movie is also packed with some highly quotable lines that can be recited for years to come,1
and what a combo two of the century's great singers star together in this underrated musical he writes music she writes lyrics and they both work for basil rathbone who can't write either because his wife died actually she just got fat best scene is the pawn shop number where bing sings an impromptu number while the swing band gets their instruments out of hock just wonderful and this is a rare starring role for broadway legend mary martin and she's quite good charley grapewin john scott trotter william frawley oscar levant once again the manic pianist charles lane and helen bertram co star and who knew rathbone could be funny,1
when i bought my toy story tape when it came out to video after being released in theaters i saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of toy story as soon as i saw that i knew this was gonna be a good feature i was right a bug's life like toy story is great story great characters and great animation my favorite characters are dim the rhino beetle voiced by brad garrett and hemlich the caterpillar voiced by the late pixar storyman joe ranft my favorite scene is when slim the walking stick david hyde pierce lifts up hemlich trying to distract the bird and hemlich's like you hoo mr early bird how about a nice tasting worm on a stick and slim's like i'm going to snap i'm going to snap i just died laughing at that scene being a big fan of insects i think a bug's life is my favorite pixar even though i know a lot of people consider it the worst pixar film ever i don't know how you could hate a pixar film i think they're all pretty good films good job pixar,1
this was the modesty that we didn't know it was hinted at and summarized in the comic strip for the syndicates to sell to newspapers lee and janet batchler were true modesty blaise fans who were given the dream job tell a prequel story of modesty that the fans never saw before in their audio commentary they admitted that that they made changes in her origin to make the story run smoother the purists should also note that we really don't know if everything she told miklos was true because she was stalling for time i didn't rent or borrow the dvd like other reviewers did i bought it and i don't want a refund i watched it three times and i didn't sleep through it great dialog and well drawn characters that i cared about even bad guy miklos just like in the novels and comic strips i too can't wait for the next modesty and willie film especially if this prequel is a sign of what's to come,1
this is the kind of film one watches in gape jawed horrified silence and yet continues to watch mesmerized as if watching a train wreck in slow motion and yet in the back of your mind thoughts are churning who on earth green lighted this garbage br br some of the preceding user comments say things like a good way to introduce children to laurel and hardy an insult to children everywhere that children would need some sort of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy shows a profound misunderstanding of the nature of children the world over others have commented on the faithfulness of the two stars' characterizations of laurel and hardy to which i would respond so what one would think that the rash of movie bombs based on beloved series rocky and bullwinkle avengers flipper mod squad ad nauseam would have taught hollywood that there are some things that simply can't be recreated the films of laurel and hardy are readily available on video why bother with this br br as for f murray abraham a fine actor of stage and screen well all i can say is he must have been in trouble with the irs br br run don't walk away from the television if this trash comes on,0
i absolutely loved this show i watched it from the time it first aired in the late 90's to the very last episode in my honest opinion it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days definitely a show you could watch with a friend or your children yes things have changed a bit with jo since we last saw her in the books but it's still compelling with great stories and good lessons the actress that portrays jo bhaer michelle burke does a wonderful job as does as the actor who plays nick riley spencer rochfort throughout the series we get to see the developing romance between jo and nick as well as the daily stories and lessons the kids and students learn i recommend this show to anyone,1
obnoxious eva longoria dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel without wings falls on her off the back of a truck and kills her she is then tries to ruin the relationship of her ex boyfriend with his new girlfriend a psychic who can see her br br obvious unoriginal movie wouldn't be bad in a clichéd sort of way except that longoria's character is hateful and obnoxious that she drains all of the fun out of the film its like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper to be fair longoria nor anyone else in the cast or crew isn't the problem its the god awful script that sinks the proceedings its just really really stupid,0
the small california town of diablo is plagued with mysterious deaths after sheriff robert lopez unearths an ancient box legend has it that the box holds the sixteenth century mexican demon named azar fbi agent gil vega is sent to investigate the murders and joins forces with the sheriff's daughters dominique and mary to fight with evil and bloodthirsty demon the legend of diablo is an absolute garbage the film lacks scares and gore the acting is amateurish and the direction is bad the animation is the only one aspect of the film i enjoyed i'm a big fan of indie horror flicks for example i loved torched live feed bone sickness or neighborhood watch unfortunately the legend of diablo is a huge misfire definitely one to avoid,0
at the time my left foot was the little movie that could it was hugely popular and everyone applauded the fact that such a small independent film could make it all the way to the oscars br br since then movies like my left foot are a dime a dozen so it might be hard in retrospect to understand what all the fuss was about it's certainly a well made and competent film but it's clear that the bulk of its success rests on the shoulders of daniel day lewis who immerses himself in the role of cristy brown a man living with cerebral palsy day lewis pulls off the same bit of stunt acting that had won dustin hoffman an oscar the year before for playing a man with autism in rain man and the academy followed suit by giving day lewis the same honor br br the only thing really separating this film from a big budget hollywood production is just that its budget in every other way it's just as formulaic as any standard product that's not to say it isn't a good movie but it's not a masterpiece br br grade a,1
well it was a nice surprise after all its trailer did not predict a good film at all it was even a bit misleading especially the part of jeff bridges was a positive surprise well written sardonic and funny less real though i do not think a guy who got where he got would show signs of such irreverence towards everything that his current company stands for one does not become a top suit just to doubt it all suddenly again the ending of the film during the showing of dolce vita was too corny cliché and quite disappointing and of course a guy like pegg's character would not last past his first week in a blitz new york magazine like this i hope one day i will see a decent role written for megan fox here she looked a poor actress playing a bimbo and by the way i do not see why she is the sex symbol of the year i see hotter girls on nearly every cover of every magazine,1
spoiler this is a great film about a conure he goes through quite the ordeal trying to get back to his little girl owner he learns a lot through his journey and meets up with a lot of other beautiful birds if you love birds like my wife does this film is for you this film also has some sad parts that make the tears run in the end it all works out for paulie and his russian friend rent this for the whole family everyone will enjoy this,1
indian summer is a warm multi character film that would make a fine afternoon film with a bit of editing br br the film begins in the past with a group of children being shown a moose which sets the tone perfectly before cutting into the present when a group of adults from the golden age of the camp are invited back again to spend a few weeks holiday by the head of the camp uncle lou the film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp and form new memories in their latest stay br br the film succeeds in the great way it brings across its characters in this gorgeous setting and allows them room to develop without having to worry about plot developments watching these people reminisce and their relationships with each other is what the film is all about and why it works so well it never goes to over the top and melodramatic always keeping its warmth charm and realism i've never seen a film where nostalgia is captured so well and found myself getting drawn in despite never having been to one of these camps as a child myself br br for a warm nostalgic character movie i sincerely recommend,1
i didn't really like this movie that much at all it wasn't really funny and in some cases it was just downright stupid rob schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his acting was fine in this it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in i mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but that's about it the only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and i'm not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found all in all it was a couple notches below an average movie br br final query br br theaters so glad i didn't squander too much money on this br br dvd purchase ummm let me think no br br rental if you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not,0
if you are one of the people who finds according to jim great television comedy this is going to rock your world and might i add kudos for proving that good talent good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than abc which prefers to air crap like jim belushi's show year after year br br k 911 is a big steaming brown german shepherd sized thank you for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie it's exactly what fans of that film and the lesser belushi deserve jim's comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standard look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo chimpanzee br br if you enjoy jim's work this movie is your reward,0
this is a horrible little film and unfortunately the company that made this short made several others the short is essentially a one joke idea that wasn't funny to begin with and may also offend you it certainly made me uncomfortable watching very young children most appeared about 2 years old cavorting about and pretending to be adults in this case a dancehall girl and bar room patrons it's the sort of humor that you might be forced to laugh at from your own kids if they pretended to be adults but i can't see anyone wanting to see this especially when a very young shirley temple is dressed in a rather slinky outfit and acts like a vamp and then other kids act like adults in some rather adult situations at the time i am sure they were not trying to appeal to pedophiles but when looking at it today that is what immediately comes to mind because of this this boring film also creeped me out and i hope to never see it again pretty strange and pretty awful,0
jean marc barr being light the big blue dogville has directed and interpreted this strange movie which is the second installment of some kind of trilogy i might be wrong but i don't think this movie's part of the dogma '95 manifesto though it really looks like it i'm not really sure of what i think about this film all actors are good they deliver pretty good performances especially rosanna arquette and jean marc barr the story is somehow interesting but i don't know there's something about the movie that i don't like the sex scenes are way too long it goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of crap i don't know exactly where it stands sure it's not a bad movie but i won't suggest people to see it neither i'll tell them not to watch just do as you want if you feel curious and you're open minded give it a try you might like it,0
fascinating i approached i am curious yellow and it's companion piece with great trepidation i'd read numerous reports on its widely touted controversy and explicit sex what i got wasn't this but a thoroughly thought provoking and engaging cinema experience unlike any other i sincerely believe that the majority of the commenter who felt the film was lame' or boring' approached the film as if it were pornography perhaps this is pornography assuming pornography is something intended to titillate the senses but it is intentionally un erotic lena the protagonist throws her all into her performance giving it a realistic and humanity that is simply convincing and enduring her breasts may be saggy her nipples unusually large her thighs fat and her face chubby but by the end of the film the audience comes to identify with her and accept her faults as human this touch gives her even more believability out necessity had the director cast a briget bardot bombshell the effect would have been nullified i cannot more highly recommend this thought provoking piece be prepared to invest much thought in this deliberately paced film the patient and unassuming viewer will be thoroughly rewarded in ways most other films could dream,1
in 1692 salem a devious child's lies about a slave's involvement in witchcraft sends an entire community into an uproar costume drama starring claudette colbert and fred macmurray isn't stuffy though neither is it a vivid depiction of contagious hysteria worked on by three writers walter ferris durward grimstead and bradley king the story elements are rather interesting especially coming out of hollywood in 1937 though to anyone who has since read arthur miller's the crucible the hoked up melodrama on display here won't be tolerated for very long biggest problem with the picture may lie in the casting colbert and macmurray are an ill matched pair of lovers hindered by the witch hunt macmurray being far too contemporary a presence for these surroundings 1 2 from,0
i don't know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not compelling enough to care about perhaps it was the disorganized storyline perhaps it was the fact that rob lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song perhaps it was because the 1980s were never that 80s perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole perhaps it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out i don't know what it was that made me hate it so but if it means trying to watch it again i'm not willing to find out,0
anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies this film is riveting and doesn't have a boring moment why because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis i repeat intelligent dialogue that is what characterizes nearly all of rohmer's films and that is why a lot of people don't like them they prefer action fine let them spend the rest of their lives watching action films while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to seek out films like this br br rohmer has always been accused of being talky well he is but to me that's a compliment not a criticism shakespeare was talky too is there a talkier play than hamlet whenever the subject or theme of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values there must of necessity be a discussion of these ideas and values an that is largely what this film is all about aristocracy and noble birth vs egalitarianism loyalty to old friends that is put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life even if the person possessing that life is not so nice or even despicable anyone ever hear of dostoyevsky or crime and punishment these are what this film is all about br br the two leads in this film are impeccable as if they were born to play these roles lucy russell who is english and speaks french as her second language is especially brilliant do yourself a favor and see this riveting film it may be the last film by this screen master,1
the visuals and effects are up to par with the the original film and provide a lot of entertainment even if the storyline is essentially the same as the first two films it also seems a lot more erotically charged than i remember the other films being if you're a big fan of flying prehensile hair and tongues that can reach all the way down into your stomach you'll like this film,1
take this movie for what it is not a remake but a completely different approach to the same concept it's not an epic like the original it's more of a popcorn thriller visually it's incredible everything else was just ok br br for what it is i think the movie is awesome but i like everything burton has done people need to calm down and stop acting like it's the end of the world b c of this movie it wasn't supposed to be a remake and it's not br br the ending was cool i took it as a parallel universe,1

firstly this is simply the funniest movie i have ever seen it incorporates perfectly timed slapstick sexual humour and cleverly thought up stand up but it goes deeper than that the souler opposite is an original love story something we don't see that often that gave me hope that there is love out there that two people who love each other can work through their adversity and that such a comedic take on life something i believe we all should have can be accepted by the people that really matter chris meloni gives a such a convincing performance as barry singer that he should have won an oscar the film is brilliantly written and i hope we will be seeing more films from everyone involved in the future,1
this movie is one of the most awful i've ever seen not only is the dialogue awful it never ends you'll think it's ending but it's not how long is it 140 160 minutes i don't even know i do know that i'll never watch it again it's like someone took a romantic comedy took out the comedy then decided to downplay the romance leaving us with the pile of crap that managed to make its way to the screen but don't take my word for it find out for yourself how terrible this film is,0
this is without a doubt the funniest of the curly stooges shorts i've seen it dozens of times and it always makes me laugh hilarious pantomime sequences a perfect example of musical comedy even people who don't like the knuckleheads remember this one fondly,1
let's see i'm trying to practice finding the positive in everything so what kind thing can i say about the pallbearer br br i know the performances were no that won't work as they succeeded in draining all personality from gwyneth paltrow usually so vibrant and ended up creating caricatures out of carol kane and barbara hershey br br oh how 'bout the story nope that isn't gonna fly either as it was doze inducing what was the genre anyway it wasn't funny that rules out comedy it wasn't interesting enough to be dramatic was that a romance between schwimmer and paltrow i have to ask as i can't be sure let's just call it losers in like i'm sure those behind this film started with a vision i mean they must have had one to pitch to the studio suits but i need help finding it br br even if i were a patient person who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story i couldn't in good conscience recommend a film that allows a guy to go into a professional job interview in a windbreaker and messy fluffy stupid hair speaking of hair are we supposed to be amused by the deliberate black roots and platinum locks worn by hershey br br what am i doing i already lost 97 irretrievable minutes in the actual watching of the movie i cannot devote any more time to this loser,0
after viewing whipped at a distributor's screening at the afm the other night i have to say that i was thoroughly impressed the audience was laughing all the way through unfortunately every territory was already sold so i did not have the opportunity to purchase the film but i truly believe that it will be a big hit both domestically and over seas i agree with the comment that whipped should not be pitched as a male sex and the city mainly because unlike sex and the city whipped is a satire about dating that never takes itself too seriously whipped pokes fun at relationships in a way that most sex comedies wouldn't dare also the film that i screened at the afm had more of a plot and story than swingers clerks and sex and the city combined whipped never slowed down for a beat and provided the audience with non stop comedy the performances of amanda peet and the rest of the cast were all rock solid which only made the film more impressive considering the budget,1
an hilariously accurate caricature of trying to sell a script documentary hits all the beats plot points character arcs seductions moments of elation and disappointments and the allure but insane prospect of selling a script or getting an agent in hollywood and all the fleeting fantasy realizing but ultimately empty rites of passage attendant to being socialized into the system hotz and rice capture the moment of thinking you're finally a player only to find that what goes up comes down fast and in a blind siding fashion that for inexplicable reasons hollywood has moved on and left you checking your heart your dreams and your pockets pitch is a must see for students in film school to taste the mind and ego bashing gantlet that is for most the road that must be traveled to sell oneself and one's projects in hollywood if your teacher or guru has never been there they can't tell you what you need to prepare for this gantlet to enter the biz talent is necessary but far from sufficient,1
a charming little film set in the uk about the reunion of a wwii all girl almost swing band a fine cast of oldsters bring lighthearted perspectives on life to this fun tale with an award winning performance by dench and laine's always great pipes time well spent and a fun watch for all,1
i gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes this is definitely really about a 5 5 ummm it was kind of bloody had likeable shallow characters and it had some really hot babes in it i like the eclectic killer because he didn't kill people the same way everytime that sometimes gets old,1
for die hard judy garland fans only there are two 2 numbers that are really good one where she does a number with an older cleaning lady you've all seen the pics and a pretty good number at the very end there are a couple of scenes where the lines are funny but basically the script is so bad and the movie so dated that it's hard not to cringe at the awfulness throughout but it's worth the 2 50 to rent the movie just be prepared to fast forward it,0
bad acting bad lighting bad plot this had the quality of a porno movie i have seen more interesting home video of a boring wedding than this movie it sucked big time don't waste your time or money on this crap it's amazing that they allow this kind of smut to even be released on video it should be a crime,0
i caught sorrows lost at the new york film and video festival and i guess i had some high hopes for this film sadly this is just another visual fx calling card the story is pretty lame the bad lighting and camera work along with the less than great editing and music all make the film seem low quality br br is it really too much to ask that fx shorts have better stories and have the rest of the technical production be on par with the fx you can't just get away with cool fx in shorts anymore it's been 5 years since 405 made a big splash at least that short quick cool and was even a little funny none of that can be said about sorrows lost,0
as a former kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town i was looking forward to seeing this movie but what a disappointment although the acting and the production values aren't bad the script is awful the plot is unrealistic and the theme is disturbing br br the main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children i can hardly believe how regressive it is in it's view of women has the writer been living under a rock br br although i enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen i wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone it's terrible it's an embarrassment to the city it's named after,0
another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after batman dead end that just helps stimulate our taste buds and leave us wanting more this is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like even tough this is a fanfilm of sorts the attention to detail character and action is undeniably real although this is a limited resources production it puts to shame big budgeted star casted hyped productions other superhero related movies here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people finally a superman that actually looks super and looks like the real thing batman the way it should be without the flashy rubber casted ripped body armor to hide scrawny physiques for over paid actors that don't deliver i just wish that some sensible warner bros exec gives the ok to produce a full length adaptation of this jewel i don't care if it goes to theaters or straight to dvd i would never get tired of watching it just the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough for this hope the bigwigs at marvel dc productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look no more batman robin fiasco or hulk daredevil etc learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldn't be any reason to reinvent the hero for the movie just to have it bomb in theaters mr collora we need more directors like you,1
this is an odysessy through time via computer animation supposedly th work of over 300 artists made in the late '80s and released in 1990 this was cutting edge stuff for the day i thought it was good and quite interesting in spots br br most of the short scenes made no sense just forms evolving into other forms but that was fun to watch this is all about visuals not really about any kind of a story there were some strange sequences in which odd looking men creatures would dance around with birds overheard all of it is computer animated which was new back then even the term computer animated was not well known br br it's simply a chance to show off this new technology in short bits of cartoon like happenings with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes no words just pictures with electronic music stoners must have really loved this br br it's a nice intriguing 40 minutes of eye candy and head candy by today's cg effects this may have lost impact but i think you'd still be entertained by this,1
gosha's last great film of the 1960's a resolute stylist with a great sense of purpose to his films gosha teamed up with shintaro katsu of zatoichi fame to produce this scathing indictment of mindless nationalist loyalty br br tenchu heavenly judgment is the word that the loyalists to the emperor yell while assassinating enemies or traitors to the cause katsu plays up his character' simple minded allegiance to a manipulative politician all in the name of patriotic pride anybody who questions the politician is labeled a traitor and becomes an assassination target br br one of the best photographed films ever many shots are incredible compositions of form color and light the fight scenes are frequent and very bloody and brutal the blood becomes a part of the color palette gosha uses for his images gorgeous and disturbing while the personal story is simple to follow the historical background is complicated and while a basic history lesson for this time in japan would be very helpful you can struggle through the film without it the few drawbacks to the film are the music track the length and katsu's occasional scenery chewing he has a drunken scene that's way over the top for a film but actually a very accurate depiction of a drunk br br downbeat but one of the great chambara films,1
sex wish was actually released minus ten minutes of more ahem 'extreme' footage here in the uk back in the early days of the video boom and caused a tabloid storm in a teacup when it allegedly inspired a copycat murder case strangely enough the papers brushed this ultra disturbing flick under the carpet in their headlong rush to get the comparatively innocuous likes of frozen scream and night of the demon canned and the film has been all but forgotten as a result i jumped at the chance to watch it on a dvd rw and spent most of the film's duration with my jaw on the floor it's not so much politically incorrect as utterly demented a triple x take on michael winner's death wish did the title kind of give the game away as far as inspiration was concerned with hardcore sex and some truly nasty violence thrown into an already bubbling brew of seventies sleaze if you don't consider yourself to be squeamish this may force you to think again by the time sex wish is over you'll want to scrub your eyeballs clean with disinfectant and take a long hot shower to purge yourself if any film truly deserves the it's only a movie only a movie only a movie tag line it's this one br br highlights or lowlights a rapist using a vibrator on a victim as he masturbates over her harry reems's scene stealing moustache the helpless young black couple who are forced to screw in front the sword cane killer they'd have won oscars for their entirely credible performances if the academy had gone mad before the man is castrated for his troubles and some jarringly slick direction that threatens to lift the proceedings above their obvious grind house origins don't say i didn't warn you if you thought the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago sex wish will prove you very very wrong,0
the movie was a long awaited release which where a bit disappointing because of the expectation's i had set up when looking at it again i must say it is actually pretty ok first of all is it very true to the original history of course not completely and is as such only made to keep the right for the movie modesty's history as a child is shown and is very true to the original the acting is perhaps not the best around and the plot is a bit thin but when you compare it to the 1966 vitti movie is way better just because it is not trying to be a musical generally would i only recommend it to fans of modesty blaise or to someone who by catch it on the tv,1
nothing new in this hackneyed romance with characters put into unbelievable situations speaking dialogue that borders on the ridiculous this is an example of another movie put into production before serious script problems were solved don't waste your time,0
though the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments it is a definitely incorrect assumption this is an adaptation of 9 seemingly unrelated stories from giovanni bocaccio's 14th century decameron story collection br br set within a medieval italian town's largely peasant population it is a diatribe on the reality of sex and its consequences within that world and time a realistic view of life within this world it sometimes feels like a journey back in time br br given the depicted human element of its time one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists as well as the ironies of life at times or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the catholic church's rules br br nothing terribly special but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions,0
i remember watching this on prime time when i was about 7 years old i was a huge comic book reader at the time and anything relating to superheroes was anticipated heavily the end result however was underwhelming br br i was aware of the emma peel diana prince stories as they had only recently come to an end and diana was returned to her amazonian form however there was so little action that i was bored throughout most of the movie the final costume was an interesting idea but looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero br br i saw the movie again in my late teen years it hadn't improved much cathy lee crosby was more familiar thanks to that's incredible but her acting was no better the script had a few good ideas like the rogue amazon and a decent villain in ricardo montalban but it just didn't come together and was still boring br br i think they should have built the back story better and built the show into a more epic climax it was too much like a bland spy film crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book the amazon elements were intriguing but needed to be expanded br br the film did succeed in forcing producers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something more faithful if a bit too camp and low budget the budget was also pretty low here and superheroes don't come cheap br br it would be nice to have the movie available on dvd if only as a comparison and historical document even superman 4 is available and it has nothing over this film except chris reeve and gene hackman it's worth seeing for curiosity sake and for a bit of inspiration and caution for future versions,0
it started out slow after an excellent animated intro as the director had a bunch of characters and school setting to develop once the bet is on though the movie picks up the pace as it's a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7 pm we had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son bullies helping others mind over matter when you don't want to do something br br of special note is the girl who played erica erk hallie kate eisenberg the director kinda sneaks her in unexpectedly and when she is on screen she is captivating she's one of those hey she looks familiar faces and then i remembered that she was the little girl that pepsi featured about 8 years ago she was also in paulie that movie about the parrot who tries to find his way home br br ms eisenberg made many tv and movie appearances in '99 00 but then was not seen much for the next few years she's now 14 and is growing up to be a beautiful woman her smile really warms up the screen if she can get some more good roles she could have as good a career or better than haley joel osment another three named kid actor but hopefully without some of the problems that osment has been in lately br br anywhozitz according to my 8 y o son who just finished reading the story the film did not seem to follow the book all that well but was entertaining none the less the ending of the film seemed like a big setup for some sequels how to eat boiled slugs escargot kid's style which might not be such a bad thing it was nice to take the family to a movie and not have to worry about language violence or sex scenes br br one other good aspect of the movie was the respect fear engendered by the principal mr burdock boilerplate movies nowadays tend to show adult authority figures as buffoons while he has one particular goofy scene he ruled the school with a firm hand it was also nice to see andrea martin getting some work,1
this would be a watchable hollywood mediocre if it had a good editing it relies on the typical american thriller plot who is going to outsmart everyone acting is below average but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises film was completely suffocated by blank video and sound shots and most of it looks like raw film material all in all if you don't mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project this is a film to watch i guess that would be enough to say on this film everything else could really spoil the tension that is probably low enough,0
i had just watched one episode of this program and i couldn't even get to the end of the program every minute i had watched this program my i q must of dropped about 10 points this is basically like a children's program but with swearing not even the swearing and the insults she tells other people made me laugh anyways the story must of been written by a monkey and the people who actually put this script for this program through for filming must of been held at gun point and had no choice but to film this retarded disappointing horribly acted program sarah silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some god damn acting lessons,0
this is one of those movies that's difficult to review without giving away the plot suffice to say there are weird things and unexpected twists going on beyond the initial superficial tom cruise screws around with multiple women plot br br the quality cast elevate this movie above the norm and all the cast are well suited to their parts cruise as the irritatingly smug playboy who has it all and then loses it all diaz as the attractive but slightly deranged jilted lover cruz as the exotic new girl on the scene and russell as the fatherly psychologist the story involves elements of romance morality murder mystery suspense and sci fi and is generally an entertaining trip br br i should add that the photography is also uniformly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful once you realize what's going on br br if you enjoy well acted movies with twists and suspense and are prepared to accept a slightly fantastic philip k dick style resolution then this is a must see br br 9 10,1
what an unusual movie br br absolutely no concessions are made to hollywood special effects or entertainment there is no background music not special effects or enhanced sound br br facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the spanish language is a strange monotonic lilt that sounds the same whether in the midst of a battle or talking around a campfire br br i sort of viewed these movies parts 1 and 2 as an educational experience not really something to go and get entertained by its quite long and in places dull br br but i suspect that given the lack of any plot development i don't think its very educational either br br its also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue it would be a good idea to read up a little on the history so that you can understand the context of what is happening since for some reason the director didn't see fit to inform the audience why che's band was moving around the way they did as a result there seem to be groups skulking around the woodland for no particular reason and getting shot at br br i would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing depth of character but somehow all of the characters were still strangers to me at the end the stars it gets are for realism and showing the hardships of guerrilla warfare,0
very good western this was the first time writer richard wilson directed a film also this was a first for samuel goldwyn junior as a producer it is a pleasure to see a very young and pretty angie dickinson as a saloon girl robert mitchum comes to this town dominated by outlaws and is hired as a town tamer but people are worried that he will go too far also about the harm that he will do to the town´s businesses there are some similarities in the story with warlock which was made in 1959 this film keeps a very fast and exciting pace it really keeps you on the edge,1
rosie wasted a lot of tv time talking about the tainos as if they were super influential in the dynamics of the modern day puerto rican they were not the truth is that the africans and the spanish were and she knows it what kills me is that she is standing on the screen looking like some average light skin black chick with an obvious black daddy cousins and auntie pretending to truly acknowledge the real essence of what makes them the modern day puerto ricans but barely mentioned how africans influenced the way their spanish is spoken the food and music she is so typical and i lost a lot of respect for her and will not support anything else she does also since she wants to dance around her african ness then she need not take more roles associated with blackness i e lackawanna blues we can find a prideful black latina next time thank you zoe saldana gina torres gina ravera and melissa desousa br br to the puerto rican on here that said they are african and not black thank you we blacks certainly do not have anything in common with you so there is no love lost but since you are probably in the states and have benefited from the civil rights movement we would like for you refuse any decent human treatment you received courtesy of the blood sweat and tears from the backs of the blacks you share nothing with br br if i am correct puerto ricans have a terrible image in the media but we blacks do not spend our time trying to disrespect you because we know that the media loves to exploits the low points and behaviors of all minorities to maintain mindless generalizations however you evidently have fed into the hype that one you are somehow white or superior you are not also you somehow feel compelled to believe that black culture is bet again you are incorrect and need to take a vacation out of the hood try visiting atlanta ga houston texas charlotte n c trust me none of those blacks want to claim your culture either,0
possible spoilers br br i like this film and have no problem staying awake for it it reminds me of me at 20 except this is even better like veronica says two chicks at one time it brings out the horniness in me the casual conversation these two real life chicks rather than hookers teasing us every step of the way i get into the conversations too even if they are utterly b s at times so what every chick just about that i've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous self centered b s philosophy it's just a bunch of nonsense and about as sensible as that other b s philosophy chicks are often into astrological charts the only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women he's into the same b s and moodiness the brunette chick is actually the most masculine person there br br i think it's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by veronica she'd love to pull the little blonde away from alexander but veronica plays her all the way she's brilliant she gets the brunette thinking there's something up between them and then she steals the boy child man which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group the brunette knows she's been had by the end when she's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while marlene deitrich sings in the background that paraphrasing there are a million couples in paris tonight but i only have this refrain br br but do they get married in the end alex and veronica mmmm i can only imagine a super tumultuous relationship ending in a pre marriage breakup they are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stones br br i like the film though it kept me entertained it's got a nice look and it's sexy,1
deep shock plays out like a tv movie a whole cast of commercial quality actors a poorly designed creature to be the bad guy and a script that is more full of technical political jargon and importances than it knows what to do with br br i checked out the movie because of the creature i love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos and right off the bat i got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie the actors i expected because of the type of film it is really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point the music was typical not thought out action symphonic music br br i liked the design of the computers and technical equipment along with the mini sub design the movie even flowed really well with guiding screens letting you know which set you're watching the story unfold in but there isn't much of a story here anyways br br this movie gets a 3 10 stars imo the boring search and destroy mission to blow up the north pole and these creatures protecting it kinda lame even lamer is the tagged on love relationship between two of the characters that you don't see coming chalk this one up to being a movie which tries to get actors' careers off the bench and into a video don't bother,0
that the bette davis version of this film was better than the kim novak version br br despite all of the other comments written here i really prefer the bette davis version even though the novak version has a more coherent story line br br however davis' mildred's raw emotions seem to me to be more apt to a sluttish girl who seems easily to become a prostitute br br and it is those raw emotions that constitute part of what the poor doctor falls in love with he has emotions of despair of failure of otherness strong emotions that he represses davis' mildred on the other hand displays her emotions immediately and without censure she has no feelings of despair or of failure or of otherness rather she is merely surviving as a poor cockney woman in the victorian era br br novak's portrayal was a more vulnerable mildred than was davis' almost through the the whole movie davis' mildred was never vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance and when he reviles her for her method of keeping body and soul together and for continually taking advantage of his love for her she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever seen on screen i wiped my mouth i wiped my mouth novak's vulnerability was excellent davis' realism was monumental br br imdb votes concur,1
scott menville is not casey kasem that is the first most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt at re imagining scooby doo and company br br shaggy's voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the scooby shows they've also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original br br i'm not sure what they're on about yet with the villain angle but it surely isn't following the formula used in any of the previous scooby shows br br and the animation style is very bizarre and distorted i like it but it's not real scooby doo type animation but the weird animation used for other wb shows grew on me this might too br br it's worth a glance at once if you can handle the lack of proper shaggy voice that right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly besides i am trying not to be an inflexible nitpicking fan evolve or die as the saying goes we'll see how it looks after two more episodes by then i'll have formed a much more solid opinion,0
this movie is so bad it can only be compared to the all time worst comedy police academy 7 no laughs throughout the movie do something worthwhile anything really just don't waste your time on this garbage,0
i was not expecting much from this movie but was very pleasantly surprised as it is light and funny and very well observed the central trio of deadbeat bikers were surprisingly likable as they staggered and clowned their way through their drug centred trip to wales the humour was gentle and subtle as indeed were the three characters witness their sympathetic treatment of the little old lady shopkeeper the atmospherics of rural wales were captured perfectly and the soundtrack was very well chosen cleverly and carefully scripted with great attention to detail i have never seen such a realistic portrayal of alternative culture i felt i was there with them very light in touch and full of fun not what you might expect from a movie about bikers and drugs a delight on all fronts and difficult to criticise though i thought the last two scenes were a bit lame the film should have ended when they left wales but overall an unexpected treasure of a film,1
i am a big fan of ludlum's work and of the covert one books and i had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film imagine my excitement then on learning that such a movie actually existed the 'hades factor' being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to start br br from the outset the film was disappointing simple elements from the film such as griffin's first meeting with smith are needlessly different from the book and much less exhilarating several characters are poorly cast too for starters dorff is woeful as smith not a bad actor just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of john smith br br re naming re assignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film for example the removal of victor tremont and the entire back story of the virus including the involvement of vaxham makes the entire point to the film somewhat hazy marty zellerbach is a very large part of the book and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book is another big mistake br br rachel russel is presumably supposed to be randi russel from the book not only is she supposed to be the sister of sophie amsden should be called sophia russel but she is also supposed to work from the cia not covert one which brings me to my final point and i think one of the most important covert one doesn't even exist at this point not until the second book of the series is covert one devised by the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorism br br to be honest i could go on all day in short if you like the books and want to see a good adaptation i'm afraid you'll be bitterly disappointed even as an action movie it is thoroughly average mainly due to very lack luster editing and poor effects the bumbled story line and dull as ditch water script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film,0
story of a wrongly executed prisoner who haunts the prison he was electrocuted in and kills random prisoners while waiting to take revenge on the man who framed him br br viggo mortensen is great and the acting is pretty good overall lane smith is deliciously wicked as the guilty warden also this film has some great gore including death by barbed wire mummification,1
i don't quite know how to explain darkend room because to summarize it wouldn't really do it justice it's a quintessentially lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange mysterious situation i would say this short is definitely more on the mulholland drive end of the lynchian spectrum as opposed to the elephant man or the straight story it's hidden on lynch's website and well worth the search,1
this is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the west indies and it stars puddy from the seinfeld show patrick warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he's noticeably slimmer here oliver reed got top billing but he's hardly in the film at all warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him eartha kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they're is so much nudity in the film if its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they're turn with him then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there's the bloody standoff no real political message like the film burn but just another contrived plot device to move the story along incredibly they made a sequel and warburton and all the rest of the cast came back i hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad the nudity keeps it watchable and warburton's lack of any accent make it at times laughable very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel,0
i'm afraid that you'll find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a 10 are highly christian i am not if you are looking for a christian movie i recommend this film if you are looking for a good general movie i'm afraid you'll need to go elsewhere br br i was annoyed by the characters and their illogical behaviour the premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong one scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal and then the character goes on to say that it was jesus who taught us this i find that offensive are we to believe that thou shalt not steal came from jesus i suppose he wrote the ten commandments and stealing was acceptable before that i rented the movie from netflix i should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments oh well,0
this is a dry and sterile feature filming on one of most interesting events in wwii and in history of warfare behind the front line bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event there is no character development at all and idea that tom cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and treason is completely insane i believe that mister bin would play it better generally speaking film pretty much looks as a cheep copy of good german tv movie stauffenberg from 2004 but can't get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever however movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop corn audience that cherishes hollywood fast mood blood and shallow art values,0
this movies is the best movie to watch for comic book feel the sets costumes and the color are just so vivid it is just like stepping into a comic book this is the movie i think of when the mob is mentioned the suits the hats and the attitudes br br hoffman gives comic relief as mumbles and you can't help but feel sorry for madonna as she tries and fails to win tracy over this movie contains all the classic mob clichés burying people in concrete blowing up peoples cars tieing up the good guy and attempting to blow up his girlfriends house br br this movie is a classic in ever sense of the word even camera angels cry out comic book its so great to be able to go back to an older movie and see that someone knew how a comic should be made into a movie after seeing such mistakes as spawn and the hulk br br you have to see this movie,1
the film maybe goes a little far but if you love the show it's what you expect it's not a bad movie it's actually pretty good if you don't like the show don't see the movie it starts off a little slow maybe but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny there are even a few heart wrenching scenes toward the end after all the protagonists have gone through these scences do get to you also jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his show's existience he's got a pretty good point we care so much about the private details of celebrities lives so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national tv too if they were celebrities we wouldn't mind at all we'd eat it up do we not like his guest doing this just because they're poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a leave it to beaver world,1
the championship game is only a couple of days away but things in new orleans aren't as they should be from players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable wonderful time can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined br br despite what you might think when you first read about superdome this is not a football movie in fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought instead superdome is another of those lousy soap opera ish 70s made for tv movies populated with hollywood has beens and those that never will be the cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good the best or worst example is van johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he's there the plot is dull uninteresting and unbelievable donna mills as a hit man yeah right it's about as believable as the affair she has with the liquor soaked david jansen the movie also lacks any pace trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow superdome might have had with no drama or suspense in sight superdome ends up being a very poor example of a 70s made for tv movie the lone highlight for me was the voice over work from the late charlie jones a sportscaster i miss listening to the eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and over hypes the atmosphere in new orleans is pure cheese at its finest br br like most others who have seen superdome i also did so courtesy of mystery science theater 3000 it may be one of the ktma public access episodes but it's one of the best examples of the shows early start so even though i've only rated superdome a 2 10 i'll give this episode a generous 3 5 on my mst3k rating scale,0
fidois a very odd film and in many ways a very good one br br my first thought after viewing was how the hell are they going to market this thing if shaun of the dead is a romantic comedy with zombies fido is a boy and his dog story blended with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies doesn't exactly trip off the tongue br br fido has little of shaun's carnage gore belly laughs it is a different beast altogether forgive the pun br br fido kicks off with a black white information film that explains the back story humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subdues the flesh eaters into dumb servants br br at first i thought we we were in for a fifties cold war paranoia parody a la matinée but we are soon hurled into a world of bright primary colours and fifties middle class nostalgia br br young timmy robinon is a lonely kid who doesn't fit in at school his mom is would be social climber and his dad is nervy and detached br br seeking to keep up with the joneses mom carry anne moss has acquired a zombie jimmy is disinterested at first but 'fido' billy conelley soon proves a great buddy for jimmy until his collar goes on the blink br br fido is not a horror film but my problem with the movie is figuring out exactly what it is br br much of the humour is of the light family variety and sometimes the plot line is too heavily reliant on the boy and his dog family moments br br yet the film is shot through with wonderfully dark truly funny moments which while welcome will ensure an r rating for what is for extended periods a family comedy br br the film looks gorgeous and is wonderfully performed by all involved br br despite its difficult tonal problems i hope this movie finds a niche as it's quite a little gem in this year's deluge of cinematic crap,1
as with most of eleanor powell's films this one plays out along the flimsiest of plots for some reason oh it is explained she's selected to transport a magnetic mine to cuba good guys and bad guys compete for the mine and who is who gets confusing but as always powell's dancing is superb and worth the price of admission and in this one lahr plays his cowardly lion evoking warm memories of that technicolor film of 1939 a fringe benefit is hearing a young frank with that wonderful voice and skinny vulnerability that he abandoned for his wise guy persona later on in addition the great drummer buddy rich has a wonderful time displaying his virtuosity watch particularly for his unique duet with dorsey's trumpet man ziggy elman i say unique perhaps in ignorance but i know of no other drum trumpet sequence like this one on film or records this film is fun even skelton's goofy persona is relatively restrained powell shows again that she is the greatest film dancer ever,1
i have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie i guess i must have missed something the beginning is intriguing the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories that's the best part after the three go their separate ways the film splits into three threads that's when boredom sets in certainly the thread with the felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity unfortunately the director beat this one to death even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular bottom line a two hour plot thin listlessness if you suffer from insomnia view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep,0
if ashanti had been a serious attempt at a film about the institution of slavery still prevalent in third world countries the film might have been better received instead it turns into a star studded disaster of a movie where the stars came in said their lines and picked up their paychecks without much conviction br br michael caine and his wife beverly johnson work for the united nations world health organization and are busy doing their humanitarian thing in east africa along comes peter ustinov who can barely summon enough ham in him to make a go of the part as a moslem slave dealer as johnson is black he grabs her anyway along with a lot of children and a few adults as well br br of course caine doesn't take kindly to the kidnapping and the rest of the film is spent in a rescue attempt the rest of the cast has such folks as william holden rex harrison omar sharif and indian film star kebir bedi in parts and looking so incredibly bored with the whole thing br br usually in something like this talented people like those mentioned above will just overact outrageously and feast on a diet of scenery but ashanti doesn't even have that going for it br br what an incredible waste of time the aroma of tax write off is permeating the air,0
house of games is a flawlessly constructed film and one of the few films i have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends i first saw it on video a few years back after reading roger ebert's review which proclaimed it the best film of 1987 i had my doubts mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year boy was i in for a surprise this was one of the smartest most well written movies i had ever seen br br the screenplay is quite a piece of work not only in terms of the plot which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out but also in terms of character development on my second viewing i began to realize that mamet's screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations the climax of the movie is particularly effective because it is absolutely inevitable it stems naturally from what we know about the characters and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending the performances by lindsay crouse and joe mantegna also add enormously to the film i cannot picture any other actor besides mantegna playing the role of mike and crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset their work plus mamet's extraordinary screenplay combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980's it is truly a must see,1
the rumor is true girls like coyote ugly more than guys and the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given jersey girl goes to new york to become a song writer and after initial frustration of having no luck overhears some girls partying about the 300 each they made last night she gets an audition at the bar they work at and surprise the place is completely full of two year old toddlers bursting at the sight of babes dancing br br the story is not bad and some characters are likeable especially cammie the fashion coordinator part was cute and the bouncer but let's face it the drama was horrible and completely laughable from the beginning violet and her father looked far too ridiculous while they were relating throughout the movie and check out violet too jamming on that keyboard with the break dancer br br for the first time i could think of how could the production be so terrible for a brief moment with this movie hollywood could stand on its two feet and show a new low without any major public outcry without saying you were warned instead it seems coyote ugly has a purposeful intent on trying to kiss every major rear in the world advertising babes in a bar but showing a paper thin pursue your dream story disappointed every male teen you targeted br br and finally the music there was absolutely no break of music i found in this movie especially when it was needed the hospital scene every scene felt like some short music video you just wish would stop until the bar opened but the climax was an ultimate laugher an '80s like song you would expect cyndi lauper to jump on the stage and jam with violet heck i personally thought bon jovi was going to jump out with the long hair and jam too br br other than some really smart camera work with the coyote girls when dancing especially the wet scene and a couple cute cliches coyote ugly is something to be purely embarrassed about whether you watched or made it it looked like nothing but time killing or wasting depending on how you look at it,0
can i please say first of all that i felt so strongly about this movie that i signed up to imdb specifically to review it and my review this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen br br the synopsis of the movie sounded interesting nazis occult time travel etc but the movies plot failed to properly bring all these elements together remember the episode of south park that featured manatees writing family guy using 'idea balls' did these manatees also write unholy its like the writer wanted to include all these different ideas but had no idea how to link them all together and then to make things make even less sense included a donnie darko esquire time travel theme to the ending messing up the chronology br br i could tell from early on that this was a bad movie special effects were too low budget for anything better than straight to dvd the acting wasn't great but in fairness i've seen worse i will praise the nazi paintings they were creepy but the evil nazi butcher guy was just comic br br i don't have a vendetta against this movie or anything but to be honest i'm not even into the horror genre but this movie cannot be described as a thriller or a drama if this story had been well told this would have been a good movie but it has been over hyped waaaaay over hyped,0

shintarô katsu gained tons of fame playing the wonderful character zatoichi the zatoichi films had a weird and unbelievable concept a blind guy is the greatest swordsman in japan and spends each movie righting wrongs and exacting retribution on evil doers he's a heck of a nice guy and the films are exciting and addictive i've actually seen every movie it is because of this i saw this final installment of the hanzo the razor series as i assumed it would be very similar and boy was i wrong it turns out that the hanzo films are extremely sexual in nature and they also promote the rape of women who deserve it you see hanzo is a policeman from the meiji period and he regularly takes evil women into custody and interrogates them by violently raping them with his penis of steel how he made his member so strong is something you have to see to believe but it certainly is not for the squeamish br br overall i just can't recommend anyone sees these violent and misogynistic films however from looking at the other reviews i can see that they are still very popular and that is pretty scary despite some decent acting and amazing fight scenes the films just are like brain pollution and i'd hate to imagine how the films might have contributed to violence towards women,0
now i love american pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for seann william scott's performance as stifler but after that the quality has dropped band camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but naked mile was the same joke and plot lines recycled erik stifler's sex problem is like jim's it had some amusing moments like the football game against the midgets and the 'punishment' of coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the 'mile' was just stupid and moronic not to mention the irritating girlfriend who doesn't want to have sex br br anyway enough about the naked mile i watched beta house with apprehension as i thought it could take the series to a new low but i was pleasantly surprised to be honest there is no real plot but it's filled with hot girls ashley is incredible and sex jokes aplenty yes it is formulaic and the jokes are old but dwight stifler steve talley raises the bar with an exuberant performance the greek olympiad is entertaining especially the penultimate and final events while christopher mcdonald's cameo is hilarious there are weak points though coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first i'm still baffled to as how he ever got a part br br while coozeman is bad erik stifler is worse john white made naked mile a pain to watch but in beta house he takes his performance to a whole new low first and foremost he lacks charisma a stifler prerequisite you really can't care less about him the only reason i was bothered about his relationship was so ashley could be on screen she shines above him as does the rest of the cast seriously john white is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish br br saying that the film does entertain and coozeman's fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny br br overall this film is worth renting get a few of your mates in and have a laugh at the vomit fest event and vent your anger at erik 'loser' stifler,1
it's nice to see a film with real people with honest feelings sissy spacek is so absolutely convincing as a simple yet nice daughter to robert farnsworth br br who finally in his last role gets to show what a fine actor he was it is hard to believe that this is a david lynch film it is slow and even sweet and moving one of the best unless you like car chases sex scenes and violence,1
anyone who's watched a few lifetime movie network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing that gets brushed off the planning table so when crazed lara moves into patti's home and methodically begins to drive her landlady bonkers i didn't even blink when lara eventually ramps up her activities to threatening poor patti and dares her to do anything about it i just nodded you see on planet lmn people don't behave the way they do for any particular reason they just do it to keep the action going only on planet lmn could someone almost have the owner of a home thrown out of their own house by means of their seductive powers poor patti she just trusted too much and lara went off her medicine and then there was this big fight at the top of the stairs involving a syringe full of deadly stuff that ends up injected into someone's tummy and a body bag going out the front door the horror br br but take it from me this planet lmn product is a classic you need to watch it once just for the great laughs you'll have on the improbability scale i give this film a 95 100 make a big batch of popcorn and get some apple slices too you'll understand later,0

gandhi my father is like viewing a book chapter by chapter you read it with your eyes and you learn more about harilal gandhi and for that matter kasturba gandhi so little is known about both of them and this movie describes them uniquely the title misleads though its as much a movie about mohandas karamchand gandhi and his son as its about harilal and his mother and akshaye khanna and shefali chayya do full justice to their respective roles br br such movies are like leap years they come after only so much time br br gandhi my father is also about an internal struggle which is sometimes more difficult than any freedom struggle ever undertaken br br watch it if you like quality cinema,1
falls into the film category of way too ridiculous in the dialogue and execution departments to be taken seriously whereas shriek if you know what i did last friday the thirteenth or my boyfriend's back know they are bad scarecrows doesn't evil dead set such a high standard for the comedic horror on a budget genre that scarecrows is simply out of place br br suspicions of inexperience are immediately at play as there are no hints of noise or vibration in the hull and cockpit of an airborne plane the repeated display of a picture of 3 men just screams for a story arc but nothing comes although the men are obviously the scarecrows there is no explanation br br knowing this film is too serious for it's own good may produce some grins i don't recall if joe bob briggs ever previewed scarecrows but i believe that he wouldn't stoop this low however with an imdb rating of over 6 there are many people that disagree,0
what a terrible film br br it starts well with the title sequence but that's about as good as it gets br br the movie is something about rats turning into monsters and going on a killing spree the acting isn't so much poor but the script is pointless and the film isn't even scary despite the atmospheric music br br it really is amazing that some group cobbled together this bag of rubbish and thought it would make a good film br br it isn't a good film it's trash and i urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it one out of ten,0
the running man along with total recall is my favorite schwarzenegger movie no this isn't 2001 but it's not meant to be and the acting and script here isn't even up to par with other arnie movies like predator or the terminator but i submit that the idea behind this movie is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen a state sponsored game show in which criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against heroic stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons the runners are equipped with none in order to satisfy the public's lust for sport and blood the ultimate prize for a winning runner freedom or so the rules claim br br for a movie with such over the top gory death scenes and cheesy one liners it really does have a lot to say someone else has pointed out all the commentary on culture government presented in this movie so i won't go into it here suffice it to say that if you can look beyond the seemingly silly feel of the movie you will enjoy it very much especially if you're a big sf fan with a lot of imagination like i said it's not trying to be a serious art film but it is surprisingly layered for a 80s shoot em up flick the premise is borrowed from a richard bachman aka stephen king short novel but diverges fairly strongly from its source material especially towards the end the book ends rather nihilistically needless to say this movie doesn't i enjoyed both but i like the movie better br br my favorite line guess it's caused from steroids,1
the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly shemp moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team br br this is a good three stooges short it funny and its cast includes christine mcintyre symona boniface gino corrado fred kelsey sam flint chester conklin theodore lorch lynton brent judy malcolm vernon dent john tyrrell heinie conklin and bess flowers the stooges performed very well in this short i recommend this one,1
actually my vote is a 7 5 anyway the movie was good it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it don't misunderstand me is not the funniest movie of the world and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies but this one has its own taste a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends i think that not exactly but who cares also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic chris rock appears in it the name is down to earth men that one its a very funny movie see both if you want and i know that you will agree that mr rock won with his movie i would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ashton kutcher however the film is good,1
although the movie takes place at an ivy league college it was in fact shot entirely in northern arizona mostly at northern arizona university in flagstaff in the fall of 1976 i was involved in the theater department there and most of the extras in the film are then members of the theater department br br there is an absolutely ludicrous scene in this film if you know your arizona geography that shows several cast members riding bikes from the college to a creek we nau'ers know that the campus and said creek actually oak creek canyon are about 35 miles apart and while the trip there is all downhill it would be literally impossible to ride a bike back up that same road,0
what a terrible terrible film one of the worst movies i have seen in my life i usually love movies like this the whole a guy meets an eccentric woman who he likes but he happens to already be involved with someone who not right for him i expected something predictable and i didn't mind the movies are always entertaining mixing the right amount of romance with comedy but not this one every single joke falls flat and the romance makes me want to vomit the title character is one of the most please kill me characters that i have ever witnessed on my television the eccentric woman isn't very eccentric more like quirky and annoying the other someone is the most reasonable mature person in this film but also happens to be just as annoying this films flat out sucks there's no way around it don't waste your time,0

much of over her dead body is so painfully unfunny that i was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors br br eva longoria proves that she can't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy and further that she doesn't really even have any comedic timing she's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fiancé the fiancé is played by paul rudd drippy and charmless while the psychic is played by lake bell bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has i felt most sorry for bell as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work unfortunately she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features jason biggs tolerable and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like leo dicaprio at the end of titanic br br over her dead body actually pi ed me off because of its laziness and utter lack of effort i started to think of all the interesting projects that can't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this seriously does hollywood think movies like this are good enough how stupid do they really think the movie going public is br br grade f,0
when i'd seen the name of this movie i'd always thought it was a musical like the harvey girls it's not it's a pudding that overcooked hit the kitchen ceiling and was pried off and cobbled together no music and not a period piece but thoroughly improbable br br it starts with patriarch james woods telling the eldest of his three daughters a small child who grows to be barbara stanwyck that she must maintain the family name and home br br we thus think it is going to be a historical intergenerational tale and it is for a brief time then it turns into the story of cold hearted stanwyck's fight against lawyer george brent why is she so dead set against him well why else as we learn in a strange flashback sequence narrated by stanwyck she had once thought she could inherit some money for her sisters as well as herself of course by marrying she hit on someone she took to be a country bumpkin who was in fact budding lawyer brent br br lest anyone think the child they had a young man of eight or so at the time of the main plot is well you know they had a hasty marriage and during the very short time they were together he was conceived br br one of her sisters is in love with a painter named gig young who is played by gig young the other sister tries to take him away etc etc br br it is a shrill unengaging mess well enough acted but without a shred of logic or plausibility,0

this review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based br br the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society but according to fred schepisi's partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous australian murder trial it was not granted to lindy chamberlain accused of killing her baby the story suggesting her innocence was unlikely a dingo was alleged to have taken it but those implying her guilt even more so and there was no solid evidence against her but the australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt and the deeply religious chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media and the media themselves of course were anything but innocent in this process so although cleared by an initial inquest they were later prosecuted and convicted although chamberlain was eventually released this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence proving their innocence something no defendants should have to produce br br 'a cry in the dark' is well acted throughout especially by meryl streep who puts on a convincing australian accent at least to this pom's ears and manages keep lindy sympathetic to us while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure the scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking because we believe in the characters as real br br regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story something i can't comment on the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the british popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readership's least charitable instincts no legal system will ever be perfect but the current cry against asylum seekers in contemporary british tabloids comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put lindy chamberlain away i'm not a religious man but the bible still contains some killer lines if you'll excuse the pun judge not lest ye be judged is one of them,1

this movie is well done on so many levels that i am in awe that the score is as low as it is 5 9 10 576 votes as of this writing this movie has incredible special effects a true epic storyline complex great character interaction and mind blowing battles they have to be seen to be believed the only complaint i have is the subtitles on the hk dvd version i got some lines were not translated br br i just don't understand when i read hear from various sources it has a confusing plot i couldn't follow the story or characters came from nowhere from the very 1st time i watched this movie i understood it followed it knew why characters were there and i absolutely loved it i've watched it about 8 times already and each time it is pure enjoyment oh and this is not just my opinion because i've shown this movie to many fellow americans people who have never seen an hk film before who feel the same way not one of them failed to follow the storyline and each person declared their love for this movie oh man why can't we have stuff like this coming out of hollywood at least lord of the rings had a nice marriage of special effects character development and storyline br br this is not coming from a asian film lover newbie either i own an extensive library of asian films and i must say that this movie is one of my greatest dvds when you watch it you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie you will be drawn into this fantasy world and you won't want to leave i've seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 both done by tsui hark and the 2001 is far better in comparison imo br br besides the subtitles i have one additional complaint about this movie i didn't want it to end i'm begging you mr hark can we please have a sequel,1
the original with barbara stanwyk is saved only by stanwyk's performance the story and the other performances are too sickeningly sweet and the film itself is too dated to be really enjoyed today bette midler's version is much more interesting she is stella claire an independent free spirited single woman who gets pregnant and refuses help from her boyfriend stephen collins or her friend john goodman in an underrated performance she raises her daughter jenny played so sweetly by trini alvarado and then comes to the conclusion that jenny's father can do better for her and ultimately makes a life altering decision through out the film there are plenty of laughs tears and memorable moments mostly between midler and alvarado marsha mason co stars as jenny's would be stepmother who though wealthy turns out to be a very good influence on her if you like midler goodman or just good films with plenty of emotion you'll enjoy bette midler's version of stella,1
gino costa massimo girotti is a young and handsome drifter who arrives in a road bar he meets the young beautiful and unsatisfied wife giovanna bragana clara calamai and her old and fat husband giuseppe bragana juan de landa owners of the bar he trades his mechanical skills by some food and lodging and has an affair with giovanna they both decide to kill giuseppe forging a car accident the relationship of them become affect by the feeling of guilty and the investigation of the police this masterpiece ends in a tragic way the noir and neo realistic movie of luchino visconti is outstanding this is the first time that i watch this version of the postman always rings twice' i loved the 1946 version with lana turner and the 1981 version where jack nicholson and jessica lange have one of the hottest sex scene in the history of the cinema but this one is certainly the best my vote is ten,1
in the same tune as his americana drums along the mohawk john ford captures american history in a way that is fictional yet very believable henry fonda made three consecutive films in this era with ford and all three are about a certain time and place with emphasis on the setting and the cultural surroundings in mohawk pioneer america is in full bloom with americans fending for themselves against indians and other forces here ford shows us 19th century america a time when invention and creativity were beginning to blossom and this nation truly was becoming great amongst it all was a tall lanky young lawyer from illinois named abe lincoln and this film fictionalizes his life as a lawyer foreshadowing the greatness he would later accomplish br br fonda is superb in this movie capturing the essence of what is considered to be the persona of lincoln although no one knows exactly what he was like then the sets and supporting cast also work well together and give a unique balance in ford's picturesque of the american dream and its many forms this is not a film to be taken literally but rather symbolically showing that lincoln was indeed warming up for the events in his life that were to creates his legacy we even get some scenes between him and a young mary todd and it is hard to see how they did end up together but that is not the point i believe this is simply a tribute to the greatness of lincoln widely regarded as the greatest american president his quiet and straightforward demeanor was rare then and would be today indeed our government surely needs more men like him,1
hubert selby jr gave us the book requiem for a dream and co wrote the screenplay to aronofsky's movie of it that movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the vices that destroyed them last exit to brooklyn still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives but it hardly does them the same justice aronofsky did br br the film seems laughably anti gay at times especially when in the film homosexuality equals death one gay character gets stoned is launched skyward by a speeding car and lands dead on the pavement another is crucified and still more are simply beat up another exaggerated piece of shock value that might actually have been compelling if it were done well are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strike breakers who'd have thought a drama about brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosions br br the director uli edel has a skill level like that of a tv director but he is far below the cut for real movies the film is clunky that can't even seem to settle on a genre lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part and then comes jennifer jason leigh as our lead a loathsome hooker named tralala believe it or not i'm not joking her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper than it is and also takes the real edge off the more provocative bits a failure,0
ask yourself where she got the gun remember what she was taught about the mark's mindset when the con is over the gun had blanks and it was provided to her from the very beginning br br when the patient comes back at the end she was supposed to see him drive away in the red convertible and lead her to the gang splitting up her 80 thousand br br the patient was in on the con from the beginning br br mantegna does not die in the end the gun had blanks br br there enough spoilers for you there this is why people are giving it such high ratings it's extremely original because of the hidden ending and how it cons most of the audience,1
could this be by the same director as don't look now or bad timing poorly br br acted clunkily edited you only have to compare the various accident scenes in this with similar ones in don't look now to see how much roeg has lost his br br touch br br even the generally reliable teresa russell looking a bit chunky these days i'm afraid to report cannot save this one the plot is pure pseudo religious hokum the acting is wooden and roeg's attempts at his trademark dislocation of time are pitiful br br avoid this one like the plague,0
i usually read reviews before i watch a movie guess what i didn't do that before watching tlb and i have to say i was very surprised to see the above average rating at imdb i found it to have a total lack of story you just get dropped into it and sadly not in the way saving private ryan dropped us into the movie and it also has a sudden end which was very unsatisfying for me br br i have to admit the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me especially with the low budget in mind but prepare yourself to have a laugh some guys are being tossed through the air after an explosion as if they are olympic gymnasts a mid air corkscrew or somersault during ww i is a bit too much for me especially when it's performed countless times during the movie br br but the parts that really got me laughing until i almost cried were the scenes containing close combat the screaming and shouting german voices unbelievably funny it seems as if they are spoken by one single actor voice performer because they all sound exactly the same and it just sounds like a 'typical' german voice br br i would absolutely not recommend this movie to anyone except to people who just want to have some laughs because of the sad and corny quality of it,0
1st watched 2 28 2006 4 out of 10 dir sydney pollack dvd version i watched titled 3 days of the condor so so cia drama full of laid back performances making for a very laid back movie the premise of the story revolves around 7 out of 8 members of a cia research group being killed with robert redford's character codename condor being the one that was left who killed them and why that's what redford tries to find out while trying to not be the 8th victim at the same time along the way he gets faye dunaway's character involved involved originally because he needs a place to hide and then she eventually helps him out after a little lovey dovey time this is one of a handful of innocent guy on the run stories but this one doesn't have a lot of suspense the flat performances don't help and the finish doesn't seal the deal for the audience enough either despite having a good director in sydney pollack and a group of classic performers the story and the performances are not what they should be and therefore the movie is not what it should be,0
i've read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to see it on dvd to be honest i really don't know what the problem with it is br br it's a decent murder mystery thriller shown from various points of view from an eccentric cast of often drugged out potential killers suspects including the late porn king john holmes please read the plot synopsis for the exact details of the movie's plot i wish to contribute more to a review than a synopsis br br many reviewers went so far to give this movie their lowest rating due to violence but i really don't see it many modern movies were worse saving private ryan was ultimately more violent than this movie which often relies on implied blood stains than actual brutal slayings the murders depicted in this film were done with lead pipes afterall br br i was enthralled with both halves of the movie the first showing john holmes as a hopeless cash hungry drug addict and the second half showing his side as a minor conspirator in a senseless bloodbath the movie has excellent acting even though dylan mcdemorant looks more than a bit out of place in his biker esque personia and goatee'ed bad boy personality br br the soundtrack was also awesome a fantastic mix of 70's b side rock and obscure pop spread out over a couple of hours in all the right places ala boogie nights,1
was flipping around the tv and hbo was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions so i turned to my twin sister and said hey this looks like fun truly i love documentaries so we started watching it at first i thought jonni kennedy was a young man but then it was explained that due to his condition he never went through puberty thus the high voice and smaller body he was on a crusade to raise money for his cause he had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality i cried watched some more laughed got up to get another kleenex then cried some more once jonni kennedy's time was up he flew to heaven to be with the angels he was more than ready he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free i highly recommend this if you do not fall in love with this guy you have no heart,1

br br once i ignored some of the implausibilities this was actually a fairly decent horror monster flick so i'll give some of the good points first the dragon was quite convincing especially as she prowled through the tunnels looking for lunch hint she likes humans the action was fairly non stop and after a weak beginning i got quite absorbed in the storyline sorry to say i was kind of rooting for the dragon she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the movie br br now for the implausible stuff maybe some spoilers if you were hunting a fire breathing dragon in 1100 ad would you charge into its cave with a barrel of gunpowder under your arm duh a female character with an all american name blonde hair and obvious slavic accent trying to pretend she's spanish huh a lead scientist whose slavic accent you can cut with a knife and he's supposedly born in chicago educated in usa a military helicopter pilot who does his own repairs flies a huge transport copter with no other crew and is an expert marksman and combat soldier to boot ok uh huh i won't even mention his giving 3 different call signs in 2 minutes while communicating with his base br br it's still better than some of the japanese monster flicks from the 60's but not by much if we're lucky we won't see dragon fighter 2 though naturally the ending left that possibility wide open or maybe they'll hire a real director next time br br in spite of everything i gave this flick a 4 out of 10 add 2 more if they rewrite the plot and dean cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes grin,0
as usual hollywood stereotyped everyone in the movie but this one is a classic from the uptight white collar banker to the russian woman well done even facial expressions were great language was perfect even in russian language and nicole did a splendid job hey guys you get what you pay for,1
the bloodsucker leads the dance what a laughable title it's so utterly misleading it's not surprising that the film makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie br br the story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island br br very little happens in this film and when something does wake the viewer from his stupor it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice artists these guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remedial level morons it really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal but the voice artists cannot be blamed for the script it's a travesty unintentionally funny at best pathetic at worst the story in general is to say the least uneven the women characters are particularly idiotic the men are either creepy or tedious br br the whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience it doesn't remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders finally start happening they all occur off screen all we get is a few half hearted severed head shots br br a few people have said that this movie is a giallo i cannot agree less with this opinion anyone who enjoys italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it it's basically a soft core porn film with a horror angle but it's not very erotic either br br i can't recommend this to anyone,0
i'm allowed to write 1000 words about this film but one word could suffice bizarre hubby and i didn't laugh so much as gawk at this truly dreadful movie we kept looking at each other with our best what the expressions there is no way to adequately describe this movie killer tomatoes were funny but this is just sick what kind of mind produces images like these and then puts them on film for others to see what kind of mind includes innocent children in this weird weird movie and then packages it as if it is appropriate for children parents whatever you do if your child still believes in santa don't let him her see this movie preteens can watch it probably with what the expressions on their faces if you decide to inflict this movie on others you might want to spike their eggnog br br quite possibly the worst film ever made,0
my commentary has nothing to do with the political sentiments found in the film in fact they're quite congruent with mine what gets me is the fact that in terms of a movie it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of story motive or dialogue maybe someone should tell neal that substituting lyrics of songs which are failing to inspire anyone outside of a dwindling audience isn't the same thing as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or director a silly narrative remains as such despite the iconic legacy of neal young the most childish scene is the one where the devil dances his way into a bar slips a tonic to an unsuspecting hero who then finds his way onto the dance floor to mouth the words to young song to the heroine who is unaware of what's taken place somehow these two dream up a scheme where they will go up the west coast in search of sorry neal stick with music and leave film making to steven stills,0
this film is terrible the characters are completely unbelievable and wildly inconsistent the plot is awful and some of the classroom scenes are cringe worthy and make for uncomfortable viewing br br in fact the quality of the script and characterisation would suggest that this film was written by high school students only the utter lack of credibility to the school environment would suggest that in fact the writers probably never went to high school the acting in most cases was weak too although a lot of this was down to a poor script and plot i am not sure that any actors could have made this film watchable br br having said that the sound track was ok and the cinematography was nice in places although the editing was poor,0
'soapdish' is one of the best yet least well remembered comedies of the 1990's the film revolves around the various off camera drama's that occur behind the scenes of a cheaply produced daytime soap opera the first of the film's various impressive strengths is it's fantastic a list cast 'soapdish' features some of the greatest actors and actresses of it's era br br the film is superbly led by sally field as the neurotic ageing actress celeste talbert she famously throws a tantrum when put in a costume that makes her look like gloria f cking swanson her supporting cast reads like a who's who of 90's movie greats whoopi goldberg robert downey jr teri hatcher kevin kline and kathy najimy all elevate the film greatly goldberg is predictably excellent whilst downey jr 's and hatcher's performances hint at the comedic excellence they would later achieve br br in terms of writing the film is outstanding there is a really modern edge to the script which strays into the wonderfully bizarre on several occasions there also several visual gags that are quite ahead of their time in some ways the film is reminiscent of mel brooks at his best and frequently reminded this reviewer of 'high anxiety' 1977 much of the film's humour hinges on it's often scathing but pretty accurate representations of daytime television and of neurotic and pretentious actors for example the extras casting session featuring the exploitative executive played by carrie fisher is both hilarious and honest br br 'soapdish' is for my money one of the very best comedies hollywood produced during the 1990's it's excellent script and a class cast make it a must see it's hard not to love this film after it's kept you laughing for 90 minutes,1
this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen but i really can't recall when i've seen a worse one i thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation what it really was is a soap opera and a bad one at that they overplayed the 'conflict' card to the extreme the first hour or so seems like a shouting match with some implausible scenes thrown in br br possible spoiler br br the 40 or so minute 'memorial' scene with requisite black umbrellas and rain to fictitious crash victims was lame and i thought it would never end br br avoid this one at all costs unless you revel in 'conflict' br br,0
barbara streisand directs and stars in this very jewish story br br to have a chance at obtaining an education babs enthusiastically disguises herself as a boy which isn't the most difficult thing to do since she already looks like a boy anyway at her new school she meets many male classmates who have no trouble at all in believing she's a guy br br don't miss the best of many moments of unintentional humor when babs' male friend thinks she's a man but pins 'him' to the ground sits on top of 'him' and looks affectionately into 'his' eyes snicker br br mediocre film splashy story about nothing particularly interesting,0

we all know a movie never does complete justice to the book but this is exceptional important characters were cut out blanca and alba were essentially mushed into the same character most of the subplots and major elements of the main plot were eliminated clara's clairvoyance was extremely downplayed making her seem like a much more shallow character than the one i got to know in the book in the book we learn more about her powers and the important effects she had on so many people which in turn was a key element in the life of the family in the movie she was no more than some special lady the relationship between esteban and pedro tercero tercero third by the way is the son and thus comes after segundo second and its connections to that between esteban and his grandson from pancha garcía not son who he also did recognize is chopped in half and its importance downplayed br br one of the most fundamental things about the book that the film is all but stripped of this is called the house of the spirits where is the house the story of 3 4 generations of a family is supposed to revolve around the big house on the corner a line stated so many times in the novel the house in fundamental to the story but the movie unjustly relegates it to a mere backdrop br br if i hadn't read the book before i would have never guessed that such a sappy shallow movie could be based on such a rich and entertaining novel,0
this is a film not porn br br this is a wonderful film full of tender moments and memories a beautiful piece of work excellent for intelligent viewers only br br if you are a film lover a romantic a person who has loved deeply this is your film br br it has a beautiful surreal quality fine acting and directing watching this film made me remember my first love br br thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life love and the meaning of loss br br highly recommended for all film lovers,1
this was a great movie with a good cast all of them hitting on all cylinders and when dianne keaton is at her best well it just doesn't get any better than that but tom everett scott always underrated was even better he should be a star br br my only complaint is with one aspect of the screenplay none of the characters ever acknowledged that the dead daughter wasn't always a good person and neither was her mother played by keaton at one point she breaks a promise she made to one character not to reveal that he had been sleeping around br br one of the other commentators said the movie had a political agenda that is a baffling thing to say there was no politics at all in this movie,1
this movie is bad it's basically an overdone copy of michael jackson's thriller video only worse the special effects consist of lots of glow in the dark paint freaky slapstick fastmoving camera shots and lots of growling i think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie,0
hold your man finds jean harlow working class girl from brooklyn falling for con man clark gable and getting in all kinds of trouble the film starts out as his film but by the time it's over the emphasis definitely switches to her character br br the film opens with gable pulling a street con game with partner garry owen and the mark yelling for the cops as he's being chased gable ducks into harlow's apartment and being he's such a charming fellow she shields him br br before long she's involved with him and unfortunately with his rackets gable harlow and owen try pulling a badger game on a drunken paul hurst but then gable won't go through with it of course when hurst realizes it was a con he's still sore and gets belligerent and gable has to punch him out but then he winds up dead outside harlow's apartment and that platinum blond hair makes her easy to identify she goes up on an accomplice to manslaughter br br the rest of the film is her's and her adjustment to prison life her interaction with the other female prisoners give her some very good scenes i think some of the material was later used for the mgm classic caged br br harlow also gets to do the title song and it's done as torch style ballad very popular back in those days she talk sings it in the manner of sophie tucker and quite well br br gable is well cast as the con man who develops a conscience a part he'd play often most notably in my favorite gable film honky tonk br br still it's harlow who gets to shine in this film i think it's one of the best she did at mgm her fans should not miss it,1
this was a rip off of the same garbage we had to watch bob saget host during the half hour before this dave coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as america's funniest home videos except with a hosts who have a combined iq of three tawny kitaen must've really needed the money and coulier had to go to the recycle bin for his jokes it was torture enough having to see him imitate popeye and other washed up cartoon starts on full house that one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a grade a wedgie coulier must've needed to money to please alannis morisette while they were dating,0
this could be difficult to for some people to get into being used to hollywood production styles the directing is uninspired apparently simply a filming of the stage set up and the audio quality is bad here and there the rustling of people's clothes occasionally competes with their voices etc br br my friends and i started watching without knowing what to expect and the first scene almost put us off it seemed very stagy and cheesy then we picked up on the tone of the content and really started to enjoy ourselves br br it is very funny despite some corniness definitely give it a chance if you appreciate great dialog also helena bonham carter is adorable of course,1
even when i saw this movie at a teenager i wondered just how ironic it was that pia zadora starred in a movie about an artist who slept her way to the top as beautiful and sexy as ms zadora is even she couldn't keep this sorry ass excuse of a movie from tanking not even her photoshoot for penthouse in which the lonely lady was promoted back in the day could keep this movie from tanking the only thing that could have saved this movie a completely different script give this one a miss,0
i have not read the other comments on the film but judging from the average rating i can see that they are unlikely to be very complementary br br i watched it for the second time with my children they absolutely loved it true it did not have the adults rolling around the floor but the sound of the children's enjoyment made it seem so br br it is a true mel brooks farce with plenty of moral content how sad it is to be loved for our money not for whom we are and how fickle are our friends and associates there are many other films on a similar subject matter no doubt many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults it's hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family however br br hence for the children a 9 10 from me,1
i saw this film on true movies which automatically made me sceptical but actually it was good why not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue of which there is little but because actually despite what people say i thought the film was accurate in it's depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancy br br it's not dawson's creek they're not graceful cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge they're kids and they act like kids would br br they're blunt awkward and annoyingly confused about everything yes this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but i don't think so dermot mulroney gives when not trying to be cool a very believable performance and i loved him for it patricia arquette is whiny and annoying but she was pregnant and a teenagers the combination of the two isn't exactly lavender on your pillow the plot was very predictable and but so what i believed them his stress and inability to cope her brave yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together i think the characters acted by anyone else would indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they weren't it reflects the surreality of the situation they're in that he's sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby i felt angry at her for that i felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her i felt it all br br in the end i loved it and would recommend it br br watch out for the scene where dermot mulroney runs from the disastrous counselling session career performance,1
kudos to director and cast for such a realistic film the grittiness lack of glamor and desperation drew me into the film and kept me there i was truly impressed by how dates and information were relayed within the film ie newspapers letters etc it kept the film moving at such a fast pace i didn't feel the urge to fast forward once personally i thought all the principles did a tremendous job it was great to see bosworth and kudrow in such difficult roles it made me want to cry at times val kilmer didn't surprise me his performances of this nature usually leave me in awe overall this is a brilliant film not to be missed,1
there isn't much to say about this film it is horrible br br the acting and dialog are way far away from even decent the story of the hybrid werewolf's is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there br br cgi is something you wouldn't like to see it so amateurish that it makes me vomit br br the only good thing on the dvd was in the extras the gag reel everything else just waste of time and money i hope noone will buy this this is not even worth renting br br just stay away of this,0
as i understand it after the chinese took over hong kong the infamous cat 3 hong kong movies kind of disappeared at least until now and what an amazing movie this one is i knew it was a rough crime drama going in but being the first cat 3 i've purchased that's been made recently i wasn't sure what to expect br br a cambodian hit man goes to hong kong to knock off the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer turns out the judge made the arrangements for the hit man because she was divorcing the judge and threatening to take all his money this is all known within the first ten minutes so nothing is being given away after the hit the cops locate the hit man pretty fast but in trying to arrest him several police officers and civilians are killed he eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy before he escapes back to cambodia this is a movie that never stops and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath yes it is very violent and intense many cops are killed as the hit man proves very very hard to track and take down when they do locate him along the way the hit man in trying to hide in a dump finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man he helps her and saves her from the guy and she persuades the hit man to take her along with him in his escape i loved this movie it's like a roller coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed as one incident leads to another and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit man the acting is exceptionally good and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking there's no let up in this movie not even with the very very incredible ending the ending is pretty much unbelievable and also a fitting end to all the action and violence yes the violence is brutal at times but this is a very no nonsense crime drama that will knock your socks off dog eat dog definitely needs a more widespread release including an r1 release for sure great movie highly recommended,1
this is one really bad movie i've racked my brain and i cannot come up with one positive comment to make the acting is atrocious i've seen more believable performances on cable access the plot is ridiculous stolen diamonds secret recordings of the president and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst night of the sharks isn't even so bad it's good the dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before it's filmed and to top it off night of the sharks has the worst soundtrack i've ever heard i'm surprised my ears didn't start bleeding from the 80s techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to record br br from everything i've read the italian film industry was dead by 1987 night of the sharks is like a final nail in the coffin,0
this show was fabulous it was intricate and well written and all the characters where likable with out being horribly sweet even jonathan cake the philandering boyfriend was likable since our airwaves are filled with crap like american idol and dancing with the stars it was nice to see a drama that was not too soap opera like it was always intriguing to see how each character would be connected to the next circumstance it really is annoying that we finally get a show that makes you think a little bit and have it thrown out because of some mysterious number that most of us don't even pay attention to some of us are not sheep this show will be missed maybe not by a lot of people but by some pretty loyal fans,1
this is a typical low budget 1970's mess it's supposed to be a docudrama about a crew hunting bigfoot through the pacific northwest every character is a stereotype from the native american to the cynical cowboy the acting and narration are a complete joke if you're hoping to see a lot of bigfoot footage keep hoping there won't be much and what there is you could do in your backyard with a cheap costume and a camcorder it would look better than this movie br br it's not that i don't like 1970's low budge fare i do it's that this is such a mess of bad acting bad characters lousy story and no thrills that you just can't enjoy it it does not fit into the so bad it's good category nor can you get a laugh out of how bad it is without the help of illicit substances it's mostly a lot of boring footage of the people camping hiking riding horses and watching wild life there is a bigfoot attack which is completely stupid supposedly our friend sasquatch is throwing rocks down on the campers from above while they fire their rifles back at him by that point you are rooting heavily for bigfoot to drops some rocks on the filmmaker's heads and stop the whole thing,0
there are some things i will never understand why underwear comes in packs of threes when clearly thats not enough is an example similarly i will never understand this film and that is brilliant if you approach this film expecting an actual movie you might as well be approaching satan expecting a hug although that may well be possible if you greet this film's satanic figures take pitch for instance the most ineffectual camp unhellish portrayal of a devil since freddy mercury and wayne sleep joined forces to create a ten foot satan costume from red body paint and horns covered with condoms however it does create some of the most hilarious moments of any film ever seriously this is no understatement the same can be applied to every other character bar the little girl who acts so sickly innocent she's probably overcompensating for some serious crime she's part of then again if santa's inter space recon station is real there is no chance she could have avoided him this long put simply if you haven't seen this movie you cannot consider yourself a serious buff the achingly funny characterisation acting concept and almost under the radar racism makes this a must see above any film to date if you're after pure laughter that is,1
some people might call paulie a kids' movie but i wish to assert that it's more than that probably more than anything else this movie successfully goes to great lengths to show the plight of immigrants in the united states topical given the recent debates portraying a parrot telling a russian immigrant janitor tony shalhoub of how he searched america for his original owners the movie tells several stories there's the elderly woman gena rowlands whom he befriends then a mexican immigrant cheech marin and others br br all in all it's a very well done movie i usually don't expect much from these sorts of movies but this one is a treat i certainly recommend it also starring jay mohr buddy hackett bruce davison hallie eisenberg and trini alvarado,1
bought this movie in the bargain bin at rogers video store for 2 i enjoy a good b movie now and then and figured this looked like a good one br br the movie is quite cliche 1970's and is quite groovy for that unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie in fact i turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and figured a week later that i should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was br br the movie has good spots in it but you have to wait and wait and wait for them br br if you are into b movies this might just be for you just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens and did i mention not much story line either br br,0
two things haunt you throughout l'intrus the intruder who's the intruder and is it a movie or a dream you're watching the ending is so shocking that for a while you're at a loss for an answer to either of those questions the intruder pops up as different characters different men in different circumstances who don't belong in the scene so they're expelled from it kindly or brutally but often without emotional involvement the main character louis is a contemptible man he's got rough ways some mean job and no heart he needs one and goes after it he has a heart transplanted and afterwards decides to start a new life can this man succeed in his quest for redemption a guy like that could cut your throat at the drop of a hat you know it but claire denis doesn't encourage you to judge him occasionally there's a young russian woman a beautiful girl who seems to inhabit someplace between heaven and earth who does judge him she may even punish him but not denis there's the character played by beatrice dalle who wants no business with him don't touch me she says but denis lets this man be himself films him in his self absorbed quest i don't know if what she films is the heart or the mind but it isn't the traditional plot basics whatever she films you get it in the end you know who's the intruder you know why more or less and some scenes come back to your mind with their full meaning but was it a movie or a dream,1
a 14 year old girl develops her first serious crush on the 17 year old boy that lives near by while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister that is the simple premise of this beautiful poetic coming of age film from director robert mulligan mulligan is famous for previously directing summer of '42 in 1971 and to kill a mockingbird in 1962 two giants of the coming of age genre here he directs newcomers in the principal roles reese witherspoon in her film debut as the 14 year old girl emily warfield as the older sister jason london as court the 17 year old boy reese witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut displaying every emotion that a 14 year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt never striking a false note warfield and london are both equally good as well the film accurately depicts each adolescent's thoughts or feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity never crossing over into maudlin excess even once kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from jenny wingfield this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist the music is wonderfully simple accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene but never becoming intrusive the beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director freddie francis who was in his 70's when this was shot tess harper and sam waterston play the girls' parents with dead aim accuracy for 1957 caring strict and emotionally simple gail strickland is good also as the boy's mother there are feelings to sort out lessons to learn and truths to face in this sweet natured film that packs an emotional wallop to date this is robert mulligan's last film this is one of the very best films of 1991 of 4 stars,1
scary yes scary jam packed with nudity from fat people to skinny people maslin beach takes place on a nudist beach in s a br br i first saw this film two years ago it's safe to say it made a bizarre topic of discussion at school the next day this film was horrible hardly a romantic comedy just a showcase of nudity this movie hit its lowpoint with one of the new age characters staring down between a girls legs br br girl you're not going to find god in there guy nah but i think i found heaven br br steer clear of this one unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics such as farting adultery and the process of superlguing one's genitals together avoid,0
fear of a black hat is a hilarious spoof of hip hop culture it is just as funny as this is spinal tap if not funnier the actors are incredible and the documentary style is superb mark christopher lawrence is a tremendous talent that should be starring in a lot more films this film is a true cult classic,1
i saw this film by chance on the small box it has a fantastic and chilling scene about poisonous gas a lot about fanatical patriotism a bit of eroticism i can't believe it's still waiting for 5 votes,1
sondra locke stinks in this film but then she was an awful 'actress' anyway unfortunately she drags everyone else including then real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer it's an exceptionally weak story basically no story or plot at all add in bored poor acting even from the normally good eastwood there's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers wow could a film be any more boring i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun a real stinker don't bother with this one,0
in one of neil simon's best plays creaky cranky ex vaudeville stars played by walter matthau and george burns are teaming up for a tv comedy special the problem is they haven't even seen each other in over a decade full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes this story flies along with a steady stream of humor good work also by richard benjamin as the harried nephew rosetta lenoire as the nurse and howard hesseman as the tv commercial director steve allen and phyllis diller appear as themselves trivia note the opening montage contains footage from hollywood revue of 1929 and shows marie dressler bessie love polly moran cliff edwards charles king gus edwards and the singing brox sisters,1
when thinking of the revelation that the main character in bubble comes to at films end i am reminded of last years machinist with christian bale the only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters br br an understated yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life the title is cause for contemplation perhaps we the audience are the ones in the bubble as we are given no payoffs in the films slim 90 minute running time audience reactions were often smug and judgmental clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves these characters are the ones people refer to as those that put george w back in office for a second term br br it's sobering to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credits role this film has it's merits and is deserving of consideration for the things it doesn't say outright,0
i have two good things to say about this film the scenery is beautiful and peter falk gives a good performance considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction however that said i found this film extremely tiresome watching paint dry would have been more entertaining it seemed much longer than 97 minutes beginning with opening sequence where everyone is talking over each other and paul reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone the movie is annoying the film is filled with clichés and shtick not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by falk also the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears there are some sequences that are touching but they're all played for laughs if schmaltzy sentimental and cute appeal to you you'll love it but if you were hoping for something with more substance see a different movie,0
if i could have rated this movie by 0 i would have i see some ppl at imdb says that this is the funniest movie of the year etc etc excuse me are you ppl snorting lsd or there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie n o t h i n g i actually want my 27 minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap br br i read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes i totally understand that i actually would have watched snakes on a plane for 2 times over instead of watching this movie once br br do not watch this movie do something else useful with your life do the dishes walk the dog hell anything is better than spending time in front of the tv watching hot rod,0
any screen adaptation of a john grisham story deserves a mainstream hollywood approach and robert altman is about the last director i would go to for a mainstream take on anything but this southern fried pot boiler is pretty good while it's not among altman's best it certainly isn't among the films he's made that leave you scratching your head and wondering what he was thinking br br altman had tipped his hat to the mystery thriller with noir overtones before in his 1973 film the long goodbye the gingerbread man is nowhere near as good as that film but it holds up fairly well on its own kenneth branagh is a cocky attorney who finds himself framed for murder after he gets involved with a client embeth davidtz who has enlisted his help in protecting her from her cuckoo father robert duvall the film is set in savannah georgia during the approach of a tropical storm which lends the film an oppressive atmosphere that i very much liked the twists and turns toward the film's end become clunkier and clunkier and altman proves himself to be not all that adept at staging shootouts but overall the film is not a bad addition to altman's canon br br also starring robert downey jr daryl hannah tom berenger and famke janssen br br grade b,1
spoiler i love branagh love helena bonham carter loved them together in mary shelley's frankenstein but this br br i can understand an actor's desire to stretch to avoid the romantic stereotype well they did but really the script droned on bonham carter's clothes were tres chic and the occasional speeded up madcap sequence could have been an outtake from a beatles' movie or the old rowan and martin laugh in br br i never got the point other commenters say the branagh character was a dreamer i never felt that he was a loser and not very bright and certainly not endearing the business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch certainly not amusing br br bonham carter's realistic one supposes attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of lancashire accent in full monty br br the poetic ending with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated was there a choir of angels or merely a soundtrack br br go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it donate this to pbs br br,0
this is quite possibly the worst christmas film ever the plot is virtually non existent the acting affleck in particular is poor at best ben affleck fans will probably defend this film but deep down they must agree as far as i could gather the plot consisted of ben affleck a millionaire salesman is told by a shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood on doing this he ends up paying the family currently living in the house to be his family for christmas and that is it the film goes on and eventually he gets together with the daughter of the family blah blah blah,0
this is a gorgeous movie visually the images of the mexican desert the old mansion the characters in their picturesque costumes all amount to a real work of art br br the story seems a bit loose but that's because it's not meant to be realistic it is taken from a book called one hundred years of solitude and it is supposed to be an evocation of the isolated otherworldly atmosphere of latin america so far from god and so close to the united states the tremendous debt that erendira owes to her grandmother is symbolic of latin america's international debt burden although there many layers of meaning br br if you can appreciate a slow moving richly textured movie this one is for you,1
this movie was terrible throughout the whole movie i was puzzled and did not see any point to it i had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about this movie is not worth watching at all not only is it sick and revolting but totally stupid please don't watch unless you are one of those that likes to watch bad movies if this movie questions japanese society and their values and roles than this is a country that i would not like to visit or bother to know this is a totally sick movie i did not enjoy it because it made no sense my boyfriend and i sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under it was total disappointment,0
dreamquest is by far the best porn movie i've ever viewed this is a must see and if you're skeptical about your little ones watching it just skip over the naughty scenes of course this shortens the movie to a length of about 15 minutes but even then it's enjoyable this movie is quite excellent and beats out almost any movie even shawshank redemption,1
rodney dangerfield is a great he has done a lot of great works but this one is awful the whole plot is whack it could have been much better the jokes in the movie aren't funny their stupid this was very not so hilarious he can do much better than this,0
without reiterating what was said above about this movie i would like to add that i was looking forward to watching this film the cast location and the work of the excellent director michael winterbottom etc it had a vague shadow of 'don't look now' about the storyline from the beginning a stay in different surroundings italy again to dim the heartbreak of loss or perhaps that's how i saw it so consequently i sat there waiting for the story to unfold and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign european country and i sat there and sat there and guess what nothing actually happens and i mean nothing you are not even given the chance to get into the characters as they are so 1 dimensional and vacuous you are led to believe from the pace of the movie that something was going to happen to turn the whole film on it's head the eldest daughters flirtation with the local vespa boys had great scope to take the movie in another direction the youngest daughters visions of her dead mother ended up being a fruitless and pointless exercise the fathers attempts at being seduced by one of his female students felt ridiculous given his age it felt as if the script had a last recall made where they decided at the last minute to eradicated any guts to the story and went for paring it down to a bare minimum to no effect when the credits started to roll unexpectedly you can't help but feel robbed of your time spent sat watching this pile of rubbish,0
i've waited a long time to see dr tarr's torture dungeon and after i watched it i was really disappointed by it it's not the baroque film i expected it to be the trailer which i saw on a something weird dvd is much better than the entire film which is remarkably forgettable there are almost no stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is interesting but it doesn't even come close to other baroque styled movies out there from fellini or jodorowsky the characters are dull and there's almost nothing dramatic going on even though we see rape crucifixion insanity etc br br the main problem with dr tarr's torture dungeon was the fact that it was a talk a thon more than anything else it was almost like watching a book i just wanted the film to have moments of silence or mood or something instead we see listen to the main characters chit chat endlessly about dull stuff br br a missed opportunity,0
so you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film and you might be thinking to yourself huh there were sure a bunch of rave reviews posted on december 30 funny thing is most of these rave reviews sound like they're coming from the same person or at best a small coordinated group of open house groupies the truth my friends is that this film is truly unwatchable just because it's independent doesn't mean it gets a free pass if you're going to make a musical whether on film or on stage whether on broadway or at the local community playhouse you should probably make sure that a your actors can sing b your actors can dance c you have decent sound equipment d you have a well written score and e you have lyrics that are witty and charming even anthony rapp can't save this one it's one of those unfortunate movie going experiences where i actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved,0
i remember watching the bsg pilot i can describe that night exactly i remember what chair i sat in that show was magic it came alive i enjoyed the first two years of bsg i enjoyed parts of the third year even and i watched every episode of the fourth year totally faithfully in great hopes that it would somehow turn around well it didn't br br i watched the caprica pilot and was enthralled there was hope for something good here then i started watching the regular episodes and they are getting more and more boring br br it's too obvious too predictable it reminds me of the droll political correctness of his last failed show virtuality br br much of his line work on ds9 was good when he focused on bsg in an organized way it was good this was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first bsg series when they departed from that after meeting up with admiral cain and the pegasus it all went to pot it was like he wrote the rest of the show without knowing where he was going br br maybe it will improve maybe it was just a few weak initial episodes but i am very very nervous,0
i first encountered this show when i was staying in japan for six months last year i found it in the internet when i was looking for sub titled dramas to help me with my japanese my host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was weird but i found it delightful koyuki showed such conflicting character traits and matsujun's spirit made my day every time i tuned in i first saw him on hana yori dango but i liked him much better in this br br although the characters are interesting and well developed i was disappointed to find that they didn't change very much throughout the show their relationship grew but they didn't really still a fun time had by all even for fukushima,1
i originally watched 8 simple rules on the disney channel uk for the first series and got completely hooked when they didn't show it any more was annoyed but then abc 1 satred showing the 2nd series i didn't think another series would start after i read john ritter had died however the 2nd series wasn't amazing the latest series is back to it's old excellent standard i hope they go on to produce more shows soon even though i could watch each show a thousand times kaley couco is my favourite character as airhead bridget and also performs amazing in charmed rory is also good he shares my name and grampa as well i'll keep on watching it until it ends until then i hope it carries on as funny as ever,1
you're not going to shoot those little creatures in the first place they haven't done you any harm in the second place they may be radioactive ah the joys of no budget 50s sci fi yet despite the odd gem like that superman and the mole men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58 minute running time it's beyond cheap the one shot of superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation and pretty dull with it though it has a surprisingly altruistic message  the mute mole men diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like mr mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious merely misunderstood and george reeves' man of steel tries to prevent the local small town mob led by jeff corey from killing them an interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day perhaps but with little more than good intentions to recommend it,0
many people judge it as a fan service film because a lot of super star starring in this movie gackt hyde and wang lee hom is very famous singer in japan but don't judge it before you watch is what i say gackt and staff are very serious when made this film and they worked so hard it's a good film with a touchy story inside several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad they made it so good until i can't stop watching this all over again br br the story has written pretty well but i admit that their act are little disappointing this is especially for hyde because his skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when he speaks with other language except his native language japan but it's comprehensibility because this is their first time to act in the movie br br i think gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their life when toshi was killed when sho asked kei to turn yi che to being vampire like him because he won't let her die when sho's brother died kei shoot son die and the best and beautiful scene is when sho pass away even i told that hyde's skill is still weird but i give him two thumps up at that scene br br there's a time where the plot goes too fast like they didn't tell the reason why son can join the local mafia and being sho's enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also son is sho's brother in law br br whatever i love this movie very much br br this is an action movie with a touching beautiful story,1
warning tons of dead giveaways don't read if you haven't seen this series or you can whatever br br they're are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and comes out with another liars cheats maybe even some words that can't be uttered but when elm street 6 freddy's dead shows everyone who thought the series got old and wanted to stop seeing him or people who wanted their hero or villian just stops for his final breath this film was it br br this film starts with a parody of wizard of oz then you see a kid who is named only as john doe who is the last child in springwood ohio leaves and gets out of freddy territory a woman who resides at a hospital place to get kids off their feet kind of place meets this boy and at the same time has a dream about a man a water tower and a promise of a secret floating in her mind goes back to springwood to figure out this frightening vision and soon finds out that she is freddy's child and we soon find out that freddy can only leave springwood if his daughter can be a sort of host for him and beyond that fright ensues this film seems to hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know br br this film has tons of humor and cameo appearences like rosanne barr and tom arnold alice cooper johnny depp and a very young breckin meyer playing a teenage stoner who sees psychadelic vision of flowers and iron butterfly's in a gadda da vida then gets stuck in a super mario parody of sorts this film will either make you hate this movie or like krueger even more the best of the best,1
thhe2 is entertaining in that you'll laugh a lot and cringe and probably say oh sh t and get your face away from the goddamn hole you dumb s or things along those lines but i don't know if its really worth seeing i was very annoyed throughout the entirety with the horrible military characters who don't seem to know the first thing about combat br br yes there was more violence gore and a higher body count than the first one but i am still am debating whether that cancels out my feeling throughout the whole movie about how ridiculous it is and not a good ridiculousness like dead alive or feast my time would have been better spent watching aja's remake for the 5th time br br so go for some laughs or go for some gore but don't go hoping to come out of it satisfied,0
laughter is a state of mind says the tag and i hesitate to comment on barry levinson's what could he have been thinking during the making of toys when he watched the rushes did he see a successful funny fantasy if so then he's working on a different plane than i this is an excruciating picture one in which the production design is 90 of the thing and even the cartoon colors are a disappointment robin williams and most especially joan cusack are humiliated as brother and sister of a toy mogul who are bypassed as inheritors of the factory when their dad dies there's nothing remotely funny satirical or slapstick wise on display here it is uniformly draggy ugly and one of the very worst big movies ever made no stars from,0
this wretched movie shows that not even some of gollywood's best can salvage a true landfill deposit br br i could spend much time describing everything that was bad about this effort but that would require more time and i've already wasted 91 minutes watching it br br looking at it now after brando's death shows how tragic the life of one of our greatest actors had become br br donald sutherland why br br i have to fill more lines to get this accepted i have to fill more lines to get this accepted i have to fill more lines to get this accepted br br don't waste your time with this movie i'm overdue to do something interesting bye,0
let me say that i love adam sandler watching reign over me i was paying close attention to his acting br br when he raises his voice i cant help but think of happy gilmore yelling at a golf ball then i snap back as adam sandler sucks me in br br reign over me is a great film a film that comes off slow at first with you expecting emotion in every scene br br don cheadle always does a great job and is no exception here with some truly great lines and is worthy of an oscar in any movie he does br br adam sandler was amazing in so many ways not only was this his most dramatic best acted film of his career but i can recall laughing out loud at many parts of this film br br the supporting cast was great also with saffron burroughs and jada pinkett smith br br i would highly recommend this movie its got tremendous acting beautiful shots of nyc great comedy great drama and a new found respect for adam sandler if you ever doubted him or a reassurance at how great don cheadle is,1
just don't bother i thought i would see a movie with great supspense and action br br but it grows boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start in the middle of the film you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed towards the end the it gets better but not really great i think the director took this movie just too serious in such a kind of a movie even if u don't care about the plot at least you want some nice action i nearly dozed off in the middle main part of it rating 3 10 br br derboiler,0
this last dutch speaking film of verhooven made me laugh good as a film buff looking for all the small details and cross references etc in any movie i can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece amuses all the senses i haven't read gerard reves book on which the film is based but i still believe we get a candid picture of a somewhat self conceited poet writer who gets his in a way no spoiling here an anti hero surrounded by characters that have their ambiguous intentions as has he all this in a superbly packaged cinematography paul verhopven manages to turn the otherwise rather cute gesellich dutch locations into a suspenseful film noir setting impressive work,1
they sell it as a horror movie it's supposed to be a thriller but i found it pretty funny comedy don't think so i laughed the whole movie i think it was because of the ridiculous acting and plot i don't blame the actors i think they were not very good but o k i think cillian is a very good bad guy i loved his acting in batman beggins and rachel mcadams whoa she's a beauty and a good actress as well but let's try to be a little objective here the story mm mm the direction mm mm it lacks a lot of good suspense in fact is a really boring movie but there's one good thing tho it's a short movie only 1 hour and 30 minutes for me it was like 10 minutes under the water br br i just don't know why this movie is rated so high and in rotten tomatoes even higher what's wrong with good rational and objective criticism,0
if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about however there is not much tension and williams' mild mannered portrayal doesn't do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy br br collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear the production felt rushed and holes are apparent it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort the book is probably better br br one thing is certain taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort,1
snow white is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view the plot is pretty much foreseeable the characters are stereotypes the editing too exaggerated anyway the movie seems not to have a lot of artistic ambitions br br instead i think this is a straight commercial thing including a character from the french part of switzerland the actor is the leader of the band he is touring with in the movie the band's called sens unik seems to aim to a larger audience a straight german swiss movie would not have sold in the french part and vice versa what really got on my nerves were the product placements all over the movie sometines scenes remembered of advertisement clips br br i also think the topic of young people taking drugs without any other targets in their lives is a wide spread reality in zurich therefore it should be elaborated with more care i hope samir got enough money with snow white in order that his next movie is gonna show his true artistic skills,0
i´m glad that someone has made a movie about how hard it is to risk your heart for a second time or third this movie is exactly what it promises to be lovely amusing and it gives you this good feeling around your heart when it ends the plot might be not very inventive but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they have not been all used yet the cast is perfectly selected although scott wolf does not look like a father of an eight year old not even when he is wearing a suit so the sparks are on all the right places supporting cast is lovably supporting and although you could probably predict the whole movie you would not want to switch the channel it is just the right sort of entertainment for a sunday evening,1
this is a story about shin ae who moves to milyang from seoul with her young son jun to start over after the accidental death of her husband her husband was born here and she is opening up a piano school but also has ambitions to own some land with the insurance money she received from the death if that is what the film was about it probably would have been like a hollywood film with her falling for some local guy and being happy with her son in their new home but this is not hollywood her son gets kidnapped and murdered ostensibly because it is known she has cash from the settlement the grief process attempts at moving on attempts to clear her conscience of guilt are all done admirably and the lead actress is superb the only caveat and it has to be stated is that this is a depressing film you have to know that going in you want shin ae to go through her grief and find some measure of happiness again this is not hollywood it is korea and in korean cinema especially drama they pull no punches life is what happens to you great acting but sometimes a tough film to watch due to the goings on if you stay you'll be rewarded do that,1
ariauna albright is a really good actress but why she participated in this lame written travesty is a mystery what could have been entertaining winds up as classic boredom the unique thing about ariauna is that she can act as well as look real sexy as opposed to her partner lilith stabs who looks fine but it is obvious she spent the money for acting school at the spa or beautician this was a production that cried out for some t a with a imaginative script writer could have achieved it in the flow of things however ariauna does what she can under the circumstances to a extent salvages her reputation the tempe company should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms the viewers will expect some fetish play t a nough said,0
i wanted to vote zero or lower i loved the commentary it is the worst movie ever made and 'unendurable' is the perfect word for it unless there is something worse that roget never thought of i am also at a loss to think of anything negative enough to accurately describe bo derek the best that could be said of her is she's consistent,0
poor whoopi goldberg imagine her at a friend's dinner party and she adds a comment to the in depth political discussion going on people just look at her and say oh what would you know you were the star of 'theodore rex' how could anyone take her seriously after she lowered herself to be the star of this appalling piece of crap even little kids would be cringing in horror at this thing it reminded me of a particularly bad episode of 'sigmund and the sea monsters' actually come to think of it 'sigmund' was vastly superior to this br br and however did it get made by plying the producer with an illegal substance before telling him about it watch this hideous abomination at your own peril,0
i really cant think of anything good to say about this film not a single thing the script is a nightmare the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and doesnt seem to understand the difference you'd think they would at least get a technical advisor the performances were bad by most of the cast although i dont really blame them the material really stinks the editing was equally bad i'll just stop now its all bad 2 10,0
how many times do we have to see bad horror movies with a killer in a scream ripoff mask the plot of bleed is kinda original but the movie itself is a complete failure for one thing the dialogue is poorly developed it's boring and wastes too much time on trivial details the acting is bad et cetera i want my money back this rental stinks worse than a skunk,0
i saw this not too long ago and i must say this movie is terrible i watch crappy movies for fun scarecreow is not fun scarecrow is stupid you have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful puns as he kills his victims actually worse than the one contained in this sentence he has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings everyone picks on me the only girl that thinks i'm not trailer trash likes one of the guys that pick on me i want to kill everybody wah ok i'm exaggerating but the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movies br br adding to what i just said the kid's mom is promiscuous he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend getting it on mom's boyfriend tells him to leave kid refuses insisting that he isn't going to leave his own house boyfriend chases kid into corn field he kills kid right in front of mom mom screams in terror boyfriend is like omg i didn't mean to then he tells mom not to say anything to the police about it kid was killed under a scarecrow though so like any kid who gets murdered under a scarecrow he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance his victims haven't been stalked like this before scarecrow's official tag line br br to make matters worse this movie was filmed in a whopping 8 days that's right 8 days i was going to give this movie a 2 because in spite of itself it has one or two redeeming moments they're spoilers so i won't spoil it for you if you actually want to see this crap i could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting the horrible special effects the abysmal script and the bad camera work but i simply have no respect for lack of effort on that level br br this movie isn't nearly as good as i'm making it out to be if you want to see an example of how not to make a movie or if you enjoy watching bad movies like i do then watch this at your own risk everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all times,0
even though this movie came out a year before i was born it is definetely one of my favorite comedies it stars redd foxx as a father who tries to understand his son's homosexuality like most parents he doesn't know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like his son norman is now grown up and living on his own when his father ben finds out that his son is gay he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him the title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie when ben gets to norman's apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks it's his son in drag norman is that you the movie had me laughing from start to finish redd foxx is great although a lot of the content is stereotypical i didn't find anything offensive about the way the material was handled and it even has a good ending highly recommended,1
i bought this movie from gamestop's discount used movie bin and the cover caused me to laugh uncontrollably so i bought it for 99cents the movie itself is retarded and they use like ten different monkeys throughout the whole film that hardly look alike not to mention they use a stunt double who is just a short guy in costume making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkey br br the director more than likely committed a murder suicide with the chimpanzees after the movie debuted in a preview for some other low rent warner bros film and he ended up owing money to the studio it also doesn't help that he wasn't even infamous for the terrible job he did he wasn't even known for producing a poop chute film br br why was this movie ever made,0
this film is in no way entertainment but more of a look deep into the depths of the darkest side of human behaviour loosely linking a half a dozen stories of the worst kind of depravities perverted sex greed violence and intolerance all the action is played out over a few very hot and sticky days during a heatwave in vienna and the heat is maybe responsible for some of the anger and hate in the film for me the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment salesman was about the worst episode closely followed by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the 'slags' flat you will be gripped and i hope horrified by this film i hated it but i felt compelled to see it through 1 10 for 'fun' 8 10 for displaying 'man' as he sometimes is,0
why did i enjoy the show to the last episode because of the true talent melissa joan hart and her supporting cast had of demonstrating that whit comedy light hearted humor and deep thought could actually coexist what i enjoyed most was the fact that i could come home from a hard day's work and bust a smile i was inspired and why it was an inspiration to watch as this magical person was so happy while helping others br br sabrina was a hero in my opinion even though she was vulnerable in ways that were not so different from our own to very different she had powers at her fingertip wishes and command that could be used for good or bad which may only exist in many of our imaginations most everything we see have know about own or even desire can be used for good or bad and how we choose to define that defines the person we are br br she traveled the globe and other realms with these constant and unwaivering ideas in mind to learn to live to laugh and to love she was always learning how to improve her skills to the benefit of all around her she made mistakes as she was living life going through different journey's of growth as she her aunts and salem the underrated yet imperfect hero did well to demonstrate that even through mistakes you can still be noble gifted and wonderful br br she also demonstrated many selfless learning and loving acts as she went along her way if this isn't reason enough for 10 stars in this war torn world where people are so hostile toward each other not realizing how differences are the spice of life rather than a reason to kill then i don't know what is this show was most certainly a trip to a better world as well as an inspiration to be better ourselves and a gift intended to bust a smile on our chops i've heard from a doctor before that everything that i've mentioned above leads to a healthy hart and isn't that what we all need,1
here it is the first ever episode of friends where we get introduced to control freak monica gellar courtney cox newly divorced ross gellar david schimmer hippy pheobe buffay lisa kudrow unknown actor and ladies man matt le blanc and very sarcastic chandler bing matthew perry this is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the 6th and final friend spoilt kid rachel green jennifer aniston br br the episode is better than most people give credit for like any new sitcom the first episode isn't always fantastic the acting in this episode isn't great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters apart from kudrow and perry who shine br br matt le blanc man his acting was down right dreadful because until later he gets more confident but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails br br david schimmer why does he over pronounce every word he cannot speak normally but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons but he isn't confident and i cannot sympathise with him jennifer aniston looks hot and does a good job as rachel green but we only see the real rachel later in the 1st season courtney cox looks quite anorexic in this episode its worrying she looks totally different now more healthily she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this 20 minute pilot lisa kudrow and matthew perry i'm doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb and for lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as pheobe pheebs and matthew perry is just matthew perry playing himself basically the episode quality does improve later such as the sets they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly the acting is ok the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot i hope we see the friends reunite cause they will always be there for us,1
the storyline was okay akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie kareena kapoor looked bad there was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner i don't know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role there was nothing much to do for him in the movie just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is said ali khan was alright i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot what are we fools what do they think they will show 2 men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them is the indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals they take an entire squad of 100 policemen and no one was there to surround the palace the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action akshay kumar was between a circle of 30 40 policemen all shooting at him and he shooting back at them none of the policemen's bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen crap crap br br i think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement br br i strongly recommend not to see this movie,0
i would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for jason herb evers constant harping on experiment many early reviewers of the seven samurai accused toshiro mifune of overacting yet as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done jason evers is obviously not toshiro mifune and his overacting is exactly that br br most of the actors in this b classic were rather good actors minus evers and the showgirls if you watch this movie you would have noticed evers shouting almost every line that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose br br the special effects were par for the course in a b movie such as this one in hindsight there isn't much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie,0
rich alcoholic robert stack falls in love with secretary lauren bacall he marries her and is so happy he stops drinking however bacall is secretly loved by stacks' best friend rock hudson and stacks' nymphomaniac sister dorothy malone lusts after rock throw in a few complications and the movie goes spinning out of control in a good way br br very glossy movie in beautiful technicolor with jaw dropping fashions and furnishings check out bacall's hotel room at the beginning everybody looks perfect and dresses in beautiful form fitting clothes basically this is a soap opera with grade a production values the story itself is lots of fun and some of the dialogue at the beginning is hilariously over the top the acting by hudson stack and bacall isn't that good but seeing them so young and glamorous is great especially stack when he smiled my knees went weak dorothy malone on the other hand is fantastic she deservedly won best supporting actress for her role she's sexy violent vicious and sympathetic all convincingly br br fun glossy trash don't miss it,1
i saw this movie years ago on late night television back then it went by the title of stairway to heaven even as a young boy i remember being deeply moved by the story and astounded by the visual effects of the court trial those who have seen it know what i'm talking about such imagination a perfect blend of romance drama humour and fantasy this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made citizen kane casablanca gone with the wind this movie is rated extremely high by imdb voters and rightly so over 51 voters rated it 10 out of 10 over 84 rated it 8 or higher out of 10 i was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until i realized so few have seen rated this movie compared to those on the list what a pity i hope this movie gets released on dvd for region 1 north america so that 1 i can purchase it and 2 others discover this hidden treasure,1
unfortunately this movie is so bad the original out of towners was manic and very funny of course they used the script written by neil simon for some reason neil simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again even the audience i was with never laughed the direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i e the couple having sex in the park they announce it is a lighting ceremony for new york well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging goldie steve do a bit of slap stick the whole movie winds up being like this a joke is set up and given away why isn't goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie you will also notice every close up of goldie they use a very intense soft lens i suggest you rent the original with jack lemmon and sandy dennis that's if you want to laugh,0
let me begin by saying i am a big fantasy fan however this film is not for me many far fetched arguments are trying to support this film's claim that dragons possibly ever existed the film mentions connections in different stories from different countries but fails to investigate them more thoroughly which could have given the film some credibility the film uses nice cgi to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragon's life this is combined with popular tv show csi style flash forwards to make it look like something scientific which it is definitely not in many cases the arguments clues are far fetched in some cases clues used to show dragons possibly existed or flew or spit fire are simply invalid to see this just makes me get cramp in my toes even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it but this one just doesn't have it bottom line it's a pretentious fantasy csi documentary not worth watching,0
this movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery it fails badly at both the only mystery here is why would anybody make such a poorly constructed movie the only comedy is the laugh i got when i saw how high the readers here ranked it could there be two movies with the same name the movie i saw starred a girl with pretty blue eyes and a plot that wasn't there br br,0
this movie offers nothing but the dumbest conversations possible as a matter of fact i most probably could not have imagined how meaningless a film how synthetic the dialogs could be until an hour ago but then again i saw this video in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script one expects to see at least good acting and tasty conversations and even some humor maybe yet this movie lacks them all you heard me it lacks them all there is not a single point i like about this movie none i hate it i'm sure anyone will do so too the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and stuff yet it fails even at the nudity i don't know how but i beared to watch this thing for an hour or so and i definitely recommend you don't do so worst movie i've seen in my entire life if someone offers you to watch it ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife,0
hollywood's attempt to turn jack london's life into a jack london adventure film isn't a bad idea certainly he led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life this film however winds up flat and unsatisfying most importantly it lacks integrity michael o'shea as london has some londonesque speeches and it's nice to see his bearded jack receive the call of the wild after spending some quality time alone in the snowy mountains with his dog buck virginia mayo and susan hayward are both very pretty the film draws unfortunate yellow peril parallels between london's life and world war ii which are both strained and insulting br br jack london 11 24 43 alfred santell michael o'shea susan hayward virginia mayo,0
this is really a very bad movie why first of all the story is bad it is an artificial story combining all sorts of things together that make no sense it just seems a wrong experiment secondly the actors cannot play in a realistic manner they cannot even talk as an actor should why did i buy this movie and what must i do with it now,0
the folks at disney have a lot to explain first and foremost why anyone thought this lesser sitcom material would ever make even a half decent motion picture in the kooky 60's teleplay the unique idea of martians among us had not yet been given the sophisticated x files treatment quaint visions of little green men have long since been dispelled by the likes of e t close encounters and aliens 1 3 br br any charm the property had was mainly due to the endearing relationship created between the late bill bixby as tim and ray walston as the unworldly visitor the conceit that martians have antenna seemed dopey back then now it seems positively idiotic yet christopher lloyd's uncle martin sports the metallic appendages in an early shot the antenna on a sign for the tv station tim works at is supposed to make us think martian when's the last time you saw a tv with rabbit ears eh br br disney doesn't trust quaint or relationships and crams this flick with youth wooing special effects that include a talking space suit named zoot yes you read that correctly uncle martin's silver space suit speaks he is supposed to be a real hilarious cut up figure again i got stretch socks that are funnier than zoot whenever the action lags and it lags constantly computer graphics are put into play to liven things up tim is here played by the amiable jeff daniels who can't or won't do anything to save this floudering mess zesty christine ebersole brings some comic zeal to her neighbor lady role even ray walston himself is dragged painfully into the procedings all to no avail this alien visitor is dead on arrival br br constant talk of sitcoms turning to screen makes me only hope that the i dream of jeannie movie won't feature a talking harem outfit i pray that samantha's cat in the movie bewitched doesn't have lines i live in fear that i love lucy the movie will proudly feature a cg conga drum named bongo br br paging michael eisner mickey mouse take me to your leader,0
how cynical are the writers to pander so i may be an american citizen but i don't need to see other americans pat each other on the back for an hour and half in order to enjoy a film i'm astonished that so few have commented on how utterly jingoistic sentimental and trite the dialogue in this film really is the historical inaccuracies of the film are not as gross and offensive as in u 571 which changes british submariners to american ones but you still walk away feeling a little slimy really the germans in this film do nothing but admire the americans between battle scenes how sad unnecessary i'd just like to say to the writers it's obvious to many of us that you can't capture real people with real problems under real pressure and that you've taken some very well tested shortcuts lucky for you there will always be nationalist nutjobs to appreciate your sugar coated tripe,0
realistic movie sure except for the fact that the characters don't look like to be scared when billy zane tries to kill someone he feels bad but he doesn't look like to that's why i don't like his performance in this movie tom berenger is again playing a soldier no good thrill realistic sequences not always shooting that is one great thing well filmed i hate the helicopter sequence cause only one terrorist kills almost the whole marine bunch i give it and a half out of,0
this is the best movie i've ever seen br br maybe it's because i live just a few miles from the village were the story take place and i know how things work out in this area in sweden the movie tells the truth believe me it both criticizes and honors the lifestyle of dalarna and the producer wants people who watch the movie to be more opened minded and care more for your closest friends and relatives br br but if you live in another small village anywhere in sweden or another country you will probably also recognize much from this movie br br thank you maria blom,1
the wonderful z channel in los angeles showed this pia zadora film about six months or so after butterfly i had such high hopes for the actress and then she goes from bad to obviously worse in this film br br again it was the 80's and i gotta tell you harold robbin's work had been eclipsed by smarter writers jacqueline susann ripped into him she hated his way of writing women irwin shaw's work caught on with many women and of course sidney sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70's early 80's and then came jackie collins who made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books even more so which is why this work smelt harold robbin's work in the 80's just didn't catch on with audiences pia zadora acting in one of robbin's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire the supporting cast was not a help either br br oooooh this was awful to look at then and even 20 more years later it looks even worse i had a hope for pia as an actress and it all got shot to heck when this was done it would be tough for pia to redeem herself as an actress although john waters casting her in hairspray was a spark although she has a nice singing voice br br hey pia wherever you are hairspray may go on tour join the show you may be the biggest comeback story yet br br i just hope they burn this film for ya if you do,0
del you are the dumbest smart person i've ever met br br calvin well i had a brain but they lost it in the re writes br br i think what i find most egregious about this bastardization of asimov's work was how the character of susan calvin was portrayed in the books she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists able to think her way through a problem here she's just a damsel in distress waiting to be rescued by wil smith br br there are passing references to asimov's laws of robotics but they are an afterthought to the cgi and action scenes br br smith is likable as he is in most of his films but honestly the story isn't that good you figure it out long before these genius characters do,0
it's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn off for bored audiences it's the terrible direction with a horrible script and mistakes left and right that makes this too agonizing to watch i'm sorry but i do not see the 'fun' in this just the thrill of pointing the many mistakes and stupid one liners well i'm wondering how dumb the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced probably as dumb as that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound oops did i forget to mention this sheriff's not only a poor actor but also can shrug off an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed flesh i guess he kind of forgot when he won a not so thrilling victory over the snowman,0
clocking in at an interminable three hours and twenty minutes salaam e ishq is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from india that regales us with six interwoven tales of romantic love which is at least four tales too many in my estimation br br filmed like a cross between an mtv music video and a super bowl beer commercial the movie is a sprawling mishmash of exotic settings dazzling colors sexy showgirls high stepping song and dance numbers dream and fantasy sequences winking character asides corny dialogue and way over the top comical performances all pretty much standard issue stuff when it comes to bollywood happenings these days it's an exhausting chore just trying to keep all the characters straight as they dance prance and preen their way through the incomprehensible storyline br br there's plenty for the viewer to feast his eyes on here not least of all all the drop dead gorgeous women but he'll need the patience of job to get him all the way through it,0
very much a film from the times extremely long sequences with no dialogue bad flashbacks and an almost entirely male cast the two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men br br o'toole is riveting whenever he speaks unfortunately he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery alastair sims is always a joy to see but he too is terribly underused br br the film has one additional positive aspect in that it depicts many aspects of british fascism and fascist sympathies such as the casual appearance of the mosley graffiti that many people today are unaware of too many of today's films about wwii paint the allies as all good and the axis as all evil when history tells us people are far more complicated than that br br this would be a good movie for when you're recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex if you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize this is the movie for you,0
i was not expecting much from this movie i was given a ticket for an advanced screening i had just gotten off of work it was hot and i was tired i had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complex br br once seated in the theater tired and frustrated the movie started i did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning but the flow of the movie was perfect right from the beginning i became consumed with the movie getting more and more excited with each minute passing i think this movie is destined to be a fantasy fairytale classic the actors were fabulous the pace was perfect and the ending was magical,1
first of all the only reason people keep bitching about this film is because they can't stand a few parts of the true story being altered well guess what peter jackson's film wasn't a perfect rendition either well enough ranting this is a very beautiful film the backgrounds are gorgeous and taken from well known tolkein artists the film covers about half the trilogy fellowship of the ring and up to the battle of helms deep in the two towers and moves at a good pace the voice casting is top notch and the most of the characters look like i imagined they would samwise is a bit too ugly for my tastes but aragorn looks awesome the film has a great score that completely supports the movie if you enjoy good fantasy stories but hate reading the books are even better give this movie a try keeping in mind it was made 20 odd years ago br br also of particular note peter jackson's adaption of fellowship follows almost exactly the same strand as ralph bakshi's jackson has said many times how much he admired bakshi's effort,1
this movie i've loved since i was young its excellent although it may be a bit much for the average movie watcher if one can't interpret certain subtleties in the film for example our hero's name is achilles and in the final battle between him and alexander he's shot in the heel with a rocket just as achilles in mythology was shot in his heel that's a just a little fact that is kind of amusing anyway great movie good story it'd be neat to see it redone with today's special effects oddly enough gary graham had average success starring in the t v show alien nation this movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated,1
i've found the movie offensive for americans which lost somebody in the towers for american people in general pretending to be an homage to horrible facts happened last years each director takes the opportunity to polemize with old facts which have none to do with a terrorist attack or criticize american's political behaviour or compare different political situation as they have in own country having this nothing to do or to share with the atrocity of september 11 shame on them,0
this is truly an excellent film with a revolutionary message both in form and content that should not be missed by any fan of french new wave or underground film there are barely opening or closing credits we are just dropped into the world of consumerist art revolution and youth this film has little to do with documentary and is more interesting in playing with our ideas of advertising and its relationship to reality lines of real and not real are crossed in ways familiar with films discussing documentary but this time we do it for the sake of consuming and marketing not for describing the real,1
the seventh sign borrows a lot from rosemary's baby and the omen it actually blends the two stories even its title recalls bergman' s the seventh seal br br nevertheless it begins well enough with all the omens scattered on the whole earth and in parallel a seemingly distinct plot with moore's husband trying to save a poor boy who killed his parents who were brother and sister from death penalty this time both christian and jewish religions are called to the rescue even the wandering jew is involved which makes the lines sometimes unintentionally funny have you ever been to sunday school but they taught me that god was love the best scene imho is the short dialog between priest john heard who does not seem to take things seriously too bad he was not given a more important part because his laid back acting is priceless and the young jew br br demi moore probably registered the same desire as ex husband bruce willis saving the world she does not save the movie for all that,0
and this movie has crossed it i have never seen such a terrible movie in my life i mean a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled a snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible this was a pitiful excuse for a movie,0
jennifer jason leigh and mare winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings but only winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role leigh playing bar band singer and alcoholic sadie flood constantly leans on older sis georgia an acclaimed folk singer in the joni mitchell mold perhaps due to her double duties as co producer on the film leigh seems to have boxed herself into a corner she isn't credible as a singer and even if this is intentional gives herself far too much screen time at the microphone probably hoping for a tour de force leigh is wire drawn and nervous and jagged however we simply do not see any talent within this character leigh is obviously a solid actress but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her if sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the small breaks that she does as it is the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim director ulu grosbard crafts a few intense dramatic sequences and the editing at the finale juxtaposes sadie's bar performance with georgia's sold out arena show both singing the same song and it's a sadly nuanced moment but really what's the point 1 2 from,0
this cordial comedy confronts a few bizarre characters especially of course the two leading characters jack lemmon plays felix a hypochondriac whose wife lost him because she couldn't stand his cleaning and cooking attacks any longer so he tries to kill himself but every attempt fails walter matthau plays oscar his friend an untidy unreliable sports reporter who lives in divorce from his ex wife in a bachelor apartment he offers his distressed friend felix a new home in his apartment and soon the trouble begins because two such contrary characters can't live together for a long time felix turns oscar's disorderly flat into a clean exhibition flat he cleans and cooks the whole time after a short while oscar feels persecution mania filmed in a theatrical way and excellent acted above all jack lemmon's play is wonderful he is the perfect clown he makes us laugh but in a tragi comic way look for the wonderful scene when both men invite their two female neighbours for supper because oscar has to touch something more softer than a bowling ball while he is preparing the drinks felix sits with the two young ladies in the living room to get out of this embarrassing situation he starts to talk about the weather a minute later he changes the subject and talks about his ex wife and children suddenly he begins to weep and when oscar comes back with the drinks there are three weeping people in the living room the film is full of such amusing and at the same time touching scenes an intelligent entertaining comedy with much heart 10 out of 10,1
this film is quite simply brilliant the cinematography is good the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking this is the story of donald woods a white south african who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid kevin kline is completely convincing so much so that when donald woods himself appeared on tv some years later i recognised him from kline's portrayal denzel washington also turns in a masterful performance as ever br br i urge you to watch this it is long but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story remember folks this really happened,1
you know our spirit is based on that revolution it's asleep i can explain i think well until that happen on 25th april 1974 our freedom was limited we didn't had liberty of speech but when we got it at the revolution it seems that portuguese people lost his opinion we don't use our liberty of speech that's all a consequence of the revolution i think that's clear about the movie i think that it has a few mistakes on some character's acting but by the way i use to watch on portuguese movies it's quite good i like it very much,1
the first one was different and funny this attempt should have never left the studio this movie does not make you laugh it is a weak attempt at gross out humor the movie picks out current and old movies to rip off this time the jokes seem used and overdone the audience that i saw it with only re acted to hannibal dinner scene and was otherwise asleep,0
this movie has made me upset when i think of cat in the hat im thinking of cat in the hat books you know the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children well i though that this movie would be a lot like that but much to my suprise was nothing like the books insted it is more like young adult humor movie in one part cat is talking to a gardening tool hoe cat talks to it like it is his hoe agin adult humor the naming of his car i all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie under the rating you'll find mild cude humor and some double entendres i think in short this means adult humor i wish i could return this movie wal mart said they wouldn't because the movie has been opened if you are thinking about buying this i suggest that maybe rent before you buy,0
poor ivy though to the manner born she had the bad luck to marry a charming wastrel richard ney as the movie is set in the 20s or 30s when rigid victorian ideas of class were starting to fray at the edges this uncertain status vexes her unduly the gretorexes for so they are called don't know where their next shilling is coming from but there are yachting parties and fancy dress balls in posh pleasaunces aplenty to tempt her when ivy joan fontaine makes the acquaintance of a wealthy older gent herbert marshall who must have been born middle aged she sets one of her extravant chapeaux for him luckily one of the beaux she still strings along patric knowles is a physician whose consulting rooms provide a cache of poison with which she bids her hubby farewell the fact that it implicates knowles doesn't phase her a bit even as the hours trickle by until he should be hanged by the neck until dead the turning of the plot depends on police inspector sir cedric hardwicke knowles' mother the redoubtable lucile watson and knowles' loyal housekeeper una o'connor sam wood adds some subtle touches to this well above average melodrama fontaine's luminous face supplies the rest,1
alright i have to admit that i have never seen rhoda and only one or two episodes of the mary tyler moore show even though i don't know anything about this duo of comedic talent i still liked this movie a lot br br mary goes back to work rose tries her luck at being a comedian rhoda struggles with a photography career and meredith what exactly does she do again these three stories that we follow over two hours are amusing and entertaining in their own way when the two long time friends reunite it only makes the film better br br i was surprised about how good the writing was the little jokes thrown in by mary and rhoda were funny the script itself was very well put together br br i had seen moore and harper in other movies over the past few years and thought that they were very good but i had no idea that they worked this well as a team while both actresses do their share to fulfill the title of this movie they never seem to let me down during the run of this movie joie lenz and marisa ryan play their roles okay but nothing great the rest of the cast like jonah cecile and everybody else also works well together br br being that this is a reunion you would expect for a fan of either show to enjoy this from a non fan i still enjoyed this little get together good story lines for each character and the two main characters is what makes this film very good the newer version of the mtm theme song doesn't hurt either,1
with 'twelve monkeys' you need to pay attention but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate i know i did the story is interesting and deals with time traveling a virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named cole bruce willis is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus in 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital there he meets jeffrey goines brad pitt who probably has something to do with the virus he also meets psychiatrist dr kathryn railly madeleine stowe who doesn't believe him in 1990 when cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re appears in 1996 kathryn starts believing cole's stories br br the movie constantly plays with time cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996 it is picked up in the future and they send someone for cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention you could ask some questions but since you can't have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie br br 'twelve monkeys' works as sci fi with some great images and a dark atmosphere and it works as a thriller you are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie may be it has some flaws in the story but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy that was the easy part for me,1
we so often talk of cinema landmarks kane the godfather a bout de souffle one film however is too often overlooked by serious film critics i am talking of course about the classic doc savage m o b br br this film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by us imperialism not to mention kung fu br br it also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history until of course queen's breathtaking work on flash gordon although a bit of a rarity this film is well worth seeking out it will repay the effort of your search ten fold,1
the prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of nietzche's work and personality psychoanalytical techniques and vienna's history take a well know genius you have not read describe him as demented include crazy physicians to cure him a couple of somewhat good looking women have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache have every character speak with the strongest accent show ridiculous dreams include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one freud mention a few words used in the genius' works overdo everything you can particularly music and you are done audience please stay away,0
don't get me wrong i love david suchet as poirot i love the series as well as the movies but enough already re death on the nile everyone has done this one we know who dies we know why they die we know who the killer is we know how it was done so i say enough already mr suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha christie's novels i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb the sets were terrific and very realistic i especially liked david soul but i was surprised at how 'awful' he looked i hope he doesn't look that way in 'real' life i honestly can't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same somehow i don't think so i thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not ms christie wrote it that way i would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison,0

i admit that i am a vampire addict i have seen so many vampire movies i have lost count and this one is definitely in the top ten i was very impressed by the original john carpenter's vampires and when i descovered there was a sequel i went straight out and bought it this movie does not obey quite the same rules as the first and it is not quite so dark but it is close enough and i felt that it built nicely on the original br br jon bon jovi was very good as derek bliss his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives one of my favourite parts was just after he meets zoey and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems his comments are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds br br the other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film it is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way fright night ii grew out of fright night there are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme br br if you like vampire movies i would recommend this one if you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else,1
i have seen the trailer for this movie several times over and i have to say that ned kelly looks like it is going to be a wonderful film when i saw the trailer for the first time i could not take my eyes away from it it got my attention for sure heath ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him period pieces not to mention orlando bloom who is seen for a split second looks fantastic i think that this movie will be a hit and will be seen over and over again my many people,1
dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and murder and mayhem result violent sexy milligan at his most home made little better than a home movie as much of milligans films are this is a trip into depravity 1960's style notable for the copious nudity and sex this film is neither sexy nor gruesome playing now more as quaint though decidedly r rated the film suffers from its uneven cast and from the cheapness of the production no one was ever sure where the money went on his movies since he was always broke its a bad bad movie thats not worth seeing except as a milligan completeist or because its got some good looking people fooling around,0

this comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail there have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which haven't come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one this is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by reg rogers and ally sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film at first the action seems rather off the wall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves even if grudgingly through each other rogers' heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and sheedy's angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them you will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it's in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread hopefully audiences will get to see more of reg rogers and ally sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt,1
an avent garde nightmarish extremely low budget film that has delusions of grandeur hard to sit through i get the message that child abuse is wrong wow big revelation i had no clue it was wrong before viewing this yes that's sarcasm don't watch this film if you're offended by nudity of either the male or female gender don't watch it if you're the least bit squeamish don't watch it if you care about acting on second thought just don't watch it period br br my grade d br br dvd extras making the movie the premiere interview with kristie bowersock deleted scenes movie stills director's commentary 2 versions of the teaser trailer music video by the azoic a classroom video experiment,0
a cast of 1980's tv movie and tv series guest stars misty rowe pamela hemsley clevon little seymour cassel among several others in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of complications br br over done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an r rating but not enough good material to engender any real interest this is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel cinemax the alternate name of skinamax i really can't see the point of watching this unless you need to see every sleazy thriller out there i also have to comment that this film is filled with smoking to the point that it becomes laughable when anyone lights up,0
when i saw this movie first it was long ago on vhs video i did like this movie because it was funny and excitingly some years ago i saw another movie called andy colby's incredible adventure in this movie were parts of wizards of the lost kingdom used in they called this movie kor the conquerer i began to search for the kor movie many years because i wanted to see the complete movie not only the parts which were used in the andy colby movie no shop had this kor movie to rent and no shop did know this movie many years i watched my old vhs tapes i had at home and what a wonder i had this movie since many years still at home but the movie had a different title because in germany it has 3 or 4 titles so i was happy to find this tape at home and this time i had much more time in watching kor the conquerer again the music is great during the hole movie but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment when kor is walking drunken through the green forrest the music in the background had some kind of magic i like bo svenson and also the boy who played simon in the movie both of them did their job very good manfred kraatz germany 26 10 2004 thanks to all for reading my comment,1
to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesn't mean it is a terrorist thing it also show's how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it doesn't mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane and how he used words like blow up or yaser saying we'll blow away the competition and people took it the wrong way being a muslim i know that stuff like this don't usually happen but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq its not right things are not like that people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act i am glad a show like this came on the air there are many shows that piotr muslim people as terrorists many people do find them funny to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair but it is done to often and really gives muslin people a bad name,0
i first saw this film when it was transmitted around 1988 by the bbc when i was working on uk's 2000ad my pal steve parkhouse recorded it on vhs and sent it to me up till this point i'd really only seen the shaw bros kung fu movies with their harsh lighting so audience could see the moves clearly so it was a revelation to me to see something that looked like it had been lit by ridley scott coming out of hong kong this was also my first exposure to the movies of tsui hark pronounced apparently choy huk br br yet for all the smoky back lit exteriors and ambitious special effects stop motion in a hong kong movie at the heart of chinese ghost story lies a simple and moving love story made all the more real by the outstanding acting talent of leslie cheung what a tragic tragic waste of a life and the beauty and elegance of joey wong granted joey is gorgeous but it's her balletic hand gestures that give her character an unattainable eroticism that's hard to analyse and though joey is now almost 20 years older gawd which of us isn't this will always be the enduring image of that actress br br some reviewers here have said that the film is simplistic and lacks any surprises but they're missing the fact that this movie was based on a famous chinese story written by pu songling around 1700 that's a bit like complaining that romeo and juliet has a predictable ending and just copies west side story just wanted to get that off my chest br br for me chinese ghost story is the quintessential romantic tale it has high tragedy because we know that chio sin and sin seen can never be together it's about becoming mature for none of us can mature until we've experienced great loss it's about sacrifice for sacrifice is an essential component of true love and the comedy stylings of wu ma don't hurt a bit either br br enjoy chinese ghost story by trying not to view it through a filter of western culture and you'll get on with it just fine,1
hm while an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes point out atrocious acting primitive at best special effects all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years severed ranks among the worst i've ever seen i'm never sure who the protagonists are all i know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine as seen in the dance floor murder scene all in all i don't really like the movie because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion which i can't remember anyway,0
interesting how much more realistic brosnan's performance is to that of the original james bond novels when compared to the bond films he's neurotic paranoid an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot this is perfect break for him even so much as to make fun of the bond icon i'm a mess a parody of myself he says it doesn't get any better than that i just finished reading dr no and this is very much how ian fleming had portrayed james bond personally i never liked brosnan as bond because he fit the icon too closely there was nothing for him to personalize the character with as compared to roger moore or sean connery its great to see brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall a shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with it's an impressive portrayal and having greg kinear to ground him is just poetic this movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in my blue heaven but more genuine in their coping mechanisms,1
if you still remember that summer when you had your first kiss first boy girlfriend or first puppy love fling this film is for you ok so this movie would and will never win an oscar but as a dominican i loved it there are some things in the movie that might just go right over your head if you are not part of the culture the kids being raised by a grandma who's both mother and father the youngest son being babied and bathed with a cafe bustelo tin sooo dominican judy being harassed by the neighborhood men going to church and lighting a prayer candle the film's brilliance was in those small details granted it was not a pull out all the works cinematic extravaganza but it wasn't meant to be nor was it meant to be an educational tool for those wanting to learn about latin culture tip make new friends instead more of a bitter sweet faux cumentery this film kept it real without taking itself too seriously as in the tradition of y tu mama tambien this was simply one boy's coming of age tale i recommend it especialmente si eres dominicano o,1
a female executioner played by the sexy jennifer thomas ii has the fun job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all the men on death row before they meet their maker and what a way to go lucky this film is not real or we would have a lot more people in this world on death row br br it starts out real slow low light and bad acting like most b films it gets better as it moves along and ends with a bang br br i would rate it very high on the low cost very sexy movies of the 90's it's a must see once the kids are away or in bed,1
i was skimming over the list of films of richard burton when i came to this title that i recall vividly from when i first saw it on cable in 1982 i remember dialogue from tatum o'neal that was just amazingly bad i remember richard burton's character looking so hopelessly lost and then remembering how his motivations didn't translate to me in short i remember circle of two because it was so phenomenally awful br br this movie came out at a time when america was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality recall the blue lagoon and other brooke shields annoyances lipstick little darlings beau pere and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex particularly with adults as a teenager during this time i found the obsession combined with the sexual excesses of the 70's and 80's made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out so to speak br br circle of two is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient like blue lagoon in fact it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave if totally failed way but honestly it is one of those films you will never see if you didn't see it on its first run because it was so truly awful no one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again,0
there are laughs in this film that is for sure michael keaton is a talent and he used to be funny before he decided he was a serious actor however what bothers me so much about this film is how unlikable practically all of the characters are other than the main two leads everybody is a jerk i mean these small town losers are about as uncouth as you can get you just watch and think man these losers should be unemployed moreover the american factory worker is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slob it made me wonder if this film was made by japanese nationalists oh sure in the end they all come together as one but i just did not enjoy the trip to get there,0
the lack of content in this movie amazed me the most first i though that people was going to compare this to rock on but i'm really surprised myself to say that this was worst than rock on so so story horrible cast ajay devgan jamming with salman khan and asin you gotta be kidding me the music was okay khanabadosh was the track of the movie the rest was bad vipul shah hasn't still learn from singh is king's critically bashed comedy now asin where do she come from sorry for asin's fan out there but she suck d big time in this movie seriously bad acting she didn't look good at all overdose of make up my final verdict go watch aladin with your family instead wasting your time here,0
all you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene where a guy falls into a lake and gets eaten then they start rolling the title credits you see slugs in big letters followed shortly thereafter by the movie whew i was worried i had accidentally tuned into slugs the musical or slugs the game show anyway from there the movie deteriorates into a kill fest you see a guy cut his hand off because he had slugs in his gardening glove two people get attacked by slugs while having sex and a girl falling on her back in an underground passageway get stung to death by killer slugs it's a pretty silly movie falling in the so bad it's good category it also is shot so poorly with such grainy film that you're shocked to learn it was made in 1988 my guess was 1974 i'm very surprised it has received as high a score as it has here because most people here don't give those types of movie any love but if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being laughable this is one of your prime candidates,0
i feel like i have some uber rare disease that no one has heard of and i have finally come across a support group on the net i finally found this title by asking for an answer on an experts site on the web i too saw this movie in my youth and was struck by the atmosphere and especially the ending i have never forgotten it and have never seen it since no one i know saw the film and i had almost given up on ever finding it's title alas even knowing the name i shall probably never see the film again as it is impossible to find commercially small steps br br g,1
what could have been an engaging and emotionally charged character study is totally undermined by the predictable factor fox is ok as nathaniel ayers the julliard trained musician who dreams of playing with the walt disney orchestra until his bouts with schizophrenia drive him into the street and ultimately skid row looking for a good story to boost his flagging career reporter steve lopez robert rehab downey gets to know him and tells his story taking every element of the classic how we hit the skids movies borrowing very liberally from a beautiful mind taking the bogus feel good attitude of films like rocky you pick the sequel number and whipping up too much 1930s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie it is corny trite utterly predictable and plays way too often on our sentiments i hate to say it but this is the kind of movie that if you say you hated it people will give you bad looks i really wish i could say something positive about this film but i really can't the acting redeems it somewhat but not enough for me to give it more than one star strictly made for tv movie stuff not worth your time,0
scanners ii the new order is just as good as david cronenberg's classic scanners scanners was made in 1980 and scanners ii in 1991 so their's an eleven year gap between the two movies the film captures the style of scanners which is a good thing it wouldn't be scanners without a head explosion so scanners ii has a head explosion scene that's just has gruesome as the first scanners ii the new order has some other imaginative gory scenes that are done well the plot to scanners ii the new order is a new take on the series since it has the scanners being used as a vigilante force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young scanner named david kellum discovers he's being used and decides to get revenge br br scanners ii the new order is a great sequel to david cronenberg's sci fi classic scanners and should be seen check this out 10 10,1
i thought it was not the best re cap episode i've every seen though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the brendan fraser moment sigh it was nice to see cox outside of the incessantly brittle coxism state he is in these days if only for brief moments i also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character's hair or height in case of jd and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes i can also see how zach might be well on the way to a very chevy chase or is that matthew perry prat fall induced chemical slide already acknowledged on conan a little side note the song now stuck in my head from the janitor induced dance montage was diner by martin sexton,0
the first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her she is beaten savagely spun around in the chair endlessly has her finger nails pulled animal guts are thrown at her hot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle really sick and nasty scene the makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape of course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome i have seen also flowers of flesh and blood which is more gory and sadistic but less disturbing anyway this one is a must see for horror fans,1
i wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry porretta was good looking but resembled like a mexican porn star not an english outlaw costumes what costumes a t shirt with strips of black leather on it it was marion's clothes or lack of them that really got me do the 'fans' of this stinker really believe women dressed like that in medieval england the mongols and vikings were inaccurate and stupid but the episode with an alien was worst of all especially as his make up mainly consisted of oatmeal on his face an old trick the hedgehog monster was pretty funny as was climbing up the side of a castle on a ladder of arrows as if the us accents grated as did the initial drawling voice over' raw bin hood and liddle john' the second robin and marion were really quite minging in looks and what was left of the show went totally down the pan,0
this film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in california she thought it was wonderful because it was so real just the way people in the ohio valley are i'm from the area and i experienced the film as just the way people in california think we are i've lived in marietta and parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there we laughed a lot we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age the young people went out together at night the older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families the area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else br br aside from the if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed condescension the story lacked any elements of charm mystery or even a sense of dread br br martha's character was the worst drawn it's doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church but if she had she probably would have made friends there i've read reviews that seem to assume martha was jealous of rose because rose was younger prettier and thinner but if this is the case it isn't shown all we actually see is martha learning to dislike rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender we see martha feeling left out during smoking sessions left out of the loop when social plans are made used but not appreciated and finally disrespected and hurt br br just one more thing are we supposed to suspect kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks please this takes stigma against mental illness to a new level,0

until i saw this special on hbo i had never heard of eddie izzard i sure am glad that i have now he is one of the funniest comedians i have ever seen rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then eddie i could not stop laughing for the entire show if you like to laugh you have to see this special,1
well i like to be honest with all the audiences that i bought it because of kira's sex scenes but unfortunately i did not see much of them all sex scenes were short and done in haphazard manner along with all the weird and corny background music just like all other b movies it just doesn't look much like two people having sex there is a tiny bit of plot toward the end kira's new lover is a killer whoa how shocking why don't we nominate this movie for oscar award i can't imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were r rated mine is imported from uk rated 18 conclusion put it down and walk away so yon won't end up with being a moron like me br br score 2 10,0
this is the one in which the diminutive ruth gordon plays an agatha christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of suffocation while gordon is traveling back and forth to new york he manages however to leave behind some clues scratches on a couple of black safe deposit boxes and an improvised and well hidden note columbo enters the case suspects her at once and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers oh and mariette hartley is on hand as gordon's secretary and would be blackmailer hartley is i believe the grand daughter of the psychologist b f skinner i'm not sure her ancestry had anything to do with her attractive belly button which is on display during a belly dance sequence but i've always admired skinner anyway br br the murder is well handled it's a good plot and none of the performers or crew fluff anything but the outstanding figure here is ruth gordon only a skosh over five feet tall she was over 80 years old and looked it there are moments when she almost teeters but she consistently exudes charm her acting is idiosyncratic you can never be sure when she's being serious or when she's putting columbo and the audience on she's given some good lines too what humor there is comes from gordon columbo doesn't have any of his frequent comic moments br br all in all a nice job by everyone concerned,1
my how the mighty have fallen kim basinger is a great actress but she was definitely slumming when she took this role this movie is bad for one reason in particular lapses in logic its looks like one of those movies that would have been passable with all its plot holes if it had came out in the 80s and 90s but in 2008 it just looks real stupid this is the worst thriller i've ever seen and i've seen the bone collector and twisted br br the story details della kim basinger is just getting from buying gifts in a mall an is harassed by a gang of thugs that end up killing a cop that came to her aid from then on she is chased by these idiotic goons through an abandoned street and she gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of tools br br so many things are wrong with this movie as i said this movie leaps over logic at every turn and with the exception of kim basinger the acting is made for tv bad hell this pseudo thriller is made for tv bad the way she kills each of these politically correct thugs 1 caucasian 1 hispanic 1 asian and 1 african american all coming together to stalk a caucasian woman don't you just love america is laughable to a fault the way she killed the hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically the sex scene with the main hoodlum was so out in left field that it make you shake your head in shame i only recommend this to lovers of bad films and no one else anybody else especially kim basinger fans would do well not to own this flick you don't want see an actress you respect in a film this bad now do you of course not you were warned,0
this movie is the first time movie experience for several people in the cast all of them are experienced actors and have played in several tv series and plays sahan gokbakar is a well known comedian in turkey it's kind of strange to see him in a thriller while he is at the peak of his comedy career in turkey this movie is togan gokbakar's first long shot and pretty much the first experience as a director but they all did a good job we are happy to see such enthusiastic young cast they seem very promising for the future of the turkish film industry doga rutkay being long time sweetheart of sahan gokbakar is also a talented actress who is known for her recent play in number 27 theatrical play and several tv series,1
trash bad movies usually ain't bad because i will find them enjoyable this one is so bad that i am out of words to describe it its below bad there is an instruction in the beginning of the film that tell you what to do during the movie needless to say the instruction and a dozen of beer couldn't help me seat through the entire film one tagliner compares this one to killbill which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent obviously this tagliner had a plan to tempt you into buying this dvd br br if you are considering renting this one put it down if you are thinking of buying dont think if you unlucky to have this dvd dont play it throw it in trash bin immediately,0
the movie never claims to be something spectacular like many films do the films props itself as a fun and entertaining time and that's exactly what it was it is the korean version of a male bring it on br br from the get go you can feel for the rest of the film and how it will end but the enjoyment is not in the surprise twists nor is it the way the film is a carbon copy of another instead the enjoyment is held in the journey of how the 2 remaining thugs came to be men in their own right therefore the film is fun and entertaining br br the camera work specially the dolly moves were very well executed the script being a tad weak was overly enjoyable in the fact that the characters were not 2 dimensional but they were full of life and desire this film will not win any oscars nor any dvd blockbuster sales but a fun watch and a fun experience,1
it's easy to forget once later series had developed the alien conspiracy plot arc more that once upon a time the x files' wrote episodes like genderbender and fearful symmetry where the aliens weren't all little grey men or mind control goop but could actually surprise you br br fearful symmetry starts with an invisible elephant actually an elephant somehow dislocated in space and time not a mile away from the walk and ends with a pregnant gorilla being abducted and it's very much an episode of wonderful moments the subplot is annoyingly worthy yeah we get it zoos are bad except when they're not but the ideas that within it are fascinating visually powerful and very memorable and it covers an angle on abduction that is largely overlooked why would humans be the only things that aliens are interested in br br in the end it wasn't an instant classic but it was enjoyable viewing while it lasted again very memorable and mainly it's something that you couldn't imagine many other shows doing,1
an underrated addition to the graham greene cinematic canon its perceived faults can now be seen as virtues director shumlin theatrical director frames his action with an oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material and the seemingly inept compositions compellingly suggest unease both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration for the female character in a 40s thriller the film has an upright hero who turns mad and murderous and possibly paedophiliac brilliantly brings the faraway ideologies of the spanish civil war into jolting dangerous reality has one horrific murder an astonishing insights into class and capitalism clever theatrical metaphors a rare approximation of greene's god and an ending that is only happy if you know nothing about history,1
the next time you are at a party and someone asks the other day i heard the expression 'author's will' does anyone know what it means tell them to sit through 'head above water' the only way diaz could possibly have survived this movie was by means of this literary device commonly used by bad writers there are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs however the film does not stand up to the most minor logical analysis why does keitel tie diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course for me the best part of this movie was that i saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop,0
i have things to come on d v d and it's very clear compared to my vhs version the audio is fair but can be hard to understand at times br br i liked the movie so much that i searched for a copy of the book and found it it gave details of why some things happened the best things about the movie are the small things that i didn't notice at first such as john cabal playing with a toy airplane at a christmass party like it was a dive bomber out dateing sea power by naming a battleship dinosuar ships sunk by air power an undeclared enemy sneak attack by airplanes swept flying wing planes strong rolls for the women through the entire movie br br there are more see the movie to enjoy them,1
come on they did that on purpose two of my current faves on tv meloni from oz and l and o svu and janel from west wing hook up for a nice little sleeper character study plot's nothing fancy but the acting is right on the mark tim busfield shows up for some neat bits worth a look,1
frank tashlin's 'the home front' is one of the more lifeless private snafu shorts a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military rather than have snafu take some inadvisable actions leading to disaster 'the home front' instead focuses on his loved ones back home and how much they have to offer to the war effort too snafu realises he was wrong when he thought they had it easy it's a concept with few possibilities for good gags and instead tashlin plays the risqué card more heavily extended jokes involving strippers and scantily clad dancing girls in place of much effective comic relief the result is a well meaning short which has little relevance or entertainment value today other than as an historical artefact,0
a good cast is appallingly wasted in this slower than molasses and haphazardly connived comedy peter ustinov tries hard here to bring something to life but the result is a dour bore that misses all the right beats that might have made it watchable regardless of the favorable comments here this film is awful badly directed badly edited badly acted badly written you need to sit through a hundred movies to come across one this bad br br the muddled and excruciatingly laggard plot concerns ustinov conning his way into an american insurance company in order to hack their computer and embezzle millions of pounds how he does it is beyond lameness and credibility he just learns his computer skills seemingly overnight by reading some pamphlets and hoodwinks computer expert robert morley into going to south america and stealing his identity br br as a side plot ustinov romances fellow loner maggie smith who just happens to become his secretary by chance after he gets a flat in her building she ends up sharing scenes that have sexual undertones with bob newhart that go nowhere while ustinov goes about grafting the money bit by bit and trying to keep one step ahead of newhart and karl malden then he marries smith and they fly off to brazil which has become the staple finale of almost every british caper comedy since nuns on the run a fish called wanda br br the surprise twist of an ending is more laughable than everything that came before by the end i was thinking i must be truly off my rocker to stick out drivel like this even a cameo by cesar romero didn't help it one of the most unfunny poorly paced 'comedies' i've ever seen and certainly the worst caper don't waste your time if you love this you need to see better films,0
don't drink the water is an unbelievably bad film it's based on a 1966 broadway play by woody allen it stars jackie gleason the comic genius behind the honeymooners the director howard morris has appeared in several mel brooks comedies life stinks high anxiety silent movie and has made a mark in animation characters he has voiced include gopher from pooh jughead archie and beetle bailey what went wrong br br i think the problem is that the premise is played out too seriously to work effectively allen's original play was tongue in cheek which is why it worked on broadway and in allen's 1994 remake the screenplay by r s allen and harvey bullock beats the premise to death and makes too many changes from the original play making gleason's wife an airhead in this version when she was a headstrong woman in the original is just one example of why this doesn't work br br the acting isn't much better gleason does the best he can with the material but he can't save this gleason was a comic genius but also a fine actor as he demonstrated in the hustler and soldier in the rain his abrasive personality could have worked here but the lousy script doesn't even give him a chance too bad estelle parsons' airhead wife will drive you nuts after 20 minutes see how soon it'll take for you to want to strangle her that is also a shame because she is also a fine actress having turned in two exceptional performances in bonnie and clyde and rachel rachel none of the other actors do particularly well either br br woody allen hated this film so much that he remade the film in 1994 with himself and julie kavner marge simpson in the leads they manage to hit all the right notes and the film itself is a comic masterpiece it's finally on video after a long battle over rights do go out and find that version all the 1969 original is good for is clearing out unwanted guests who overstay their welcome br br 1 2 out of 4 stars,0
believe it or not the woodchipper massacre gave me full blown gonorrhea that's right i've got a rainbow of discharge spewing from me just because a group of kids went playing around with a camcorder and somehow made a deal with the devil and got distribution it's beyond my comprehension how anyone with moderate intelligence could tolerate this pant load of a film the only reason i managed to sit through the whole thing not without several suicide attempts along the way was because well first off i was delirious with boredom and second i guess i wanted to further explore this newly discovered type of hate i was experiencing this movie is a 'shot on video' horror comedy about three siblings who are left for the weekend in the care of their bitchy elderly aunt the youngest kid ends up stabbing the old lady accidentally with his rambo replica hunting knife they then get to dismembering auntie with various tools apparently she didn't have a single drop of blood in her body and heave her into their dad's rented wood chipper her convict son then stops by looking for his mom and the kids end up grinding that jackass too i don't recall ever seeing a cast of annoying actors that actually caused me nausea seriously that one blond chick's voice had me wincing in pain constantly all of the actors were downright atrocious literally just screaming their phony sounding dialog and cracking jokes that must've been written by a chimp that just didn't care now i can usually appreciate independent efforts but only from those who can realize that people other than their relatives might be watching this i don't need to see a 3 minute shot of a car pulling out of a drive way and a torturous painfully long lawn grooming montage with some ridiculous fluttery music playing over it plus why the hell does the box of this movie have a bloody piano on it there was a piano in one scene and no one is killed near it i'm through with reminiscing about this movie unless you like insufferable crap i would advise anyone with half a brain to avoid this trash,0
i just watched the movie i was afraid it's gonna disappoint me i was rather surprised at the end though the american pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all times yes it won't be true if i say that i enjoyed it as mush as i enjoyed the original ones beta house along with the previous two pies definitely lost something that the first two pies had it is not gonna become a classic as the first two already did but what the hell it is still funny with a lot of good moments and i think it should be the first movie to pick if you wanna have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school beta house deserves 6 10 but i gave it 7 10 just for being another slice of pie,1
really everybody in this movie looks like they want to be someplace else no wonder the casting is done not with the left hand but rather not at all i haven't seen anything worse than natascha mcelhone impersonating some sort of agent carrying a gun you don't use a spoiled city brat look in such a role the only worse thing i can imagine is casting doris day as a prostitute the rest of the cast is likewise awful possibly with hurt as the sole exception sometimes you can see him trying but suffering oh did i mention that it is a completely insane story jeopardizing many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family well it must be because the guy weller is german br br 2 10 because the photography could be worse,0
i would not have known about this film if not for its surprise oscar nomination for best animated feature film thankfully it came to pass that i was able to watch this animated little treasure br br the story is about the child brendan who was the nephew of the imposing and overprotective abbot of the township of kells the main pre occupation of the abbot is to build a wall to protect kells from the attacking vikings one day aiden the renowned illustrator from iona sought refuge with them aiden opens brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world along the way brendan befriended the white forest sprite aisling as he sought to recover an ancient crystal invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration br br the secret of kells is unlike most of the animation released these days it is a throwback of sorts as the illustrations are done in stark geometric lines and design without much care for realism as much as symbolism the movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic yet fluid animation style used at the beginning sequence of kung fu panda however it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of wonderment for the audience the reds used in the viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting br br try to catch this quiet gem of a film it is a welcome respite from all the senseless bombast of current animated fare such as monsters vs aliens and the like the sparse celtic musical score is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that imbues the film ok the story might be a little shallow and the ending a bit wanting i would have liked to know more about the book that brendan and aiden was working on but the clear star of this film is clearly its amazing stylized artwork said to be based on the artwork in the real book of kells,1
a still famous but decadent actor morgan freeman has not filmed for four years when he is invited to participate in a new project he asks the clumsy cousin of the director to drop him in a poor latin neighborhood in carlson to research the work of the manager of a small supermarket he sees the gorgeous spanish cashier scarlet paz vega and he becomes attracted with her ability his driver never returns to catch him and scarlet gives a ride to the actor but first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared then they spend the afternoon together having a pleasant time br br i am a big fan of morgan freeman and paz vega however the pointless 10 items or less is absolutely disappointing this low budget movie does not seem to have a storyline and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of morgan freeman and paz vega and actually nothing happens along 82 minutes the ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous with the character of morgan freeman returning to his silver spoon world and telling the simple worker that they would never see each other again was he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his family or was a clash of classes and he realizes that his fancy neighborhood would not be adequate to a simple worker from the lower classes my vote is four br br title brazil um astro em minha vida a star in my life,0
kay pollack the man behind this movie is a real great man who tries to share his life philosophy in different ways he has written a bunch of good and well written books about how to control your senses and keep your soul happy the message in most of his books and this movie is about that your thoughts in fact is what causes your problems and that the reason of your anger hardly ever is caused of what you think of the main message is that you can choose to be happy but hardly ever do that br br to watch this movie and learn something very important on life you have to keep your mind very open and l i s t e n to all the hidden messages or guidelines to get through life which most of the parts in this movie contains if you listen and watch watch it with your ears br br you won't learn the meaning of life but you'll learn how to live and get the most out of it br br so while watching please keep in mind br br the mind is like a parachute it doesn't work unless it's open,1
if the answer to this question is yes then you should enjoy this excellent movie i've just seen it a couple of hours ago here in paris where the action of the movie takes place and i can still feel the huge trauma i received in the back of my eyes what a visual shock i've never seen such a beautiful black white photo and such a drastic change in the way of doing animated movies i strongly believe there will a before and after renaissance similarly to what we saw with pixar movies or the akira and ghostintheshell experiences this is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated movies and i hope this french initiative a small unknown french studio with a few young folks who had a dream named renaissance will receive the success and recognition it deserves vive la france,1
does anyone happen to know where this film was shot the aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful it appears to be england however ivy's apartment building certainly looks like the brill building with its fascinating elevators br br charles mendl is listed as playing sir charles gage maybe i blinked but i never saw him perhaps he was the husband's lawyer but again i don't recall that character being in the film other than being mentioned as having made a phone call perhaps he was in the aviation scene or the ballroom scene did anyone spot him br br herbert marshall was 57 years old when he shot this film,1
this has to be one of the worst films of the 1990s when my friends i were watching this film being the target audience it was aimed at we just sat watched the first half an hour with our jaws touching the floor at how bad it really was the rest of the time everyone else in the theatre just started talking to each other leaving or generally crying into their popcorn that they actually paid money they had earnt working to watch this feeble excuse for a film it must have looked like a great idea on paper but on film it looks like no one in the film has a clue what is going on crap acting crap costumes i can't get across how embarrasing this is to watch save yourself an hour a bit of your life,0
summer phoenix did a great performance where you really feel what she's not able to feel and you just cannot understand what she has on her mind besides she portrays a jewish girl who behaves really confronting the status quo of that century,1
this move is about as bad as they come i was however forced to give it a 2 for the scenery there are many great shots of the southwest including many in monument valley one of the most breathtaking places in the us it is also starting with john ford one of the most filmed in fact one scene with kris and the girl was filmed on a place called john ford point,0
this film is pretty awful the only thing stopping me from giving it a rating of 1 was the fact that i unfortunately have seen worse br br the jungle music juttering demons and fluorescent uv style blood teeth eyes give it that awful look and the script is dire this film is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it it's also predictable but not in a good way nothing this film does is in a good way i watched it 10 minutes ago and thought i would rant a bit so there you are oh and the acting doesn't let the film down it's also terrible,0
i watched this movie when joe bob briggs hosted monstervision on tnt even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though it's like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy excruciatingly painful br br if you took the actual film dipped it in paint thinner then watched it it would be more entertaining seriously br br if you see this movie in the bargin bin at s mart back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake,0
star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br marshall lawson steven seagal is assigned to france on a reconaissance mission along with three new young strike team recruits after disobeying a direct order from above however the night before they're due to strike they are all found grusomely slaughtered by a killer with seemingly inhuman strength with the french police dallying around with their own investigation he goes in search of those responsible himself only to uncover a corrupt faction of the military dealing in a deadly new drug that alters a person's dna and gives them terrifying new strength br br bad cover bad title bad post production tampering and bad trailer pretty bad film but i've got to say i don't think attack force is quite his worst i know this will make me unpopular with most of the other reviewers here perhaps not steveday but i think a lot of the criticism has stemmed from all the bad news that went before the film rather than the actual quality of it itself br br i must say there was nowhere near as much dubbing or ropey editing as i'd been lead to believe the dubbing there was which made him sound like martin sheen with a groin problem was pretty awful and quite frequent but not in use for as large a segment of the film as i'd thought the plot flowed pretty smoothly as well considering all the messing about with the original finished film called harvester that went on also as another reviewer noted the film has a nice gothic look to it a new touch for a seagal film br br the absolute killer low point though was the complete and total lack of any exciting action with only a few poorly filmed fight scenes for any fun br br i have to be honest though i would rather watch this again than flight of fury today you die or out for a kill,0
this is a film of immense appeal to a relatively well defined group of which i am not a part i went to a preview of this movie not knowing what to expect i ultimately found it disappointing the history of a dreadfully dysfunctional oftentimes downright twisted hungarian jewish family is not my cup of tea an epic saga like this should really provide its viewers with something more in the end ultimately pictures such as this are about the human condition this picture cast almost no new light on any of its more meaningful facets,0
this is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen it is not funny it is not interesting and should not have been made,0
jack lemmon and walter matthau began and ending their career together remember best as the grumpiest of old men as well as the oddest couple to have ever made us laugh lemmon and matthau were one of hollywood's best loved comedy teams of the last 100 years not as raunchy as pryor and wilder instead they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern marx brothers routine such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that marx chaplin and keaton were so famous for in the odd couple lemmon and matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos the physical comedy is as unique as chaplins the joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another not your typical guy film it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime the chemistry between lemmon and matthau is entertainment enough although this movie isn't for everyone this is a great comedy,1

magnolia is a preposterous bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little like eyes wide shut magnolia is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence the camera swoops through hallways and corridors catching glimpses of sad characters where is the reason to care for these people the common theme seems to be people who yell a lot who can't care for others except for john c reilly's and philip seymour hoffman's characters and are self destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying i was reminded of how much i disliked shine because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by armin mueller stahl there are so many unattractive unappealing characters here why would we want to spend time with them br br having said that there is nothing held back about magnolia paul thomas anderson's ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon there are two ideas in particular that bomb both happen in the last hour of this 188 minute film one has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of aimee mann's coffeehouse folk songs sweet but ineffectual since we can't see what strings them all together the other idea i refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous br br magnolia has a lot of great acting particularly tom cruise who unleashes a performance i didn't know he had in him and john c reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory but it all adds up to nothing when the secret unexpected event happened a girl behind me in the theatre couldn't hold it in any more and said this is stupid my feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree,0
anyone notice that tommy only has 3 facial expressions br br 1 the angry eyes look he gives every enemy 2 the holding of the hands to face mouth agape and frightened eyes 3 the smiling tommy turnbull br br i have to say that i pretty much hate this show i don't watch it but it's like code lyoko we've all watched at least one i must say that this show is borderline racist uninteresting and pointless br br every episode ends with robotboy winning except for one exception when robotboy basically let this overly geeky freakazoid fly away on a jetpack br br the jokes are pretty crude too i think it's mostly people saying the word suck or farting i think the bullies of the show are quite shocking too br br isn't there one that hides a bowling ball under his hate and the other uses a chain for god sake what kind of school is he going to not to mention his older brother who is borderline psychopathic and has no other character qualities br br the whole show i feel is ripping off megas xlr and fosters like you could say the trio of coop jamie and kiva as well as robotboy being similar to megas where he beats everyone no matter what the odds and he's free spirited despite being a robot br br there is simply no appeal to this show i'm surprised that it's still running,0
'una giornata particolare' is a movie that has a title that sounds so familiar i thought i had seen it more than once now that i finally i have seen it i am very glad this is one of the better italian movies i know with one of the most wonderful performances by marcello mastroianni who stars in other masterpieces such as 'la dolce vita' and '8 1 2' both from the great federico fellini directed by ettore scola this is a movie that takes the time to introduce the characters and slowly develops a story on a special day the day adolf hitler visited rome br br marcello mastroianni plays gabriele the neighbor of antonietta sophia loren she is a member of mussolini's party pretty fanatic in her thoughts and he is a member no more the reason for that i will not reveal on the day every person from their building including her husband and children is out to see hitler they are still in the building antonietta's bird escapes and flies to gabriele's apartment and this is how the two meet right before antonietta went to gabriele he thought of killing himself again for reasons i will not reveal how the story develops from here i will not reveal but it is what happens between the two that makes this such a special day not the fact that hitler is in rome br br like i said mastroianni has a wonderful performance you see he is a man who desperately wants someone around him although at first we don't know why may be he likes antonietta may be he is in love with her may be there are other reasons antonietta feels what we feel what does this man want from her she likes the attention anyway we see how she does her hair to look attractive for the man loren plays the scenes very good as well we understand her questions although we can't be sure what her intentions are the moments where we find out both their secrets if that is what you can call it is a great moment how the story develops from there is even more interesting but i don't want to spoil it for you this is a movie you should see great performances and a beautiful cinematography and the message it gives us still stands today,1
the first look on the cover of this picture it looks like a good rock n roll movie but don't let the cover fool you or the fact that alice cooper and blondie is in it the storyline is just horrible and so is the acting plain and simple bad br br it's not a movie about a roadie its just a thin love story so awful that you see right through it the only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack some good songs and that is why i give 2 out of 10 if it wasn't for the music it would of been 0 out of 10 meat loaf is a horrible actor at least he was in 1980 and the girl who plays the groupie isn't even good looking this movie was a huge disappointment for me because it makes a lot of good promises,0
this really was the worst movie i have ever seen michael vartan is hot but who is this woman and she looks absolutely awful through the whole movie the hair is so bad they talk in like monotone voices and there is nooo chemistry the cover of the dvd does not even remotely come close to what the movie actually is really really boring i had to fast forward through some of it because it was so painful to watch i really want to know how i on earth anyone could think this is good hhaha they literally just like talk and say yeah and there is no passion whatsoever i could not tell at all that they were in love i'm sorry but this was the saddest excuse for a movie i think i have ever seen,0
this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen i'm still not sure if it was serious or just a satire one of those movies that uses every stupid who dunnit cliché they can think of arrrrgh br br don johnson was pretty good in it actually but otherwise it sucked it was over 10 years ago that i saw it but it still hurts and won't stop lingering in my brain br br the last line in the movie really sums up how stupid it is i won't ruin it for you should you want to tempt fate by viewing this movie but i garantee you a nghya moment at the end with a few in between if you have nothing better to do and you like to point and laugh then maybe it might be worth your while additionally if you're forced to go on a date with someone you really don't like suggest watching this movie together and they'll probably leave you alone after they see it that's a fair price to pay i guess,0
though frank loesser's songs are some of the finest that broadway has to offer they're bollixed by joseph l mankiewicz' lethargic staging and uninspired presentation when it's over it barely feels like you've watched a musical mankiewicz doesn't seem to know how to present loesser's challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect for example one of the best numbers the showstopping adelaide's lament' concludes by having adelaide vivian blaine belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge and stubby kaye's faux spiritual sit down you're rockin' the boat' has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue adapted from abe burrows' stage book has none of the wit that his films like all about eve' have part of the blame has to go to the leads just about all of whom are miscast marlon brando looks bewildered as to why he's in a musical frank sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential the songs are not tailored to his style and jean simmons barely registers the way a shirley jones might only blaine as the lovelorn showgirl adelaide commands our attention like a broadway pro should the colorful art direction is by joseph wright and howard bristol created the flashy sets,0
i don't think this movie is for everyone but i saw it this weekend in seattle and i thought it was so funny i haven't laughed that hard during a movie in long time i thought the entire cast did a great job you will find yourself laughing from the first moment through the very last scene i suspect some moviegoers especially the ones who take themselves way too seriously will be turned off by this brand of humor not me the movie was a real surprise and the entire theater was rolling with laughter throughout the showing i went to which makes me think that a lot of people enjoyed themselves and were happy to have a good time at the movies for a change i cannot wait to see it again if you're in the mood to lol then this is for you funny funny funny funny,1
this movie is good for what it is and unpretentious i wouldn't watch it twice however i am a peter cushing completist and that's why i watched it the best asset of this movie is brevity and effectiveness compared to other similar movies it does not drag its feet forever as each of the four plus one segments lasts under 30 minutes with the last under 10 good uncanny vibes in the first segment horror writer suffering from 'writer's block' relocates to secluded old house seeking inspiration he finds even too much of it when he starts to visualize one of his fictional madmen plot contrivance similar to premature burial good use of the point of view twist is the writer getting mentally ill or as the ending shows his trophy wife wants her lover to play along with the husband's phobias to drive him mad secure his estates yet will the scheming bimbo survive to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious plan br br in the second segment two long time lost friends get together in the same secluded old house but cannot seem to help visiting a bizarre horror museum featuring the wax statue of the long lost love of their youth which had once separated them from the gothic museum keeper they learn the woman portrayed is a deceased ax wielding murderer or was she br br the third segment was the less interesting to me br br the fourth shows a horror movies actor who thinks he's the best of all sunken to the depths of low budget c movies seeking a costume to lend more credibility to his fictional vampire he gets the real deal this segment also lacks the solidity of the first two br br acting is fair with the 2 initial segments contributing the bulk of it good movie taken with a grain of salt not the best cushing nor lee but worth watching,1
at the name of pinter every knee shall bow especially after his nobel literature prize acceptance speech which did little more than regurgitate canned by the numbers sixth form anti americanism but this is even worse not only is it a tour de force of talentlessness a superb example of how to get away with coasting on your decades old reputation but it also represents the butchery of a superb piece the original sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind yes it was a theatrical confection and it is easy to see how it's central plot device would work better on the stage than the screen but it still worked terrifically well this is a michael caine vanity piece but let's face it caine is no olivier not only can he not fill larry's shoes he couldn't even fill his bathroom slippers the appropriately named caine is after all a distinctly average actor whose only real recommendation like so many british actors is their longevity in the business he was a good harry palmer excellent in get carter but that's yer lot mate give this a very wide berth and stick to the superb original this is more of a half pinter,0
two sisters their perverted brother and their cousin have car trouble they then happen about the home of dr hackenstein whom conveniently needs the body parts of three nubile young women to use in an experiment to bring his deceased lover back to life he tells them that he'll help them get home in the morning so they spend the night then the good doctor gets down to work in this low budget horror comedy br br i found this to be mildly amusing nothing at all to actually go out of your way for i stumbled across it on netflix instant view streamed it to the xbox 360 but better then i expected it to be for a troma acquired film most of the humor doesn't work but their are still some parts that caused me to smile plus the late great anne ramsey has a small part and she was always a treat to watch br br eye candy bambi darro sylvia lee baker got topless br br my grade d,0
parker johnathan schaech is an aspiring writer who is still looking for his big break in the meantime he works as a telephone adviser for a manhattan psychic hotline one day most unfortunately his apartment building burns down parker and his cat make it out alive but are now stuck with the arduous task of finding affordable housing in the big apple word comes to parker that a lady samantha alison eastwood is searching for a roommate but will only accept a gay male since parker is straight but the price is right he decides to pretend that he is gay samantha likes him from the start and welcomes him as her new cohabitant but poor parker sam is lovely intelligent and very desirable how will he be able to keep his true nature under control besides doesn't sam have a successful businessman boyfriend anyway this is a sweet likable and humorous film with two very attractive stars in eastwood and schaech naturally the plot is a string of how can i keep up this ruse scenes with sam asking parker for shampoo while she is showering or pleading with him to hold her in bed when she receives bad news also it is necessary for parker to produce his own fake gay mate boris when sam insists upon fixing him up with a man she knows hopefully the gay community will not find this too offensive as this viewer thought most issues were treated with sensitivity and subtlety for a small scale movie the costumes sets and camera work were quite nice also therefore if you love those funny tales of love get this one soon you will like what you see i know it,1
and i do mean it if not literally after all i have not seen every movie ever created at least obviously among the ones the many i know br br 5 3 the rule of thumb with imdb is this sometimes movies rated very highly for example the piece of kannes kompetition krowned korean kraap called oldboy can be truly bad but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6 this movie very much worth watching is a disgrace br br true i give it a 10 in protest the movie is not perfect its true rating should be an 8 or a 9 it has some acting flaws belafonte especially the script wanders around sometimes however what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times the czech jan kadar directing two of the greatest actors of all time the beloved larger than life zero mostel and the sublime ida kaminska in an acting poetic moral tour de force a pair made in heaven it's true that this movie little flaws apart does not pander to the average audiences but those interested in watching an excellent while again not beyond criticism movie of the incomparable director who gave us the shop on the main street the best movie ever about holocaust should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that american beauty is better than the angel levine br br it isn't,1
perhaps i'm out of date or just don't know what electra is like in current publications but the electra that i read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan she usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way br br this movie was fairly weak on the dialog the acting wasn't particularly convincing and the action was spotty i was really looking for something more along the lines of frank miller's book electra assassin which is much darker than anything in this movie br br special effect where cool action was interesting at times but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical tha hand was not menacing enough and electra was not bitchy enough she's the girl you love to hate but in this story i just didn't care either way,0
this is another example of a sucky sequel to a great movie i highly recommend the prophecy but this movie was a dud from the start the acting was decent all the way around but the story line was weak and added nothing to the origional a 4 out of 10 at best,0
unwatchable you can't even make it past the first three minutes and this is coming from a huge adam sandler fan 1,0
i didn't really know what this movie was about when i went to the theater to see it hype about the satanism etc etc etc as the trailers in the last movie i saw looked pretty interesting br br oh dear roman catholic mythology not my idea of a good scare and honestly i just felt like watching a really good scary movie not some loosely plotted religious farce that tries to score cheap thrills by having some chick getting bloody every few minutes br br i'll try to keep away from the spoilers but i found it very odd that an atheist who gets a string of rosary beads from a deceased priest could suddenly end up with christ's wounds aren't stigmata supposed to be deeply religious i mean she hangs out with losers does loser stuff behaves like a typical rebel et al and here she is displaying the wounds of jesus christ come on br br scenes of her crucified head thrown back screaming blood everywhere became rather tedious after seeing it a dozen times it was neither frightening or scary just repulsive it did however become quite painful to watch those flicking scenes were highly annoying br br conclusion if your a catholic defintly don't see this if you're not still don't see it,0
this has to be the most brutally unfunny comedy i've ever seen in my life ben stiller jack black and christopher walken as a crazed homeless man can't make me laugh something's got to be wrong with this picture this is the only movie i've ever felt like walking out of i used free passes and still felt like i wanted my money back i can wholeheartedly say that the only movie i've ever seen worse than this one was house of the dead the only worse movie i laughed very slightly at the merry go round scene and that's it spending 2 hours in something billed as a comedy should get you more than one laugh right i don't know i guess the filmmakers thought that flan was a funny word or something and the other running joke really is beating a dead horse literally,0
i have seen dirty work several times and is probably my favourite stan and ollie short br br in this one stan and ollie are chimney sweeps and get the job to clean the chimney at the home of professor noodle lucien littlefield while noodle is doing mad experiments in his lab stan and ollie cause much chaos trying to clean the chimney and make a mess of the living room the end is where ollie falls into a tank of special formula that noodle uses for his experiments and this turns him into a chimp the best part is where ollie falls down the chimney and loads of bricks land on his head but he doesn't seem to suffer much pain from this br br dirty work is stan and ollie at their funniest great fun br br rating 5 stars out of 5,1
this is one of the most overlooked gems hollywood has ever produced a young wwii british fighter ace whose plane is about to crash has radio contact with a young american woman who comforts the brave pilot knowing that within minutes he will be dead for some reason the man who should certainly be dead walks away from the wreckage and eventually learns that he was meant to report to heaven when a messanger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven the man refuses and demands to have his day in court to argue his case the man argues that his situation had changed during the final moments of his earthly life that he had fallen in love and therefor had become a different person one who deserved a chance to live on br br the heavenly court is a cinematic delight the announcement of the jury of peers is a definite highlight the story as fantastic as it seems is an engaging one and will keep you spellbound for the nearly 2 hours play time the final scene is simply beautiful and will require a kleenex treatment for most viewers this film is in my personal all time favorite top 10 it has my highest recommendation,1
what is this is it a comedy a horror movie or just nothing this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen especially the scene in romania when he becomes the werewolf that must be the worst scene that has ever been made this movie isn't funny it isn't scary and not entertaining at all please do yourself and me i don't think anyone should suffer through this movie a favour and don't watch this movie if you get is a present just throw it away and chop it in to pieces,0
part of the enjoyment that i took from this film stemmed from the fact that i knew nothing more about it than that it starred john turturro and emily watson 2 reasons enough to watch was a period piece and involved chess everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected i shan't therefore give away much more suffice to say that turturro is magnificent as an eccentric obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and em matches him step for step as the strong minded woman who is drawn to him it's about love and obsession rather than the venerated board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour became totally compelling and i defy anyone to second guess the ending,1
what can i say about this film other than don't see it i waited and waited and waited for someting or anything to happen and it just didn't come watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie what are they doing are they solving a mystery are they gathering clues possibly it's just hard to tell at the end of the movie after a lot of radio signals are decoded illegibly on some sort of pet monitor and this guy gives some lectures the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth i guess they don't like sharing the wealth my guess is they finished filming and saw their 35 minute work or art garbage and decided that they'd let the editing crew turn it into an 88 minute feature film watch at your own peril it's not even funny because it's so bad it's just bad,0
i watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare and i have to say it did not deserve it br br parinda was so hyped that i was really looking forward to watch it br br parinda is one of those movies which fail to satisfy the standards set by other good indian film makers despite having a great story it was even more pathetic to know that the story itself was not original it was loosely based on the classic on the waterfront br br anil kapoor was irritating especially when he comes from america the direction lacked quality many a times except a few in between scenes br br give this script to any of them ram gopal verma deepa mehta mahesh bhatt sudhir mishra and i'm 100 sure they'll make a mind blowing movie out of it br br i'm not saying parinda was bad it was just not good enough,0
i will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about to prevent it from happening again i agree with the comments from the gentleman from uk the movie was pretty terrible all cliché no real plot historical and technical inaccuracies abound look up the technical specs on de 529 or any everts class destroyer escort and you will see what i mean i now its black history month in the us and im going to be called a racist just for saying this but the history of this ship is not that great they did some escort work chased a submarine that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed sorry but black people did a lot more in wwii then this silly movie gives them credit for this movie makes them look like whiners let the name calling commence i can handle it,0
while the 'special effects' and technical attributes of this movie may in fact be laughable to some i have never been able to erase the images this movie etched on my young and impressionable mind when i first saw it at around 8 years of age the story of this girl's survival and of the trials she endured have stayed with me all these years and i have thought back on more than one occasion about how the girl made it out of situations far beyond anything i have seen br br the fact that this is a true story and the fact that i was only a child when i first saw this may be the reason behind my high rating of this movie each time this movie aired on television in the 70s and 80s i would be riveted to the television drinking in each scene with an interest i cannot explain i suppose watching this for the first time as an adult and with a jaded view of the world it may not be as enjoyable to some i actually went out of my way to obtain a copy so i could show this movie to my son br br this like many other movies is not for everyone if you are impressed by remarkable human survival stories are partial to peru macchu picchu and or the amazon then i believe you might enjoy this movie as much as i have been enjoying it for the past 30 years,1
strange i like all this movie crew and dark humor movies but didn't like this one at all it's awful horrible and surely not funny at all pity cannot do a whole movie plot disgust either and it was really boring long empty moments fills the movie it could have been removed it should have been in another shorter format surely maybe i expected too much from the crew like saving the movie lol it's also filled with overused clichés of characters and situations i don't get it why people liked it poetry hope nope 'mam didn't see anything like that all in all it's empty and crude pitiful and hopeless oh darn this one,0
when i first saw this film in london in 1958 i was bowled over i had never seen a film like this before it had a strange hypnotic effect quite unlike the films that i had seen previously and it left a lasting impact br br i believe that odile versios marina vlady are sisters if not twins certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer br br if this has been converted to dvd in region 2 format and in the original french language i would love to hear about it where it can be purchased,1
this movie is very underrated it's highly imaginative creative and clever it's just plain fun and in my opinion this film tops the first one but the film was forgotten when it first came out and became even more overlooked as the years passed bill ted's bogus journey also bombed at the box office whereas the first one was a pretty good hit and very popular br br i think the problem may be that this film was just released a couple years too late in 1991 bill and ted already seemed so '80s even though the '80s were only a couple years ago back at that time the landscape of the music and style for kids had changed so radically with gangsta rap hip hop pearl jam nirvana grunge and the seattle sound bill and ted with their ozzy osbourne van halen and guns n' roses music along with their '80s style seemed so out of place and very outdated in '91 and i think that's one big reason the film bombed at the box office nobody but surfers were still saying stuff like excellent and bogus in 1991 gremlins 2 which also came out in the early '90s suffered a similar fate of being a good film that bombed at the box office because it was too associated with the '80s the transition from the '80s to the '90s was a much faster change then now with the '90s and '00s 1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989 whereas right now 2002 and last year 2001 still looks looked like 1995 or 1996 br br if only excellent adventure which was made in 1988 was released that year instead of 1989 and bogus journey was made quickly and released in 1989 then it too would have probably been just as wildly received as the first,1
cinderella is one of disney's greatest films one of those films i think you appreciate more the older you get disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairytale i consider the film to have been the greatest of his films at the time of its release the characters became more dimensional than earlier films creating more depth to appreciate the characters more cinderella herself is in my opinion one of the greatest characters disney ever created with her kindness and dash of dry humor she is extremely likeable however it is the inspiration she provides which makes her memorable like many people she is an endless dreamer and she holds onto her dreams never giving up even in the most adverse of situations her dreams endure and she won't let anyone take that away from her her example should serve as inspiration to everyone and encouragement to never let go of your dreams,1
this inept adaptation of arguably one of martin amis's weaker novels fails to even draw comparisons with other druggy oeuvres such as requiem for a dream or anything penned by irvine walsh as it struggles to decide whether it is a slap stick cartoon or a hyper realistic hallucination br br boringly directed by william marsh in over saturated hues a group of public school drop outs converge in a mansion awaiting the appearance of three american friends for a weekend of decadent drug taking and that's it except for the ludicrous sub plot soon to be the main plot nonsense about an extremist cult group who express themselves with the violent killings of the world's elite figures be it political or pampered within the first reel you know exactly where this is going br br what is a talented actor like paul bettany doing in this tiresome badly written bore made prior to his rise to fame and jennifer connelly one can be assured that had he been offered this garbage now he'd have immediately changed agents avoid,0
this movie is another horror anthology it is rather good but it could have used a bit more i compare it to doctor terror's house of horrors though in this one the title fits it has four stories all somewhat connected by a house the first tale is about a writer and his wife moving in he creates a killer for his latest novel and then he starts seeing the killer roaming around in his house this one is sort of predictable but it does throw a few twists in the end the next story is a bit more unpredictable and you really do not know where the heck it is going this one features peter cushing and was probably my favorite of the bunch this guy buys the house but it is not the house that takes center stage but a rather strange wax museum the third story starts out rather good and features christopher lee this one has him as a rather bizarre dad who seems awfully protective of his daughter the problem is that once you know what is going on the story does not end soon enough it drags a bit leading to a very predictable conclusion then the final tale concerns an actor buying a cloak from an odd little shop the actor really gets what he paid for then there is a small story about an officer who is seen throughout trying to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why these things happened though i was not very satisfied with the explanation as i don't think it really explained cushing's story much at all i think they needed a bit more back story for that one all in all though it was an interesting set of stories,1
i grew up watching and loving tng i just recently finished watching the entire series st voyager on dvd which may have heightened my sense of disgust with this episode as the difference in style and approach between the two shows couldn't be more stark the idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand riker's character which is how it probably would have been treated on voy they could have featured memories that would be new to the audience rather than simply regurgitating old show clips the in and out transitions between the memories and the present in this episode start as cliché in the beginning and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern wears on and on bar none worst episode ever,0
i would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it weren't for ms claudine barretto's performance and i will take this time to overlook that kris aquino's here and end br br i really avoid watching pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that some writers don't give enough attention to the characters and their progression in their stories redundant it was as if they 'pushed' the movie onwards when their storytelling stank and my goodness creative exhaustion led them to rip off other movies why why did this movie get a good review i wouldn't give it that much merit the movie was kind of scary but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with filipino folklore it goes into my list of 'most likely to happen' category i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences never mind if the lighting sucked it wouldn't matter much if the content would blow you away sayang,0
the last hard men finds james coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang do he and his friends head for the mexican border from jail and safety no they don't because coburn has a mission of revenge to kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman br br that peace officer is charlton heston who is now retired and he knows what coburn is after as he explains it to his daughter barbara hershey coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a waco like standoff his indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired it's not something he's proud of she was a collateral casualty in a manhunt br br lest we feel sorry for coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is heston is his usual stalwart hero but the acting honors in the last hard men go to james coburn he blows everyone else off the screen when he's on br br coburn gets the bright idea of making sure heston trails him by kidnapping hershey and taking her to an indian reservation where the white authorities can't touch him he knows that heston has to make it personal then br br coburn's gang includes morgan paull thalmus rasulala john quade larry wilcox and jorge rivero heston has chris mitchum along who is his son in law to be br br the last hard men is one nasty and brutal western andrew mclaglen directed it and i'm thinking it may have been a project originally intended for sam peckinpaugh it sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence of which there is a lot br br for a little peckinpaugh lite the last hard men is your film,1
the '60s is an occasionally entertaining film most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film it is extremely uneven and includes many annoying elements take for instance the switch between black white and color if done right this could of been fairly effective but because it was done poorly it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience much of the film had an odd feel to it the acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for tv flick but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times many of the events were not coherent and ending up being confusing how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's the ending was much too sappy for my tastes because it was hollywoodized everything had to turn out right in the end i would advise you to not waste your time on the '60s and do something else with your time i'm glad i watched this in class and not on my own time i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylan's music those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick i hope you take my advice and stay away from this,0
i recently viewed manufactured landscapes at the seattle international film festival i was drawn to the movie as a photographer because i'm both familiar and a fan of burtynsky's work while i believe the movie does a good job getting it's message across i couldn't help but feel that it was made as a complete afterthought to the photographs and subsequent popular book by burtynsky obviously one reason for this is the extensive use of still photographs featuring zooms and pans across them while this is a good effect when used economically i felt like 75 of the movie was just stills from burtynsky's book which i already own that's probably an exaggeration but that's how i felt if you own the book or are familiar with his work you might be better off skipping this one,0
i stopped five minutes in when beowulf was given a double shot automatic crossbow with sights on it not only do crossbows not have telescoping sights but beowulf beat grendel in hand to hand combat the terrible wooden acting and eternal darkness that plagues all sci fi original movies didn't help either having only gotten a few minutes in before i felt my bile rise and decided to watch i love lucy reruns instead that's really about all i have to say but you might as well just realize that it's a made for tv movie and skip it right there br br a travesty,0
horrible film about an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl boring tatum o neil goes through the motions in her part and has some of the corniest lines in film history richard burton looks close to death in this film and we're supposed to believe he looks good for sixty the acting is bad as is the plot the characters are awful as is the story it's really hard to feel for anyone in this film except larry ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on tatum he's kind of funny this movie is really a waste of time if you are a tatum fan like me which is why i rented it in the first place please don't see this movie she is really bad in it and you'll wonder if maybe paper moon was a fluke it wasn't because of bad news bears and little darlings it's known she can act well but still don't rent this movie and if you're a fan of burton rent something when he was good looking and not a fossil,0
i am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself but i just got back from this movie and felt i had to express my opinions let me start by saying that i am a huge horror fan but what makes a horror movie i sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development i know they often lack in horror movies but prom night looked like it didn't even put forth any effort in that department next we all love suspense that on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises yeah prom night had none of that of course we like a terrifying killer prom night have that nope it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife and when all else fails at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore and the occasional nude scene yeah well when you have a horror movie rated pg 13 like prom night they leave that stuff out too so with all of these elements missing i ask does this still count as a horror movie nope i'd call it more of a comedy people in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when i saw semi pro that was supposed to actually be a comedy which also sucked but thats another story i think i am just going to have to give up on new horror all the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money the people i went to see it with didn't even know this was a remake which made me mad i wonder what will happen when there's no more movies to remake where will horror go next,0
with lots of sunshine gauzy light and shadow filtering through windows and into rooms tracking shots moving through crowds with hand held camera quick paced editing and extreme close ups here and there the photography is the thing in this interesting artistically done film br br the plot of this film starts out as a bit of fluff about a beauty contest the film begins on a warm sunday at the local swimming pool where we meet the lovely lucienne aka lulu played by louise brooks a bit of a show off in front of the gawking men by poolside she soon decides to enter herself to represent france in the miss europe beauty contest much to the chagrin of her very jealous stick in the mud fiancé a pretty annoying fellow really strutting down the runway the ten contestants display themselves in swimsuits while the winner is chosen as the contestant who receives the longest applause i was wondering couldn't the girls just walk slower to prolong their length of time and thus applause on the catwalk lulu is soon being chased by a prince and a maharaja but her hot headed beau doesn't like the attentions paid to her by other men or her adoring public for that matter i guess he just wants her in his house cooking his meals and staying out of sight eh br br louise brooks is beautiful and charming her presence helps enhance this film but it's really the way it is photographed that held my interest the most a bit distracting is the odd dubbed sound which is a bit off the print on this version looked very clear and full of nice contrast though watching this i just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the film visually and i found the movie to be excellent well worth seeing,1
it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing the first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go you shouldn't really decide to watch this based on my review or not i saw so little of it i shouldn't even really be commenting but suddenly it all became clear why the video shop guy was sniggering at us paying money to see it br br couldn't they have just made earnest does dallas,0
the mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the 80's well with some good performances br br however br br the script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where i expect it was intended to be edgy the characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichés that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front the biggest problem is this movie has no real story it ticks all the right arty boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point was br br very disappointing,0
the action in this movie beats sunny bhai in gadar akshay kumar possess the superpowers of leonidus in 300 neo in matrix along with spiderman and superman it is hilarious except for the typical akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedy i cannot see anything positive in this film the story looks like the writer told his 10yr old son to write the movie is so unreal that anil kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director except for the directors tashan to make this movie there is no other tashan i regret wasting my money on this movie and i would not recommend it to anybody 1 10 is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero,0
at your video store you might find this gem br br the human condition in modern times la no exaggerated drama just a collapsing of events that might happen to any group of individuals over time br br helps you understand the joys and desperation of urban life br br the direction and cutting are top class cinematography and music very much follows the mood and situation and the cast br br excellent casting and excellent acting no one out of place or out of character br br and it's not really as much a downer as you would expect i gave it 7 of 10 br br if you havent seen it do,1
i remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television i remember the premise of the movie being about a bunch of hotel occupants being attacked by man eating ants what i didn't remember was how awful it was br br i recently caught this movie on television late at night i'm sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existance and are never to be found again suzanne somers at the pinnacle of her career playing chrissy on 'three's company' plays a vacationer at lakewood manor constructions workers are installing a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturb an ants' nest or should i say a man eating ants' nest one of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants one minute he's picking them off his clothes one by one the next minute he's covered in them the next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt br br if you thought that was pretty far fetched you should see myrna loy playing a wheel chair bound resident who gets airlifted out of the manor via helicopter i could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting airlifted out of the movie br br the final scenes depict suzanne robert foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other blowing through straws and covered in ants br br that's basically the movie there's really no disaster appeal or big star draw to the film it was intended to be a 'grand scale' television event at the time now it's lucky if it gets dumped in a 4 00am timeslot on your local television station br br if you want to catch suzanne somers at her best then watch an episode of three's company if you want to see myrna loy doing anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills then watch this movie br br 0 10,0
two sorcerers battle in the fourth dimension one brian thompson as a kabal trying to destroy the earth the other jeffrey combs as a anton mordrid trying to save it doctor mordrid is an enjoyable fantasy fare which offers plenty of cheese the plot is pretty silly and the gore is completely absent but the film is very short and entertaining so if you have enough time to kill give this one a look my rating 7 out of 10,1
i am not a parent neither am i a male but i was able to identify with every character's heartaches and pains br br this is a movie teenagers should watch maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again i'm sorry for those that don't understand the value of love family and friendship br br it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing and it is great to see a 19 year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance he showed at an early age that he is capable of heartfelt drama he should be offered more serious roles note hollywoodland his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in 2006 br br this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages maybe shouldn't be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families but i recommend it to the entire family br br i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times because it portrays the values that are important in life,1
jim belushi is terrific as the average joe who gets his 15 minutes in the twilight zone michael cane is the mysterious bar tender who not only listens to belushi's story but has a cure for all of belushi's middle class problems a magic potion to bring about an avalanche of changes in belushi's life br br flashbacks show a 15 year old horribly ashamed of causing his high school baseball team's championship defeat belushi goes on with his pitiful life seemingly happy but always wondering what if for what seems to be several days belushi experiences a different life one of enormous success admired and hated by others in equal measure br br this is not quite it's a wonderful life but some elements are similar and very endearing the ending is predictable but still satisfying watch for a very young cortney cox in a bit part as fatal attraction like other woman a very pleasant film,1
the show is really funny nice theme jokes and one liners are really good with little extra tuning it can become a very popular show but the only major negative point of this show is the cast david spade does a great job as russell megyn price does a good job but who the hell did cast patrick warburton oliver hudson and bianca kajlich br br technically russell and jeff are the main characters of the show which make viewers wanna watch the show russell is a playboy and jeff is a kind of frustrated family man the relationship wiz with an experience of all the problems a married couple face in a relationship br br patrick warburton does a horrible job as jeff he is not at all suited for the role he is like a robot literally there is no punch in his dialog delivery br br cast is really very important for viewers to like it the bad acting certainly will take the show downhill,1
this has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an austen novel although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular pride and prejudice emma is a lush and relatively faithful tv version of austen's novel especially considering its short length the biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one as the unnecessary snobbishness that austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to emma's character in the rest of the book i thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well picked kate beckinsale walks the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in gwyneth paltrow's '96 version samantha morton's wispy blonde locks suit her attitude and character as the simper that accompanies her role in previous characterisations is replaced with the harriet we know from the book mister knightly's role is carried out extremely well in my opinion both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this much neglected sumptuous film,1
what a fun movie st ives is it reminds me of the type of film made during the 40's classic story rounded off by characters and a plot that is neither over dramatic nor overtly complicated in fact it isn't over anything robert lewis stevenson's story here adapted for the screen reads like jane austen for men we do get a tale that has a romance at its heart but there is plenty of fun too battle scenes sort of prison escapes mistaken identities swordplay and the funniest line i've heard in years only in scotland would guests be announced by name at a masked ball there is much hilarity hardship and not a little heartbreak as st ives tries to fight and find his way back to a family and life he barely knew br br the cast is absolutely stellar with the too infrequently seen jean marc barr absolutely perfect in the title role anna friel is a refreshing delight as the resourceful flora and miranda richardson nearly walks away with the movie as her wise and worldly been there and seen it all aunt susan richard grant provides comic relief of the highest order br br this is not going to be the greatest movie anyone has ever seen but its charms are undeniable and the entire film fairly bristles with an energy that bursts with life,1
this movie is not good the first one almost sucked but had that unreal ending to make it worth watching this one has nothing there's zero scare zero tension or suspense this isn't really a horror movie most of the kills don't show anything there's no gore to speak of this could almost be a tv except for a bit of nudity and a bit of violence the acting is not very good either and don't get me started on the dialogue as for the surprise ending surprise there isn't one i suppose it could have been worse although i don't see how but then again it is less than 80 minutes long so i guess that's a good thing although it felt a lot longer apparently this is the cut version of the film i found it for a very cheap price but it still not worth it if you want the uncut more graphic version check out the anchor bay edition anyway this version of sleepaway camp ii unhappy campers gets a big fat 1 10 from me p s if you watch this movie you will probably be a bored and unhappy camper if you are a real fan you might want to pick up anchor bay's sleepaway camp with survival kit three disc collection containing the first three movies uncut and with special features,0
boasting an all star cast so impressive that it almost seems like the mad mad mad mad world of horror pictures the sentinel 1977 is nevertheless an effectively creepy film centering on the relatively unknown actress cristina raines in this one she plays a fashion model alison parker who moves into a brooklyn heights brownstone that is and i don't think i'm giving away too much at this late date very close to the gateway of hell and as a tenant in this building she suffers far worse conditions than leaky plumbing and the occasional water bug to put it mildly indeed the scene in which alison encounters her noisy upstairs neighbor is truly terrifying and should certainly send the ice water coursing down the spines of most viewers despite many critics' complaints regarding raines' acting ability i thought she was just fine more than ably holding her own in scenes with ava gardner burgess meredith arthur kennedy chris sarandon and eli wallach the picture builds to an effectively eerie conclusion and although some plot points go unexplained i was left feeling more than satisfied as the book dvd delirium puts it any movie with beverly d'angelo and sylvia miles as topless cannibal lesbians in leotards can't be all bad on a side note yesterday i walked over to 10 montague terrace in brooklyn heights to take a look at the sentinel house yes it's still there and although shorn of its heavy coat of ivy and lacking a blind priest nun at the top floor window looks much the same as it did in this picture if this house really does sit atop the entrance to hell i take it that hell is the brooklyn queens expressway but we new yorkers have known that for some time,1
this docu drama is what you would expect from richard attenborough the man who gave us gandhi beautifully photographed compellingly casted well written in the measured literate manner that hollywood discarded in the 30's and scrupulously accurate it stands out as a genre film excelling in its portrayal of native american or more appropriately for its canadian setting first nations culture and standing with black robe as a wonderfully photographed piece of canoe country and its culture here circa 1934 this idyllic portrait derives drama from its subject archie grey owl belaney a scot raised in hastings england by maiden aunts who became so obsessed with the red indian tales of his childhood that he went to canada disappeared into the woods and became a trapper and adopted son of an ojibway band he was a vain man with a habit of marrying and abandoning br br indian brides none of whom seem to have thought less of him for it for he was also an extraordinarily charming and picaresque character one of his wives one smarter than he by most accounts propelled him into fame as a writer and early advocate for protecting the wild country of the north and this forms the focus of attenborough's tale the chemistry between brosnan and annie galipeau as grey owl's wife pony is engaging and if not firey is nonetheless quite touching a good film when you need some time from the madding crowd,1
i really enjoyed this movie it took a pretty dark story that of shakespeare's macbeth and wrapped it in a quirky often funny and poignant modern yarn br br kudos to the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of modern nyc and macbeth's scotland together under one roof the opposing worlds act to br br really bring out the intrigue and comedy of the play and you have to love harold perrineau as the chorus a part which doesn't exist in the play but really helps to jazz things up the ending stands out among little indies i've seen for it's closure and originality,1
not totally off the wall in a good way but just totally stupid killer tongue is an uneasy mixture of sci fi horror and supposed comedy what this equates to is a mindless and totally incoherent film there is very little dialog mainly due to the fact that the script if there was one is complete pond scum i wouldn't even call it strange more like just total nonsense this movie is certain to disappoint and you have been warned there is absolutely no reason to waste time on this and if you do the pungent smell will linger like rotten fish merk,0
i loved this film because in my mind it seemed to so perfectly capture what i imagined life in french colonial africa must have been like in the 50's my generation anyway but i was truly enraptured by its quiet pacing and by the glorious ending within the last 5 minutes of this film you must focus intently on what's happening never have i been more impressed with the wrap up of a film i remember yelling wow when i realized it was over on the other hand my two daughters fell asleep on the couch,1
cage 1989 was another one of those low budget buddy action flicks that were produced during the 80's thanks in large part due to the films such as 48hrs and lethal weapon this one stars reb brown and lou ferrigno as to former vietnam vets who happen to run a local dive bar reb takes care of lou because he saved his life in 'nam but lou was shot in the head and is now pretty soft although he's huge lou has the brain of a child one day some ruffians throw their wait around in the bar and lou and rebb beat the tar out of them but payback's a mother they crash the bar leaving lou and reb with nothing that is until these two thugs come into the picture one of them's a real nice guy who have a plan in mind br br the film's a waste of time maybe if they went all they way and made a hard core action flick instead of trying to tone down the gruesomeness of the situation perhaps it could have worked alas it doesn't and the audience is left holding the bag oh well it's too bad because you have all the elements for a great b movie better luck next time i guess br br not recommended br br xxx,0
neil simon had a knack for dialog and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives walter matthau and jack lemmon as opposite types in the odd couple a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the believability of two such mismatched friends sharing an apartment br br lemmon is neatnik felix ungar bent on suicide after the divorce from his wife and reluctantly agreeing to share an apartment with oscar madison matthau with somewhat disastrous results seems that everything felix says and does drives oscar up the wall and neither one can stand the other's ways with oscar being the messiest male imaginable and felix the exact opposite br br funniest scene for me was when the giggling pigeon sisters in the apartment above visit them on a dinner date the priceless interaction between lemmon matthau and carole shelley and monica evans is enough to put you in stitches the talented pigeon sisters are the gals who did the voices for the gabble sisters a pair of geese in disney's the aristocats and here their comic timing on top of lemmon's sad story of despair is enough to spin the film into hilarity where it remains much of the time br br if you're a neil simon fan and have enjoyed other screen treatments of his work this one is not to be missed matthau and lemmon are perfectly cast even though they considered exchanging roles before filming began and of course it's easy to see why it became a top rated tv show later on br br summing up top simon comedy not to be missed,1
marvelous film again dealing with the trials and tribulations of world war 11 england what makes this film so good is the touching of the human element this film is definitely in the tradition of such british line classics such as mrs miniver and hope and glory as is the case with this film we see the desperation of people in the time of war br br the performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered john thaw who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the london bombing br br we soon see why this child wets his bed he comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terribly br br the old man takes to the child and brings happiness into his sad life when the child is returned to his mother the old man goes to london and seeks him out only to find tragedy he literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince a higher up that the child is better off with him than being in a boy's home br br the picture is so good because it deals and builds on endearing relationships,1
albuquerque is a film that has all the elements of a class a western except one the story that really belongs to a class b or c that was acceptable at the time the film was made when people were so thrilled to see a western in color but nowadays it just looks very primitive nonetheless for people who enjoy old westerns it is entertaining the original color and sound are very well kept on the dvd that recently came out gabby hayes is a good sidekick lon chaney is mean as always and randolph scott a bit more cheerful than usual in a film named albuquerque you would expect to see something that would remind you of the city but the town that is shown here could be just anywhere,1
one woman by herself in a house for 45 minutes of screen time doesn't sound like a formula to hold you on the edge of your seat but future shock is truly as thrilling as they come writer star vivian schilling takes on those little fears we all suppress and enlarges them to terrifying proportions so don't watch this film alone,1
i'm being generous giving this movie 2 stars the line about have you even seen the wizard of oz was the best part for me with terrible writing and acting like displayed in this movie it's no wonder so many are taken in by worthless tv reality shows do yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a royals baseball game your gonna be glad ya did,0
it's not just that this is a bad movie it's not only that four of the best mexican movie makers are in this film and it's not only that the script is terrible it's just that this movie sucks big time this people are wasting money in terrible scripts it's supposed to make a criticism about mexican society but we're fed up with this kind of films is bad language supposed to be funny i don't get it mexican cinema is in big trouble if this kind of movies are going to continue playing and being written and produced br br please don't think this kind of movies are well received in mexico we hate them and they don't reflect us,0
ok don't let my summary fool you this movie sucks hard but the worst movie ever this movie was terrible in ways people shouldn't have to rack their brains to describe but it is in no way worse than manos the hands of fate hobgobblins horrors of spider island or a small handful of movies as a review the movie sucks it's terrible don't see it with out mst or you may develop health problems but there are worse movies,0
this film for an after school special isn't that bad and that's the problem nothing happens you feel as if you're still in class a guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players we never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them they all of the sudden turn into good players by meditating also there are too many characters and no character development too much time is spend on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids this could have had a 'bad news bears' feel the original since there was a girl on an all boys team but there wasn't any feel to this movie at all it has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it is not fun to bag on not fun to watch and is just kind of there plain boring something you'd watch after school before your pre evening nap as dull as the day is long and it's been a long long day watching this movie,0
the movie titanic makes it much more then just a night to remember it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten why so criticised i have no idea could will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece it will be almost impossible br br the director no doubt had the major impact on the film a simple disaster film boring to watch converted to an unbelievable romance yes i'm not the romance type either but that should not bother you because you will never see a romance like this guaranteed everything to the amazing effects to the music to the sublime acting br br the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling everything looks very real and live the legend herself titanic is shown brilliantly in all classes too looks too accommodation the acting was the real effect dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles no one could have done better they are partly the reason why the film is so great br br i guess it's not too much to talk about the plot is simple the acting is brilliant based on a true story probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten well if you haven't seen this film your missing out on something hesterical and a film to idolise for hollywood could it get better no not at all the most moving film of all time don't listen to people see for yourself then you will understand a landmark don't be surprised if you cry too,1
there are very few performers today who can keep me captivated throughout an entire film just by their presence one of those few is judy davis who has built a successful career out of creating characters that are headstrong in attitude but very vulnerable at heart she takes roles that most other performers would treat melodramatically and adds a fiery deeply emotional intensity that pulls attention away from everything else on the screen br br her skills are well displayed in high tide a film that matches her up a second time with director gillian armstrong who gave davis her first major success with my brilliant career in that film davis played a young woman who was determined to make it in the world despite the suffocation she felt from her community and upbringing in high tide however davis' character lillie is roughly the opposite she gave up on any hope for her future when she was young and after giving birth to a child runs from her responsibilities and takes up a life without direction or meaning when she finally meets up with her daughter years later the thought of taking care of her child is petrifying she knows this is her chance to atone for her failures but how can she be honest with her daughter and still gain her respect br br gillian armstrong's films usually relate stories about characters who desperately want to communicate with each other but face obstacles set up by their own personal habits and addictions oscar and lucinda for instance was about a man and a woman who desperately needed each other's love but were always blindsided by their craving for chance represented by their gambling addictions here we are immersed in the world of a family torn apart by the mother's inability to commit to a settled life and her struggles to redeem herself despite being fully convinced that it's too late to change for the better this is not simply a film with a great performance at its center but also a rare achievement a fully convincing story of redemption,1
there is a reason why jay leno himself will not acknowledge this film it consistently ranks as one of the worst films of all time the acting is horrible the script lacks direction and the director himself doesn't seem sure on which way to take this film a buddy film an action comedy mystery seems half way through he gives up and is just along for the ride jay leno and pat morita are talented and dedicated performers it is a shame that they wasted their time and gifts making this mess of a movie jay leno and pat morita prior to involving themselves with this had spent years pounding out their crafts on the hollywood circuit mr morita had already been a star in his own right acting steadily since the mid 1960s as the star of such cult tv and movie classics as happy days and the dismal but affable mr t and tina and won the hearts of america with his roles in the powerful film midway the karate kid and a host of others mr leno can been seen on tv shows dating back to the mid 70s and was a top performer in the comedy clubs of america he can be seen in countless tv spots and in major films it is a shame that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense,0
one night i was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and gymkata happened to be on i watched way too much of it it is indeed hilarious and horrifying really think about it this way if in your job you had an idea for something this bad and went on to execute it in as terrible a fashion as this how long exactly would you last not as long as this movie it's a must see obviously,0
average and surprisingly tame fulci giallo which means it's still quite bad by normal standards but redeemed by its solid build up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance br br the genre's well known weaknesses are in full gear banal dialogue wooden acting illogical plot points and the finale goes on much too long while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say limp affair br br fulci's ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing though yellow clues wherever you look br br 3 out of 10 limping killers,0
simple story why say more it nails it's premise world war 3 kills all or most of the human race and we're viewing 2 of the survivors the message is that the 2 warring sides should not have been at odds in the first place distilled down to representatives from each side we see they have everything to come together for br br security finding resources food shelter etc survival love br br at the end they've decided to pool their resources she finally does so they will survive simple story expressed in the limited budget of the early 60s television landscape we see it in 2009 as somewhat old and maybe predictable in the early 60s no one had seen such stuff i give it a 10,1
i want so badly to give this piece of garbage a zero unfortunately there isn't so i had to give it a 1 just to warn you about how stupidly terrible this imposter of a familiar cartoon really is the characters look like they were drawn by pre schoolers no wait i've seen pre schoolers do better i prefer misadventures of flapjack to this terrible excuse for a cartoon i'm probably saying what others have said two words rip off remember that episode of dexter's lab when they raced go karts down that volcano yeah mister fellows even cashed in on that idea and failed they even ripped off shadow lugia in that one episode that parodied pokemon he even cashed in on that franchise that one character is a cheap rip off of mandark from dexter's lab mister fellows needs to be sued for statutory infringement for this piece of crap everyone has their own opinion but those of you who like johnny rip off test your'e just lying to yourselves do yourself a favor change the channel when this rip off tries to disgrace your screen,0
after seeing arthur on tv numerous times i laughed so hard dudley moore's role as arthur a happy go luck drunken millionaire was hysterical but john gielgud as his servant father figure hobson was equally charming i bought the dvd a few weeks ago and watched it despite the passage of nearly 27 years it's still as enjoyable as it ever was liza minnelli's role as the love interest was fascinating the chemistry between the two was magic br br arthur bach moore is a spoiled drunken millionaire who has a bar bill that reads like the national debt he has no desire to grow up and enjoys acting like a child his activities are supervised by his dry english butler hobson gielgud it appears that nobody really cares about arthur except for him arthur's father barbour offers an ultimatum if he doesn't marry the dreadful blonde socialite susan johnson eikenberry in four weeks he'll cut off his son's inheritance of 750 million dollars br br however arthur meets and falls in love with linda marolla minnelli a young working class waitress and tie thief now he faces a difficult decision marry for love or money when hobson dies arthur finally grows up and breaks it off with susan before the wedding leaving him to keep both the money and his true love br br arthur is a truly enchanting romantic comedy for for everyone,1
mmm doesn't a big stack of pancakes sound good maple syrup and fruit preserves on top take a bite mmmmmmm take another bite another another eat eat it you keep shoveling it down your throat until your face turns green with nausea you have just had the ally mcbeal experience br br i stumbled on this show in the winter of '98 and was instantly hooked like that stack of pancakes i gorged myself on it but the enjoyment soon wore off because the ally mcbeal character whom we see to be cute endearing at first sight soon becomes the most annoying insecure whining complainer you've ever met call me a feminist but i prefer my female leads to have a spine the gags gimmicks of the show also become hackneyed the music of vonda shepherd which is really shoved in your face becomes grating and the incessant character changes rewrites make the show into a damn soap opera br br my advice to you is to take this show in small doses and quit as soon as it becomes bothersome and it will i made it through 2 5 seasons before my enjoyment had totally soured it was good while it lasted but like a crazy neurotic ex girlfriend it just turned ugly after it had overstayed its welcome br br and next time you go to ihop skip the pancakes order something healthy like the fruit cup it'll sit with you much better,0
very nicely done movie it does stay in your memory better billed as a romance than flying or war altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love br br fun watching early crowe he is good and exudes charm his reading of high flight is superb br br cheers boom,1
i love science fiction i am fascinated by egyptian mythology and i appreciate digital animation i figured a movie that combines these three would be at least enjoyable i could not have been more wrong the story or actually the lack there of was completely uninspired and lacks imagination while imagination usually is the biggest component of any science fiction story the dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porno movie especially thomas kretschmann gives new meaning to the term 'bad performance' bad acting wouldn't have been such a huge problem if only 'director' bilal didn't take himself so seriously all the lines sound like they are supposed to be poetic it looks like bilal really thinks he has made a piece of art here well there's no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk only pretentiousness this man should really stick to making comics since he fails on all possible accounts as a director worst of all is the terrible digital animation which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience the graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in 'van helsing' look like live actors and since half the characters are cgi animated it is quite a problem that the cgi effects look so fake if the egyptian gods actually exist then bilal's a dead guy since they will no doubt take gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way in which he portrays them in this disastrously bad movie,0
by no means my favourite austen novel and paltrow is by no means my favourite actress but i found the film almost totally delightful paltrow does a good job and cummings stevenson and the one who plays 'miss bates' are all absolutely terrific the period detail is not alienating the feel of the movie is just right in fact but the real 'find' is jeremy northam as mr knightley there could not be more perfect casting imo i hated mr k in the novel but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film northam's good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment either highly recommended anar,1
oh my god what a horrible film the film has all the right people involved unfortunately it is not worth watching i saw it for free at my local library if i had paid to watch this i would be even more upset this film is unwatchable how could tarintino be involved with such a slow paced unexciting film no wonder it didn't get much distribution every one involved must have been ashamed i can make a better film with a dated camcorder and my big toe its beyond boring i really hated it tarintino just lost some standing in my eyes this must be some kind of sick joke don't bother with this film if some one even hints you should watch it kill them,0

wow br br i just was given this film from a friend of mine who bought it for 1 98 at walmart and he felt that he got taken it is beyond boring most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen the acting is somewhat improvised almost as if they didn't have a script the martians are cgi which look like they were done by a novice or a fan produced movie i cannot stress just how bad this dvd really is br br example in one of the scenes the martians are torturing a local female captive she goes from a woman in front of a green screen to a cgi copy of that woman the change is totally noticeable and when she is killed you can see that it is a computer figure looking like something from a game back in 1990 br br if at all possible avoid this movie like the plague you can download two trailers from their site and see how god awful it really is,0
a student filmmaker enlists a b grade actress a delectably diva ish molly ringwald to complete the horror film that her mother a dreadfully dull kylie minogue tried to make 12 years ago it's a curious plot choice to say the least as any aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors the film has a curse on it because molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set but she's back because she needs the exposure unfortunately the curse is still there and people start dying on the set cut is an aussie attempt at the modern slasher but unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table in fact it rips half of wes craven's 90s filmography lots of film world name dropping a la scream except it's aussie name dropping jane campion see how this isn't as funny and lots of is this real or is this a movie a la new nightmare the editing is bad the music is annoying the effects are laughable almost everything is bad about this fortunately the film can have a sense of humor at one point a well dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at don't worry we'll treat your house as if it were our own to which he responds that doesn't mean anything to me you look like you live in a dump ha and molly's ridiculous one liners were enough to not regret renting this one you got any diet coke in here as she rides in the film professor's car and does anyone know where i can buy any tofu the first thing she mutters on the set and where the hell is my agent oh wait that's what i was thinking for her,0
i liked timothy dalton very much even though he was a bit young and too handsome for mr r but i thought zelah clarke too plump and short this version however was very true to the novel and very well filmed i have seen 4 versions orson welles is still my favorite mr r though george c scott did very well and it's a toss up between joan fontaine and sussanah york although they were both a bit too old for the role i recently saw a brilliant tv version of rebecca with charles dance and emilia fox i would love to see those two do jane eyre by the time i got to watching the ciarin hinds version i think i was jane eyred out but i will never tire of those first few minutes of hearing joan fontaine's voice narrate the opening of the first version i ever saw i always want to go back and read the book again,1
the spoilers in this review are offered as a public service because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our protagonist the lady barbara skelton gets raped and gunned down in the end and not a moment too soon i'd have shot the screen myself but i was afraid i'd hit james mason br br the original 1943 novel called the life and death of the wicked lady skelton i guess people didn't whine about spoilers back then was written by a woman an english navy brat who was either troubled or cynical or both her heroine is devastatingly beautiful and the author seems to think that if you have beauty nothing else matters but other things do matter such as the fact that lady barbara's immediate and only response when someone gets in her way is homicide she murders three men in five attempts a serial femme fatale she's got a case of dissocial personality disorder that should have landed her in either bedlam or newgate br br lockwood plays her as a narcissistic vamp wearing so much makeup that i thought of her as a restoration era joan rivers or a restoration era joan rivers ha yet lady b is irresistible to all three principal male characters michael rennie james mason and griffith jones all of whom do good work as does patricia roc of course all three admirers realize in short order what a psychotic bitch barbara is but the plot keeps them all in her orbit until one of them finally does gun her down accidentally in what is meant to be either irony or just desserts given the dramatic death scene with a boom lifting the camera out through the windows and heavenward i presume we're meant to give a damn about her death but hers is the first corpse we don't care about,0
i recently bought this movie with a bunch of other laserdiscs from ebay usually i am into war and action movies but occasionally i enjoy romantic comedies br br if you are bored by today's special fx films and high gloss romantic comedies you should check out shop around the corner on a quiet evening what i like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency there is nothing fake or pretentious about them take mr matuschek for example when he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself not just because of the humiliation but because he has been unjust to the character of stewart ok weired example br br yes the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable yet still i liked it a lot if you likes notting hill then you will like shop around the corner in fact hugh grant reminds me a lot of jimmy stewart,1
pictures that usually glorify a hero have meaning as an example bonnie and clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds why they were two people caught up in the depression when people were desperate to survive br br this film has absolutely no substance the viggo mortensen character soon emerges as a folk hero why he speeds along an idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his stricken wife has been taking no one bothers to understand why he is trying to flee everyone even worse when the realization becomes apparent that he is not a red neck terrorist no one in government wants to help him as they try to save their rear ends br br jason priestley co stars as a radio emcee who builds upon the story in support of our hero br br the ending is absolutely unbelievable,0
i watched this over the christmas period i don't know why but it reminds me of christmas so i watched it so there we are br br arthur is a film i watch all the way through with a big dumb smile on my face and its a mixture of special performances great jolly music and a script crackling with wit and charm that causes it br br dudley moore makes a character that could well be hated very easily spoiled rich lazy drunk who feels sorry for himself but turns him into someone you love liza minelli is great as linda morolla a queens waitress who manages to pull off the tough soft on the inside lady arthur nearly gives up his world for john gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them off with relish br br i can watch arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good check it out if you need a lift its a lovely film,1
the movie had a lot of potential unfortunately it came apart because of a weak implausible story line miscasting and general lack of content substance one of the very obvious flaws was that sean connery who played an arab man didn't know how to pronounce his own arab name this may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details the quality of acting was uniformly well below average br br movie's solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end and a french song i don't recall the title overall it was a pretty bad movie where sean connery was visibly miscast,0
every christmas eve i make my kids endure yet another showing of it's a wonderful life i also thoroughly enjoyed bad santa so sue me i admit it i like cheesy schmaltzy movies i like excellent intelligent ones too but as with so many things variety is a good thing what would the christmas season be without the annual cinematic ka ching ka ching of santa in all his guises from edmund gwenn to billy bob thornton fred claus will make no one forget bedford falls but i do not believe a christmas film should have to reach iconic stature to succeed fred is a perfectly ok holiday movie with enough humor for the adults and sufficient charm for the kids my wife and i laughed a lot even if most of the humor was obvious and vince was just being vince paul giamatti was a top notch santa which helped a lot not a great flick and unlikely to become must viewing for anyone's annual christmas traditions but my wife and daughter and i enjoyed it for what it was holiday schmaltz with a small dash of spice there's nothing wrong with that,0
if alien jurassic park and countless other sci fi horror movies are your cup of tea add a lot of sugar and you'll get this one down the film begins in jolly old england around 1100ad and then jumps to present day california our hero carver dean cain is the new security chief and military advisor for a science lab 400 feet underground he arrives carver is also a helicopter pilot with the lead scientist and we soon find out it's a cloning lab and they have something newly found to clone is it a dinosaur or what as with the above movies all hell breaks loose and our characters start getting picked off the special effects on the monster are pretty good for a direct to video movie and dean cain does what he gets paid for but forget the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before again don't go in with high expectations and you'll be ok,0
this one will get reviews all over the map because it doesn't comfortably fit any mold it's horror but not a splatterfest it's equal part suspense as well as horror yet without the usual hollywood screams and jerky camera br br the feel of the movie is spare and lean with next to no special effects because i think you should listen and watch the faces of the characters br br forget that brendan is a graduate of the buffy universe that's a red herring he is acting here 'camp' is a misreading of the tone of this story adrienne barbeau is giving a rock solid performance so she must believe the script has something to say we all know the sorry excuses where the actors plainly don't care anymore and are just waiting for the director to snap cut and get their paychecks this is not the case here br br forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with almost mondo funny regularity i don't think the intent was humorous but to keep you off balance br br think of it less of a horror 'movie' and more of a horror 'play' on a stage that decrepit whitewashed house then you might see it's really about paranoia fear and spiralling madness set in an isolated someplace usa br br and it is twisty time travel mind control secret experiments and nazi's who may not be dead yet br br i say rent it and give it a try if you're in the mood for something a little cerebral this would be a good choice for a saturday midnight sit down,1
this movie deserved a working over on mystery science theater even though it has nothing whatever to do with king solomon it's worth a watch because it is an unintentional laugh riot really it's worse than destroy all monsters be sure to check out the following the cheesy medallion looks like the shriners have been here the obviously polyester norfolk jacket on allan quatermain david macallum's badly done stutter which does draw attention away from his even worse acting the incredibly bad process work on all the monsters the monsters themselves the hand puppet which menaces the little girl the giant snake that menaces macallum while he sinks in oatmeal the red lighted eyes on the motorized crabs the amazingly hilarious boat oh brother which appears to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and looks like a leftover from a jr sr prom voyage into the future with the class of '71 the phoenician city where they wear roman imperial armor but which inexplicably has egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions the phoenicians invented the alphabet come on and worst of all macallum and ekland with her fright wig playing smoochy face oh the horror the best parts are that the intrepid explorers manage to lose the comic frenchman and the african guy snuffleupagus or whatever evidently chose to die heroically rather than be in any more scenes,0
touching and sad movie portrays the trials and tribulations of a writer trying to come to terms with paralysis caused by a cycling accident the film centers on his relationship with his married lover whom he is often very hostile towards and his interactions with other accident victims particularly a black down and out and a white supremacist biker the film is often humorous often sad and always believable get out the box of kleenex and watch this on a cosy sunday afternoon with your partner,1
obviously a film that has had great influence not only on the buddy genre but action genre as well george lucas had to be a fan of this flick as so much of his star wars series seems to a homage to gunga din the characters that grant mclaglen and fairbanks play are just precursors of han solo luke skywalker and chewbacca even sam jaffe's gunga din morphed into c 3po and r2 d2 and like him or not jar jar binks br br today this film is viewed as non pc but there is a speech by eduardo ciannelli as guru the leader of the indian opposition to the british raj that could can be echoed in the sentiments of many today br br to a young boy this was a great film three strong male leads and only a hint of romance there was a time when young boys deemed kissing the girl in saturday matinee film was just mush not like today when the more skin is greeted with delight too late to lament lost innocence br br hopefully this film will not be forgotten and a few who are channel surfing will stop at tcm and catch a film with action adventure and a cast of thousands instead of cgi actors,1
indian directors have it tough they have to compete with movies like laggan where 11 henpecked castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots devdas a hapless fedar festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one's feelings or sentiments alas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry but to make a good movie you have to tight rope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with split skirts and dishum dishum fights preferably involving a nitwit bollywood leading actor who is marginally handsome so you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of leonine village head who in own words defending his village this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience there are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like nana patekar narasimhan nana patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him meanwhile his daughter is bathing his grandson this is as authentic a scene you can get in rural india nana patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in hindi films the violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with song dances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies won't sell a sad but true state of affairs faster this changes better for bollywood all said and done this is one good movie,1
it has been 16 years since it's original run i would have hoped by now some marketing wizard would have promoted a live actor version of this classic by now or at least sought to re release the original 65 episodes i can't fathom why the sci fi or cartoon network haven't snapped this up galaxy rangers actually had well thought out plots and even better scripts the animation was above average quality for it's time and excellent when compared to the talking slide show japanese animation of today it predated the heavy toon toy tie in market this may have sealed it's doom too i would willingly spend cash on a dvd of gr if available,1
magicians is a wonderful ride from start to finish thanks in large part to the magic that is generated by the stars alan arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades like any really fine film it's a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming i can't believe this film is so difficult to find i'd buy it on dvd in a heartbeat but have yet to find an outlet,1
ten out of ten stars br br it's hard to believe this was a made for television movie just the phrase made of tv makes me shudder the production values for made for tv movies are almost always remarkably lower than production values for professional movie studios that being said this version of the christmas carol should have been released in theaters because it is that good it's my personal favorite of all the christmas carol movies because every aspect of this production are of the highest quality yes there are some minor on screen glitches with two of the ghosts that visit scrooge but there isn't a movie in existence that doesn't have at least a couple of mistakes br br scott turns in a stellar performance as scrooge he's a pleasure to watch in fact i can't think of one performance in this film that shouldn't be applauded the costuming location shooting and winter backdrop are mesmerizing the musical score is endearing and heart warming add to that solid directing flawless cinematography and faithful scripting we have here what will one day be considered a holiday classic it really hasn't been around long enough to be a classic but mark my words one day soon it will be this film has turned into a yearly christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning behind christmas love selflessness and giving in as selfish greedy world my family and i can lose ourselves in the christmas carol starring george c scott,1
this u s soap opera 'knots landing' has all the entertainment value of being trapped in an elevator every episode contained plots such as rape murder kidnapping and drug smuggling not much different to the plots of other drama shows of the period as for the cast i've seen better actors on a cereal box from the mid to late '90's repeats of 'knots' stunk up u k gold like a mountain of mildewing nappies i regret to announce that i had to suffer this as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it religiously though since then re runs have been few and far between let's hope it stays that way the only positive thing that can be said of 'knots' is the catchy saxophone signature tune later used as the title music for the i t v sitcom 'the upper hand' great legacy that eh,0
although critically maligned johnny dangerously is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen it's a movie that should be watched closely some of the funny bits are done in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them for instance keep an eye on michael keaton's use of the pricing gun at the pet store and also on the documentary style years that appear at the beginning of scenes it's one of those rare movies where the humor hits you unexpectedly even though you know it's a comedy amy heckerling the director is really sharp here if you enjoyed her better known films fast times at ridgemont high clueless european vacation etc you should give this one a look br br michael keaton is extremely likable in the title role and the supporting cast griffin dunne maureen stapleton joe piscopo peter boyle is excellent highly recommended,1
rohinton mistry's multi layered novel seemed impossible to adapt for the screen but the resulting movie is filled with passion emotion humour and pathos the story is somewhat slow moving but there is always something on the screen to captivate the audience the movie perfectly catches a particular time and place with pinpoint accuracy all of the actors are indian few if any known to western audiences but they are a joy to behold especially the little girl who acts very convincingly don't be put off by the title and plot summary this is a movie to be seen on the big screen we have much to learn from it,1
cry freedom is not just a movie it is a historical account heroic story and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history not only does denzel washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating determined hero steve biko but he delivers a message to the public about the horrors of south arfrican apartheid the story of biko an influential leader and his main influencee donald woods is a heartbreaking one but the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in south africa cry freedom manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot it is because of great films like this one that the public can become educated on terrible events in history great leaders who sought to end them and how we can never allow them to happen in the future because of this importance cry freedom is an amazing film that should be seen by all,1
the subject notwithstanding this is an amateur exhibitionist movie or an effort at one which is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school student's composition book full of death poetry to be sure it will disturb viewers who are hell bent on being disturbed but the success will be attributable to themselves not to the director to genuinely get under somebody's skin requires sensibility discipline technique and talent as well as an eye and an ear the film does contain one evocative image shown as a still and also used on the video case but with no development leading up to or away from it if the director had had an eye he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie that is a movie,0
when i saw the elaborate dvd box for this and the dreadful red queen figurine i felt certain i was in for a big disappointment but surprise surprise i loved it convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles let alone take in the ridiculous explanation these quibbles apart however the film is a dream fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful bruno nicolai score he may not be morricone but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so really enjoyable with lots of colour plenty of sexiness some gory kills and minimal police interference super,1
i enjoyed this movie so much that i watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary the musical score cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an imax production even though it is shot for those huge imax theaters it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system in fact this would make a perfect dvd to demo your system br br the subject is also so fascinating it is about mario andretti and his son michael i was already a fan of mario because he is the best racecar drive in history since he is the only person to win the cart championship f1 championship the daytona 500 and the indianapolis 500 the script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son the first car is found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster that mario ever drove and we follow restoration to gleaming perfection the other car is michael's new racecar and we follow it from cutting the mold through the race season imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating br br paul newman who was michael amoretti's team owner at the time this movie was made narrates the film his anecdotes and witticism drawn from many years as an owner and driver lends much to the production br br the main feature is the race scenes turn up the volume here there is something about riding along at over 200 mph and the musical score that totally draws you into the screen for an experience you will not forget wow br br the final magical element is the humanity of the andretti family this god of the racing world mario andretti is loving father who proudly watches over his son's career they work together so well that every father and son should see this you can tell that they are a close family i wish we could all have that experience,1
and possibly closest to the dickens story line although i find the young ebenezer hard to watch who's idea was that period hair surely they could have done better than that scott does an incredible job as scrooge his delivery of some of the lines from dickens finally brought it to life for me edward woodward is everything we expect and more of the ghost of christmas present i find g c scott's scrooge much more of a believable miser than the more current version done by patrick stewart the scene christmas morning when scrooge realizes he hasn't 'missed it' is enough to convince one that scott knows how to act versus overact he's phenomenal here nearly the entire cast is incredible the tiny tim in this version of the christmas carol is a little tough to look at almost too sweet still the music and the scenery make this a must watch every holiday enjoy,1
this was obviously the prototype for mick dundee but 'the adventures of barry mckenzie is funnier i was amused throughout and laughed out loud plenty of times terrific central performance by barry crocker in the title role an australian who invades england to upset the poms with his free flowing uncouth ways few brits will be upset by barry's frequently cruel observations on his hosts the relationsip between the two countries is prickly but friendly and this is highlighted by the film's final line delivered by a somewhat reluctant mckenzie as he boards the plane home i was just starting to like the poms,1
the dehumanising effect of war is a much studied subject in the movies as is the equally dehumanising but potentially life saving dehumanising effect of military training joel schumacher's 'tigerland' follows the standard template we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained typically as here vietnam but 'tigerland' has an interesting take by centring its account on a cocky dissident named bozz played outstandingly well by colin farrell who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity around this character a taught gripping plot has been constructed and it's also a plus that the action never leaves america whereas stanley kubrick's 'full metal jacket' to name just one other film of a similar type lost focus once the action shifted to asia although this is not a film of staggering originality it's supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout the best film from this director that i've seen and among the very best of its genre,1
whoever made this nonsense completely missed the point jane is a silly comic strip to titillate without being sleazy br br this giant mess tries to be funny and exciting but is just a shambles there is not one decent performance in it even the usually reliable jasper carrott is painfully unfunny br br the american bloke whose name escapes me is just as rubbiush as he was in flash gordon br br maud adams tries as a villianess but she is a bit long in the tooth for this type of thing all of these things would not matter if the girl was sexy or funny or likable she is not kirsten holmes faded into obscurity after this and so much the better br br i've flushed more entertaining things than this down the toilet avoid,0
one wonders how the script came to be written br br wayne and the other performers do an ok job but as it is neither comedy romantic thriller or anything else it is all rather disappointing br br one feels as if one of the threads had been pursued it could have been something worthwhile it is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the usa became directly involved with the war i wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes but ending up with something that pleases no one br br nonetheless it has historical value,0
as i've noticed with a lot of imdb comments certain reviewers seem to demand that every film they see have smugly intelligent plots that wallow in there own cleverness i am not one of those people if i watch an action film i want to see explosions gunfire and heroics if i watch a comedy i want to have tears of laughter in my eyes you get the idea therefore watching a horror film i primarily want to be scared the grudge is a very scary film in both it's well executed 'jump' scenes and it's creepy imagery i've been a horror film fan for many years and i'm talking about the masters such as dario argento rather than directors of some of the treadmill teen horror flicks that are churned out these days if you want to be scared watch this film way scarier than the original japanese 'ring' which i also think is a great film,1
i noticed fire was on cable the other night and i began watching it because i couldn't recall anything specific about it other than i remember it being a horrible film when i saw it back in '85 twenty years later the film is still awful besides the synthesizer the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the 1980s as is evident in the title song hearing that song again made me want to jab a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted upon them and to compound this musical assault rob lowe's character played saxophone and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was charlie parker only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo all the characters were intensely unappealing although i must say they did a great job of casting equally unappealing actors to portray them actually i thought mare winningham was appealing and i initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear but then near the end of the movie she decides to have sex with rob lowe's character who would probably be voted most likely to transfer a variety of sexual diseases if such thing were voted upon,0
don't mistake war inc for a sharply chiseled satire or a brainy comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs it isn't br br this is an old fashioned screwball comedy with ridiculously coincidental plot twists stock characters given some depth in fun performances by john cusack joan cusack marisa tomei and hillary duff and a straightforward approach to the political content br br you see the filmmakers' political points are things nearly all of the country already knows are true yeah we understand that the corporations profiting off the war are corrupt inept pigs the political leaders in charge of it are even more inept buffoons and american imperialism has never looked crasser and more out of touch than it does right now but none of that is the point br br here all of that noise is the setting that they lampoon sometimes in genius ways as the backdrop for a silly romp as john cusack's character the hit man with a heart tries to change his life with the help of the do gooder journalist who doesn't trust him tomei and the young middle eastern starlet who wants to call off her marriage duff cusack's sister joan plays his assistant with an almost cartoonishly enthusiastic quality ben kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless cia boss br br that's all and it works it's simple fun but if somehow you can't see reality and you think the war is going well and everyone involved with it is doing a good job and there's no corruption and people in the middle east wish our western culture would supplant theirs then you might not find it as funny br br for all the rest of us it was a light comedy with a political edge,1
sure this one isn't really a blockbuster nor does it target such a position dieter is the first name of a quite popular german musician who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and thats exactly what this movie is about it is based on the autobiography dieter bohlen wrote a few years ago but isn't meant to be accurate on that the movie is filled with some sexual offensive content at least for american standard which is either amusing not for the other actors of course or dumb it depends on your individual kind of humor or on you being a bohlen fan or not technically speaking there isn't much to criticize speaking of me i find this movie to be an ok movie,0
i loved the first two movies but this movie was just a waste of time and money for me and the studio i'm still wondering why they made this horrible movie the thing with the plastic gun and with the toy car that can go into another house are ridiculous joe pesci and daniel stern in the first two movies were so funny but the terrorists in this one are so stupid and not funny believe me this movie is just a waste of time,0
ok so the fx are not high budget but this story is based on actual events not something thrown together to make a couple of rich actors even richer as most movies that are based on books there are somethings that just don't fit only a couple of people have stated that this movie was based on real events not a knock off as most people believe it is this movie is in no way related too twister other than both movies are about tornadoes br br for those of you who have problems with the science of the tornadoes and storms in the movie there are a couple of things you need to remember the actual night of the twisters was june 3 1980 so this movie was released 16 years after the actual events try think how far storm research has advanced in that time it happened in a larger town grand island nebraska is the third largest city in the state even though the movie calls the town something else and says it's a small town for the real story check out http www gitwisters com,1

intelligent stylish and compelling thriller from the great brian de palma is a modern classic that firmly ranks among his best films br br when troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger the victim's son joins with a prostitute to uncover the killer br br dressed to kill left a strong impression upon the audiences of its day and for good reason de palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setup and builds into a harrowing mystery full of strong suspense the finale and conclusion are especially 'nightmarish' it's a truly edge of your seat shocker even more impressive though is de palma's elegant direction that gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own dressed to kill is also a very erotic film but mainly in a strangely beautiful way pino donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film br br the cast is another strong feature of this film michael cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist angie dickenson is wonderful as the ill fated housewife nancy allen's performance as an involved street walker is solid a young keith gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter as the investigating son br br many criticize de palma's films for having hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception but any similarities between hitchcocks works and de palmas can only be seen as a good quality as calling this film a 'rip off' would be degrading to a fine thriller dressed to kill is a must see for all cinema fans br br out of,1
i opted to see the film at the recent dubai film festival because it had been selected to the cannes film festival's prestigious competition section i was surprised that cannes could be so off the mark in judging quality br br the film some reviewers have noted does not have too much of gunfire but the inherent violence is repulsive imagine killing your enemy competitor in front of your young son or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty there are some hints of the contrasting corleone sons in copolla's godfather that seem to resurface here in this chinese hong kong film but the quality of the two are as distinctly different as chalk and cheese br br this film is only recommended for violence junkies there is no great cinema here at best it might be considered to be better than the usual run run shaw production for production values,0
watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood memories i'm 34 now have not seen it since i was 12 14 i had almost forgotten about this movie but when i watched it again recently some scenes literally brought a tear to my eye that little robot jinx friends for ever it was just like revisiting my childhood it was an absolutely amazing experience for me i will always cherish this movie for that reason i hope some of you readers can relate to my experience not for this particular movie but any movie you have not seen in a long while very nostalgic br br thanks for reading,1

possible spoiler adam sandler is usually typecast in comedy but in reign gives a deeply moving performance while there are people who showed courage facing post september 11 2001 sandler plays fineman a widower who is lonely and lost in his own world johnson cheadle a practicing dentist encounters his old college buddy sandler and wants to catch up on old times we see as in rain man dustin hoffman fineman also gets emotional and withdrawn in stressful situations oldies music appears to be a comfort and psychological crutch for him to lean on br br johnson looks for in fineman that certain pleasure and ease missing in his family he also feels unhappy and unsatisfied in his job in the same instance he also wants to make sure his friend does not fall through the social cracks i came away from this movie with a different outlook and more sympathetic compassion for grieving families,1

this movie has taken a lot of stick it was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking nicolas cage's career the thing i don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic oscar contender of a movie it's just some brilliant bruck buster action at its best fast cars quick editing and a great soundtrack it does exactly what it says on the tin also for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat it has everything ferraris mercs a hummer and lets not forget eleanor i think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie and personally a better movie at all then again maybe that's just me,1
seriously the fact that this show is so popular just boggles the mind this show isn't funny it isn't clever it isn't original it's just a steaming pile of bull crap let me start with the characters the characters are all one dimensional morons with loud exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard the voice acting could've been better then there's the animation my god it hurts my eyes just looking at it everything is too flat too pointy too bright and too candy coated then there's the humor or lack thereof it's completely idiotic they just take these b grade jokes that aren't even that funny in the first place and then repeat them to death they also throw in some pointless potty humor which sickens me and finally last and least the music it's just plain annoying it sounds like it was composed on a child's computer and generates no emotion whatsoever i wish there was a score lower than 1 i really do this show seriously needs to be canceled it's a show i try to avoid like the plague whenever i hear the theme song i immediately turn the tv off if you've never watched this show then don't watch quality programming like the simpsons or futurama,0
fate stay night is an animated series inspired by a h game somehow the producers turned it around making this a successful series without any of the h stuff it couldn't have been any other way because the development of the characters is great just the way it's pictured in this series and any alteration of that could only ruin perfection you'll understand once you see all the episodes br br despite a relatively slow start the producer took his time on presenting the characters things gain momentum quickly and soon after mid series the action gets so intense that glues you to your seat br br the topic of the series concentrates on the war of holy grail that has been taking place in the fukuky city for the last 50 years the pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and enveloped a large portion of the city he unwillingly witnesses a fight between two servants that triggers his reiju holy mark to summon one of the most powerful servants of the battlefield saber his first contact with saber left him stunned such immeasurable beauty i was at a lost for words br br you mustn't compare this series with any other to fully understand it's plot fsn offers much more than some cool sword fights good animation spectacular lights great soundtrack it offers excellent character and relationship development it presents the changes that take place within the characters personalities as the events precipitate the action reveals believable dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of the individuals not similar to the linear type other series use that are constantly shaping their personalities to reveal from under the mask of perfection flawed characters br br the saber character is tied to a medieval legend that has been altered to fit this series and should be accepted as such you shouldn't watch fsn thinking that it doesn't present the viewer with the historic fact just remember that this is adventure fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can the ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes i would have watched them in the same breath,1

the luzhin defence is in the foreground a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant turturro who becomes consumed by the game and in the background via flashbacks his boyhood life and the forces which created the man he has become factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest watson and former mentor wilson respectively and you have a plaintive drama laced with poignant and delicately humorous moments mingled with the rich scenic beauty of italy's lake como and the intensity of high chess play an excellent film for those into period dramas the auteur's euphemistic chess play metaphor for orgasmic delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film,1
today i wrote this review in anger at uwe boll and hollywood br br hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation 911 changed everything it changed our perception of security it changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity most importantly and devastatingly it changed our world br br however i can't not stress how utterly repulsed disillusioned and angry i am at the careless blatant ignorance of hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction this film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word of mouth among moviegoers and critics alike most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press hollywood has sunk to a new low even lower than the low down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty behind it all is uwe boll i am very angry at this movie how dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost how dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy how dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post 911 world how dare they br br to those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty i say this with a heavy heart with all my strength remember think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person think back to that day ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks br br ask yourself if you have a soul br br think remember respect the memories of the lives lost on 911 by not seeing this film at all,0
i thoroughly enjoyed this film for its humor and pathos i especially like the way the characters welcomed gina's various suitors with friends and family like these anyone would feel nurtured and loved i found the writing witty and natural and the actors made the material come alive,1
this has an interesting albeit somewhat fanciful sci fi plot but it's wasted with poor direction and shlocky special effects rae dawn chong is appealing despite the lack of a believable story and direction consistent with her talent,0
i don't know who could find fault with a simply human and funny film like this with lots of delights for your heart i enjoyed each minute of it and guessed the ending half way through the movie but that did not disappoint me at all it will not only touch your heart but it's such a good family friendly film we need many more like these,1
it is not an easy film to watch it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character that it is in my humble opinion one of the very greatest films of all time br br the film is depressing cynical and cruel if you want something uplifting see jacques rivette's fantastic céline and julie go boating which was made around the same time it shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to change br br it involves a supposedly liberated ménage à trois between alexandre played by jean pierre leaud marie bernadette lafont and veronika francoise lebrun yet alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man the women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gaze br br the film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary french new wave this movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it jean pierre leaud was one of the key actors of the new wave having starred among other films in the influential les quatres cent coups 1959 by francois truffaut as a rebellious teenager director jean eustache is not as well known as other directors from the new wave but he should be br br there is no improvisation unlike in john cassavetes's similar films made in the us and the dialogue comes from real life conversations the film is resonant with eustache's personal experiences for example francoise lebrun was a former lover of eustache eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real life person that the character marie was based on did too the anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by veronika delivered directly to the audience breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film this mesmerising personal and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around,1
dark wolf quick review let's get right to it this is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sh t on it it's just an awful movie it's an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an 80's high school drama film what's worse is that poor kane hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf kane f cking hodder someone's trying to ensure that playing jason voorhees is the height of his film career br br anyway former playmate jaime bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf too it's kind of a crappy cop drama with the world's worst looking werewolf in it but it does have moments of near rampant nudity but that's about all want to know more okay the werewolf is generally an ugly looking black blur zipping around the screen and when we're privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence we're presented with something that resembles a full motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the playstation the first playstation the cg animation is really that primitive only good for horror hardcore fanatics that want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit 2 10 br br www residenthazard com,0
this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed while late 1944 and into 1945 would reveal just how evil and horrific they were this film unlike other hollywood films to date is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocities br br the film begins in a courtroom in the future after the war is over the film was made in 1944 the war ended in may 1945 in this fictitious world court a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimm's life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks at first it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis however after a while it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama br br all in all the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second tier actors there are many compelling scenes and performances especially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that can't help but bring you close to tears it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first overall it's a must see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film br br fyi this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film but hitler was referred to as that paper hanger this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper this is in fact not true previously he'd been a starving artist homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi a horrible person yes but never a paper hanger,1
okay i struggled to set aside the fact that in selling evp as real the movie was basically lying to me from the get go i reasoned that hell i don't believe in vampires but i still liked dracula so i could live with this br br however even with that accepted the movie is just not very good it's competently made and acted but it doesn't really capture you at all there are several jump moments and i just looked at them and thought yeah i didn't expect that without actually jumping in the slightest br br also the resolution doesn't make sense if the force behind this is capable of doing the things it seems to be then why the hell does it need to use a proxy plus the end caption was absurd they obviously put it there as part of the give the movie credibility by claiming it's all real thing but for that to work it really needs to be at the start but they can't put it at the start because then they give the plot away sticking it in at the end just made it stick out like a sore thumb,0
i heard many stories about this film being great well i took my chance when i saw it for a cheap price at ebay last month br br i watched it and i have only a few comments about it br br 1 terrible story line 2 terrible acting 3 bad fighting scenes br br i never seen any worse movie in my life so far when the storyline is bad than at least make the fights something more interesting but both are done ridiculously bad br br the only positive thing about this movie in my opinion is nikki berwick god she looks nice in this movie br br that's about it,0
i went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession i just wanted to check it out i was not expecting much of anything after all a musician an actor and a screenplay writer not possible for so much talent to reside in one person right br br wrong obsession aside it quickly became one of my favorites the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects the story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along as the credits roll by you suddenly realize you were glued until the end br br at times the acting seems a little over the top i do however believe it's done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character otherwise i wouldn't have expected the level of acting witnessed br br it's worth seeing more than once i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something i either missed or forgot about the first time or two around br br i completely recommend this movie feel free to go in with your doubts but i'm sure it will find a place on your shelf,1
as part of the celebration of the release of casino royale this film with the new bond starring in it was shown from director roger michell notting hill i almost turned it off for being a bit boring but i'm glad i stuck with it basically may anne reid is a single mother of helen anna wilson jones who hardly sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend in years her daughter says that she might want to get married to her new boyfriend darren daniel craig of course after knowing each other only a few days may and darren have a secret affair and at her age with a 30 something and the new bond anyway they obviously want to keep it a secret but may has regrets and wonders if helen will find out when she does darren gets less hassle than may in fact helen asks her permission to hit her also starring peter vaughan as toots danira govich as au pair harry michell as harry rosie michell as rosie and johnny english's oliver ford davies as bruce very good,1
this really is a great movie some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by fred and ginger is among their best ever but basically all of fred and ginger's movies are the same after the singing and dancing is over it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work what really bothers me is why all the negative comments about randolph scott his romance with harriet hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why i watch this over and over again he adds to this movie he doesn't detract from it he has a winning personality and a great smile randy is in my top ten all time favorites list it's great to see him as something other than a cowboy ok so he isn't really a great actor but like so many other stars errol flynn alan ladd victor mature etc he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions all of fred and ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour i just wish more people would appreciate randy and i felt a need to stand up for him,1
i saw this movie in 1976 my first year of living in new york i went on to live there for the next 26 years but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small tv movie it was part of a pbs series as i recall and i've never forgotten it br br there are no sex scenes to speak of just delicate moving extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement all set within a conservative boston i think world war 1 environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war and did not seek out a career and financial independence frances lee mccain is superb in the role of career photographer and i have spent the next 30 odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail br br there has to be a video of this movie sure it should be on dvd but surely at least a video,1
having low expectations going in the opening new footage clocked at over five minutes of 'husbands' came as a pleasant surprise i won't say the new footage was grade a material but it provided a very solid foundation for what could have been a good all original film br br unfortunately this was put together in 1955 during a time of one day shooting schedules after the new footage jules white decided to just thumbtack stock footage from 'brideless groom' into this short making for a not so smooth story transition which jules and felix adler try to remedy with a quickie bit of new footage at the end giving us the old worn out ending of the boys moe larry in this case getting shot in the butt br br 3 10,0
first up this film according to the slick said it won best film at worldfest film festival in houston texas hmmm must have been a quiet year br br wouldn't call this the worst film ever but it certainly sucks is pretty much just as terrible as other aussie b grader body melt but at least that film didn't look like it was shot on hi 8 video br br my guess is the film makers watched a lot of troma films and really bad b grade gore films thinking that they too could crack into the business releasing this film br br don't get me wrong i love really low grade films just the fact that some of the characters put on fake american accents almost as if doing so would give them more chance to sell it in the states or something really disappointing ending as well the showdown could have been way more exciting and some good fight scenes you can completely see that the film makers are trying to copy bad taste with the whole car explosion rocket launcher and endless amount of people being gunned down yet the finale lacks any over the top humour or style like bad taste br br if you like watching really bad gore films or are interested in no budget film making watch it otherwise stay away,0
for a long time i haven't seen so beautiful animated feature having healthy respect for pixar i must say that ratatouille or any other movie made by 'em can not be compared to this animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here the graphics is amazing the background surroundings are mind blowing almost every object in every frame is drawn perfectly sometimes i felt tingles down my spine so much i loved what i've seen br br the plot is absolutely romantic as romantic as the animated film plot can possibly be the characters are lovable especially hector the blue rabbit he owns pawns rocks and rules the other char s are very nice also the humor is top notch br br generally it seemed that creators didn't invest much effort into this i mean it looked like it didn't take em too much in difference from people of pixar dreamworks who try hard every time to think on something new and i'm very glad that a product of european animation studio turned out to be so great they've made a magnificent touching movie a candy for eye and heart br br the only minus is stupid beginning and that's why it's 9of10 not 10 10,1
a masterpiece br br thus it is possibly not for everyone br br the camera work acting directing and everything else is unique original superb in every way and very different from the trash we are sadly used to getting br br summer phoenix creates a deep believable and intriguing esther kahn as everything else in this film her acting is unique it is completely her own neither british nor american nor anything else i have ever seen there is something mesmerizing about it br br the lengthy unbroken natural shots are wonderful reminding us that we have become too accustomed to a few restricted ways of shooting and editing,1
leonard maltin must've been watching some other movie though i find his guide to be quite a valuable resource please disregard his comments on this one he states starts off well then fizzles when it's really the reverse starts off tepid then catches fire the plot is about as simple as it gets happy mom happy dad and happy son take a vacation at an isolated beach dad incapacitated in accident mom runs off to get help meets up with dangerous escaped convict mom tries to trick convict into helping while dad waits and hangs on for dear life br br good white knuckler given an electric jolt by ralph meeker appearing suddenly the director john sturges films it in a clever way that will make you gasp around halfway through as the cunning desperate criminal meeker is an unusually flippant reckless actor at least here and in the classic kiss me deadly and he happily snatches the keys to the film's narrative and speeds off with the top down his character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying pretty neat huh when he's especially pleased with his misdeeds there is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage barbara stanwyck don't go away she fires back where would i go they're in the middle of nowhere and he realizes sitcom ishly yeah that's right the friction between them is a hoot br br there are flaws somewhat ridiculous ones there's one scene where the police who have been chasing after meeker for some time stop stanwyck's car and to evade detection meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would and pretends to be asleep as she's being questioned a he looks conspicuously un masculine in this pose and b i think it's safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse suspicion br br still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusion br br,1
after finally watching walt disney's song of the south on myspace i decided to watch ralph bakshi's response to that movie coonskin on afro video which i linked from google video in this one during the live action sequences preacherman charles gordone takes his friend sampson barry white with him to pick up pappy scatman crothers and randy philip thomas years before he added michael for his middle name professionally as the latter two escape from prison during their attempt pappy tells randy a tale of brother rabbit voice of thomas brother bear white and preacher fox gordone and their adventures in harlem as expected in many of these bakshi efforts there's a mix of animation and live action that provides a unique point of view from the writer director that is sure to offend some people another fascinating animated character is miss america who's a big as in gigantic in every way white blonde woman dressed in skin tight red white and blue stars and stripes who has a hold on a little black man and has him shot in one of the most sexually violent ways that was shockingly funny to me there are plenty of such scenes sprinkled throughout the picture of which another one concerning brother bear's frontal anatomy also provided big laughs from me there's also a segment of a woman telling her baby of a cockroach she was friends with who left her that was touching with that part seeming to be a tribute to the comic strip artist george herriman i was also fascinated hearing grover washington jr 's version of ain't no sunshine heard as part of the score most compelling part of the picture was seeing the scatman himself depicted with his head in silhouette during the opening credit sequence singing and scatting to a song that has him using the n word in a satirical way when i saw a vhs cover of this movie years ago it had depicted brother rabbit in insolent mode in front of what looked like the warner circles with the slogan this movie will offend everybody that is ample warning to anyone who thinks all cartoons are meant for children that said i definitely recommend coonskin to fans of bakshi and of every form of animation,1
if you think weird al yankovic is hilarious you won't be disappointed by the compleat al not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of yankovic's more memorable videos like a surgeon and i love rocky road among them but they are inter spliced with funny vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist's rise to fame yankovic is not for all tastes but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non fans will at least be lightly amused die hard fans will love it not only for its content but also for its relatively early look into yankovic's now nearly three decade career suitable for all ages kiddies will no doubt love the funny visuals,1

i remember watching this movie when i was young but could not recall the title to it then going through horror movies i find it and think to myself that is the title this movie is a kind of combination disaster film insect attack film with fewer notable stars in it it is also somewhat boring too as it has that television vibe to it where you can see the movie fade out for commercials and such the plot has this sort of resort being invaded by ants i think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby but do not quote me on that the most memorable ant attack for me in the whole flick was the first one involving the kid who falls into the swimming pool after being swarmed and of course summers attack scene too what else stands out in this one is the very goofy ending where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breath through in the end though like most television movies this movie is very tame and not very scary in the least unless you panic at the sight of ants,0
having not seen the films before and not being able to stand matt damon i was reluctant to go see the bourne ultimatum when we were asked to see it for as film studies br br however i was pleasantly surprised that even a film with damon in it could be enjoyable br br fast fight scenes crazy motorbike chases and big explosions were what threw you out of your seat in tbu the near misses between the cia and bourne kept you on your toes and throughly entertained br br nevertheless several things really grated my cheese br br firstly the fact that the film was just a series of bourne cia bourne cia bourne cia this sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull although damon did keep us entertained and seemed always one step ahead of the cia i was getting a bit annoyed with the constant survival of bourne he crashed a car and got out as if he had tapped it or something very unrealistic br br and secondly inevitably the shaky camera it was so shaky it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class even the tutors seasick we were told by the tutors that if we ever used that in a film we made in class it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod fair enough if greengrass wanted it to look like we were there watching damon and stiles holding a conversation but surely we wouldn't be shaking our heads that violently br br but all in all tbu is an enjoyable film and worth a watch but i didn't think it was the best film of the year despite being an entertaining piece of cinema br br 8 10,1

first of all sorry for giving even a rating of 1 to this movie nothing less than this available the film fails in every department be it screenplay direction characterization or acting br br 1 to start with the name of the movie is really c class though the movie itself match up to the name 2 amitabh bachchan tries his best to live up to the character but the weak script coupled with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character 3 in sholay gabbar singh has reward of 50 000 on him which was convincing here in aag the figure was 100 crores for babban amitabh bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so called hero's and had only few men bikes to commute with all automatic guns making a sholay like movie in mumbai type setup in modern time doesn't look convincing 4 as for nisha kothari somebody needs to tell her that she doesn't know acting why is ram gopal verma casting her again and again 5 mohanlal was good but there is hardly anything for him to do 6 sushant singh and rajpal yadav who are great actors are wasted in the movie 7 legendry role played by lila misra mausi of basanti in sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some gangu mummy ramu please grow up and understand that there needs to be some intellect in your movie enough of stupid characters in your movie like shiva and aag 8 should not say anything about modern jai and veeru pathetic to the greatest extent br br to summarize i was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of original classic please don't waste money and time on this movie i think watching aap ka surror which i thought was the worst movie possible would be a better idea than to see this horrible package of stupid characters bad songs and miserable direction br br thanks saurabh,0
i think that new york is a big fake i mean her whole guidelines of this show is stupid i enjoyed flavor fl av more better she acts like a slut and a hoe put together her mother is out of this world i think she is the devils daughter i mean what does she think she is doing these men already have girls and i believe once you have been with her you will be to ashamed to go back to your girl she is nasty spoiled and a big fat fake the show is very interesting to watch how much money is she getting to do this awful show and whats up with her mother i thought her and new york did not get along but now it seems as though she is just as fake as her crazy daughter and where is the so called husband he is no where to be found i would not to be with them either,0
it's a poor film but i must give it to the lead actress in this one francine forbes she appeared to be acting the least and i personally thought she was kind of cute too bad she only appears in one other film in the database besides that the film is filled with laughable gore and fakey death scenes people get stabbed and they gush like 2 gallons of blood but if you like to watch poor horror films i recommend this one highly,0
you know what kind of movie you're getting into when the serial killer main character is being transported to the electric chair in what seems to be a bakery truck only to have the prison vehicle collide with and i'm not making this up a genetic engineering tanker truck the goo which spurts forth melts him and fuses his dna with the snow creating our protagonist the killer snowman br br my favorite portion of the movie however is an over the shoulder shot of the snowman thrashing some poor schmuck in which his hands look suspiciously like a couple of white oven potholder gloves br br mmmmm schlock,0
but the actress playing the daughter just doesn't come across as credible br br it doesn't work for me when i see an actress of about 25 years playing the role of a 12 year old other commentators have suggested that this is one of the messages of this film that children may sometimes seem more adult like than adults but with the casting as it is in this film it just doesn't work for me br br you might want to check other comments to find out what this film is actually about because i couldn't bear watching it to the end br br i agree that the premise for this film is beautiful though i wish another director would try to pick up this story again,0
i am very tolerant of really bad sci fi and horror movies i've been watching them since i was 4 or 5 so i've seen some really bad stuff but i deal with it i've even watched a lot of scifi channel movies so i know not to expect much a usually promising movie that has no ending to speak of hope springs eternal i guess or the triumph of hope over experience as they say unfortunately this is a dog right from the beginning and i knew it but like a moth to the flame i kept thinking something anything interesting would happen it doesn't all of the actors give a decent performance given the script i don't know how they all kept straight faces it has something to do with collagen starved worm parasite creatures who are slowly taking over the human race one body at a time there's an evil plastic surgeon who collaborates with the enemy by giving them the outward appearance of humans don't worry he gets what's coming to him the slug people themselves don't really know where they came from they think they might have thumbed a ride on a meteor that landed on earth but somehow they know about the members of slug royalty among them the slug princess has managed to breed with a human being who knows that she's the worm queen and loves her for her self oh must i go on please i implore you do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this anything would be better think of the worst least enjoyable way you can spend two hours it would be better than this,0
i actually had hopes for this movie since i've seen kari in a few other things and think she has some talent alas this dud is a case study in what not to do in a screenplay completely undefined characters without a shred of likeability and no plot whatsoever is it a road buddy comedy thriller romance drama the filmmakers don't have a clue and neither do we,0
eytan fox whilst generally leaning on the apologist side of israeli politics has made several quite interesting films in the past such as walk on water and the simply wonderful film yossi jagger in the bubble however he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme br br far from giving this film a standing ovation the people at the screening i attended quietly got up and left i also quietly left fuming with anger at such a ridiculously one sided film that translates self preservation as racist bullying and racist bullying and terrorism as outbursts of justified anger which implies that arabs are so wronged by the evil israelis that they react in anger to a constant stream of one sided israeli aggression against them and that they therefore should not be held responsible for their actions br br this film wasn't worth the money i paid for the ticket indeed i considered demanding my money back and was basically an israeli apeing of the palestinian film paradise now if you want to be an anti israeli then by all means watch this film as it really justifies just such a belief system the fact that this film was made by an israeli director and even worse such a talented israeli director is a crying shame indeed just how israel can be surprised to be regarded as a pariah state when israelis themselves make such anti israel propaganda beggars belief br br what a shameful horrid little film,0
we all know that countless duds have graced the 80s slasher genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust maybe that's a bit hastey but damn if slaughter high wasn't terribly unoriginal even for a slasher flick pretty much the plot involves a kid who experienced a carrie like shower humiliation in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek out revenge on a group of former bullies who all show up to reminisce as you'd expect they are killed off steadily by a masked madman on april 1st by means of electrocution burning hanging and chemically altered beer i've got a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie but considering the ending i feel the need to discard my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time ignore any thought of viewing this movie,0
rich in love is a slice of life film which takes the viewer into the goings on of a somewhat quirky charleston sc family highly romanticized beautifully shot well written and acted ril washes over you like a summer breeze as its plotless meandering breathes life into the characters such that at film's end you'll feel like an old friend of the family br br a wonderfully crafted character driven film from the director of driving miss daisy ril is a somewhat obscure little sleeper which will appeal most to mature audiences,1
i don't know maybe it's just because it's an impressive tribute to some muslim religious action hajj but i just felt the movie is so underrated i just can't believe that the movie has just been voted by only 223 people so far given that the movie was produced in 2004 and it has won many awards since then about the movie it's one of those well acted sweet movies reda a french teenager due to sit for baccalauréat is asked by his devout elderly father to take him to mecca strange as it may seem if one doesn't know much about islam the father wants his son to drive them from their home in france to saudia arabia on a once in a lifetime religious pilgrimage the generation gap between the father and the son is based on simple enough terms 'you may know how to read and write but you know nothing about life ' the unnamed father to his son but some sort of bromidic generation gap literature is avoided bot of them are affectionate in their frustrations the father never speaks in french though reda understands arabic but can only seem to answer in french though they encounter many people on the road there's the scary old woman they pick up in the bosnian border on the way to belgrade and the talkative mustafa jacky nercessian who helps them out at the border of turkey the reticent and shy women wearing burqas on the way to damascus the focus is always on the mismatched father and son there is not much of a conversation in the movie which makes it enjoyable to your eyes you see magnificent views in every city they go the director shows you even the blue mosque and the hagia sophia even though the movie is not relatively long br br generally i don't like movies which don't have enough dialogs and which take their power from camera subtleties but this one was really great despite some unanswered details like reda's unseen french girlfriend the movie appeals to senses great work of art and remember this movie is ismaël ferroukhi's debut,1
a lot of people are saying that al pacino over acted but i mean common obviously for a movie role like this a cuban drug lord you need a bit of over acting in this role with that cuban accent this movie overall was a really good movie i myself rated a 10 10 i would highly recommend people to watch this movie,1
i watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of sophia loren i'm a person who they call a cultural barbarian i hate art in any kind of shape or form rambo is more my kind of movie action kills blood horror if you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague no one dies no action no nudity nothing of the kind let me give you a résumé in a few sentences it starts out with 5 minutes in black and white nazi propaganda every italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of hitler except for a housewife an anti fascist and a caretaker the housewife who is cheated by her husband meets the anti fascist she falls in love with him wants to make love to him but the anti fascist is gay despite of this they make love with each other at the end of the day the housewife reads a book from her gay lover and the guy himself is deported by agents the end you want an even shorter résumé boring that short enough the guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself to save the audience from this atrocity on a side note my sister loved this movie like i said i'm a cultural barbarian,0
skippy from family ties goes from clean cut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy movie the film seems like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed metal music was turning their kids evil or making them kill themselves except in this one a dead satanic metal star is trying to come back from the grave using skippy to help out and while the plot is corny and cliche the corniness for example an evil green fog taking off a girl's clothes and the soundtrack are what make the movie so hilarious and great and of course there's nothing like ozzy osbourne playing a preacher who's asking what happened to the love song definitely a movie for having a few friends over for a good laugh and while you're at it make it a double feature with slumber party massacre 2 there's an evil rocker as stated on the video box driller killer in black leather w fringe a must see for cheesy movie fans,1
this film was amazing it had an original concept that of a vampire movie meets yakuza mob film it is a humorous and yet highly dramatic and tragic movie about friendship love immortality death and happiness and comments subtelly on society on the part of gackt camui the role of sho was excellently delivered and hyde was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured yet humorous vampire kei i also laughed and cried at the happy go lucky character toshi who grew up with sho i loved each and every second of this this film especially moments such as the funny cigarette scene the fighting scenes and most of all the heartrenching ending,1
peter fonda is so intentionally enervated as an actor that his lachrymose line readings cancel out any irony or humor in the dialogue he trades sassy barbs and non witty repartee with brooke shields as if he were a wooden block with receding hair even his smaller touches like fingering a non existent mustache on his grizzled face don't reveal a character so much as an unsure actor being directed by himself an unsure filmmaker in the southwest circa 1950 a poor gambler not above a little cheating wins an orphaned would be teen lolita in a botched poker game after getting hold of a treasure map promising gold in the grand canyon the bickering twosome become prospectors some lovely vistas and an odd but interesting cameo by henry fonda as a grizzled canyon man are the sole compensations in fatigued comedy drama with the two leads being trailed by cartoonish killers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that map shields is very pretty but although the camera loves her pouty glossy beauty she has no screen presence and her tinny voice has no range whatsoever every time she opens her mouth one is inclined to either cringe or duck 1 2 from,0
this had a great cast with big name stars like tyrone power henry fonda randolph scott nancy kelly henry hull and brian donlevey and a bunch more lesser but known names with shorter roles it also had technicolor one of the few movies made with it in 1939 br br now the bad news regrettably i can't say much positive for the story it portrayed the james boys in a totally positive light and hollywood has done that ever since why these criminals are always shown to be the good guys is beyond me this film glamorizes them and made their enemies the railroad people into vicious human beings the latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous well that's the film world for you evil is good good is bad br br hey hollywood here's a news flash the james boys were criminals really look it up,0
how can this movie have a 5 5 this movie was a piece of skunk s t first the actors were really bad i mean chainsaw charlie was so retarded because in the very beginning when he pokes his head into the wooden hut that happened to be about oh 1 quarter of an inch thick that really cheap as flimsy piece of wood and he did not even think he could cut threw it second the person who did the set sucks as at supplying things for them to build with the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this t v show bottom line do not waste your hard earned cash on this hunk of s t they call a movie br br rating 0 3,0
the color purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps those people strongly affected by the struggles of life every character had an element of the color purple in them the movie touches on love lost hope hate and triumph whether it be celie having lived through hell and losing her sister and shug coming into her life to show her love again albert not being man righting his wrong toward celie shug shunned by her father and confesses to him in the end sofia and her stubborness good and bad and even nettie they had their emptiness and hardship through the film but was overcome in the end and that's the sign of a good movie good job to all the cast and crew,1
r balki tries to tell you a story that had been earlier told by ram gopal verma in nishabd in a sensuous way this time it is mixed with mature humors br br amitabh bachchan is a chef and owns an indian cuisine in london he is very dominating and arrogant and respects his job just like any other job according to him cooking is an art still cannot make hyderabadi biryani properly br br enter tabu who sends her the proper hyderabadi biryani made by her and they soon starts meeting up and finally falls in love with each other amitabh is 65 and tabu is 35 no probs but one hitch tabu's father paresh rawal the couples decide to meet the father for the approval of their marriage but amitabh realizes that tabu's father is much younger to him and the complications begin performance wise all three actors are brilliant the script of the film is very tight and interesting the dialogues of the film are catchy but somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled the comedy is sometimes not properly understood the film also tries to go lengthy at some parts br br musically nothing much to sing about except the title track the camera work is good director r balki could have given much better from this script but in the second half he himself looks confused the satyagrah scene of the father looked irritating but the lines spoken by amitabh bachchan during that scene are clap worthy br br on the whole cheeni kum needed to have more sugar,0
this is one of those unfortunate films that suffered an even more sad unfortunate death at the box office i saw this film at a local art cinema in revival form shortly after it tanked in mainstream cinemas it certainly deserves to be approached a second time or even a third sandra b takes it to the limit by doing spoken word taking on some well known songs in this piece her version of hank william's 'i'm so lonesome i could cry' could easily move you to tears maybe someday audiences will be ready to take this film a bit more seriously but not without some well placed laughs too the film moves at a brisk pace thanks to some nice editing so that some viewers will not find it stale boring perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline,1
how can you gather this respectable cast of young british actors and come up with such a pile of filmic manure horrible script annoyingly hectic camera awfully edited gruesomely badly acted only rhys ifans tries to fill his role with life another painful proof that different sometimes equals dreck why do the money people fail to read the scripts beforehand do yourself a favour spare yourself and do something else like hitting a mallet onto your knees it's less painful and more fun than this movie,0
after watching the first 20mn of blanche sorry i couldn't take more of it i have now confirmed she does not br br basically this movie is an insult to the real french actors participating in this farcical piece of junk it starts from a concept successfully used in french comedies deux heures moins le quart avant jesus christ la folie des grandeurs a historical movie with anachronic tone dialogues this can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a finesse of direction avoiding the dreaded heavy comedy stigma br br unfortunately the horsey faced lou doillon ruins everything and blanche instead of a comedy just turns into an horror movie horror to cinephiles who want to be puzzled and shocked watching fine actors such as decaune zem or rochefort struggling in the middle of this gaudy burlesque kitchy prissy farce,0
this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon sure its flawed it does not give a realistic view of homelessness unlike say how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots many of the jokes fall flat but still this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive its not the fisher king but its not crap either my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead i love mel as a director and writer not so much as a lead,1
christopher guest need not worry his supreme hold on the mockumentary sub genre is not in trouble of being upstaged in the least especially not by this extremely unfunny jab at rpg gamers the jokes are beyond lame not enough substance to last the typical length of a particularly rancid snl skit much less the 87 atrocious minutes i waisted watching this drivel the great william katt greatest american hero house deserves much much better one thing and one thing alone makes the fact that i saw this worth it in my mind and that's posting about it on here so hopefully just hopefully i'll save someone such a bad experience br br my grade d br br dvd extras 2 audio commentaries 7 interviews with various cast members 4 deleted scenes theatrical trailer br br dvd rom extras 2 wallpapers br br easter egg highlight the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short scene,0
i think this movie was supposed to be shocking but the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it's been made and simply is it's one and a half hour of torment even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie the five girls br br sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way which is basically fine since it's a horror movie and i usually like horror movies i've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se however all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever it's no spectacle other than that it's simply grotesque it's so lame it even gets boring and really quick too br br the worst thing if the above wasn't bad enough for ya about this movie is that they've tried to copy the blair whitch project by filming with cheap hand held cameras but again this too serves no end whatsoever in the blair which sure enough there's an explanation namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch in this film there's no other explanation than hey ya'll we wanted this to look like the blair whitch the sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about the girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can't make out what they're saying also no effort has been made to make anything any better sound wise or other wise br br than finally there's the soundtrack which is just as bad as the rest and varies from cheap euro house to the worst grungy hard rock br br my advise don't watch this under any circumstances,0
this movie shows a clip of live animal mutilation of an animal getting hacked by a machete and getting its skin ripped off i know these horrible things happen in the world but im watching movies based on the fact that what im watching is not actually happening on the screen these live animal clips are not meant to be in movies they are meant to show people that belong to certain organizations to help the horrible things that humans to do other species br br this should be banned and destroyed i have also contacted netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the market br br this movie should be removed from the public the person who made this movie needs psychological help,0
this is without a doubt the most offensive chick flick i have seen in years if not ever the writing characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film verges on parody before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster we were subjected to the following themes having a baby will solve all of your problems performer types are miserable messes musicians can't be good mothers unless they toss their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle what a waste of a talented cast some great looking sets costumes when natasha richardson told toni collette that unless she lives a more mainstream life she'll end up shudder alone i felt queasy i can't believe this movie made it to theatrical release it's the sort of fare one expects from those women's cable channels that i always pass right by when channel surfing i am female and over 35 so i should be part of this film's target audience but boy does evening miss its target,0
no strings attached is one of carlos mencia's best performances to date mencia is known for poking and making fun of racial issues however he does more than that in this stand up performance which took place in san francisco in general mencia's material does not only make you laugh but it also makes you think about what is really wrong with society today br br in this hour long performance mencia talks about such things as illegal immigration what women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace terrorism his opinion of mel gibson's passion of the christ and an argument that he got into with a woman regarding whether or not he is affected by jesus and how society should treat those that are physically or mentally handicapped mencia even discusses whether or one should have the right to speak out and tell a joke br br carlos mencia is not afraid to offend which at many times gets him trouble with his critics for example he does go somewhat far and he admits it with a joke regarding pope john paul ii and what he is most likely doing in heaven right now br br mencia's main message in all of his performances is that we all have have a voice and that we should use that voice to speak what we feel and not be afraid to offend he reminds us that we have a right to free speech and that we must use this right as americans br br if you enjoy this performance i definitely recommend watching mind of mencia his show on comedy central,1
ok who brought the cheese i love it during it's run it became a phenomenon the anorexic twins became popular bob saget started making a paycheck instead of his really funny stand up and people knew who dave coulier was this is when life was good and simple this is one of the great american classics it was humorous and always brought home a good lesson and this is where i differ from the norm i liked the last few seasons like home improvement when children get older there are a lot more you can do with the script this is why i dare say it could have gone much later than it did but anyway i gave it an 8 10 because of its wholesome funny story lines and because of bob saget,1
hatred of a minute is a hauntingly beautiful film a psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer eric seaver strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a must see for any film student or horror fan the realness of the story and the human side of eric separate this film from other psycho killer movies some shout outs to the film's producer bruce campbell as well as to the film the evil dead add some humor for anyone that knows the genre,1
return to cabin by the lake just was lacking it must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera so within the same scene you'll have some movie quality camera shots and simple video camera shots it makes for a very odd blend i think they should have found some way to not do the home video type effect br br i think it's worthwhile to see it if you have seen the original cbtl because then you can compare and see the differences but if you haven't seen the original cbtl you'll never want to see it if you see this one first it will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one,0
this series would have been a lot better if they had just done one simple thing made ian mcshane code name diamond head instead of code name tree diamond head the character needs someone who could handle the role of the lovable rogue which mcshane proved he could do with the lovejoy series roy thinnes the actual diamond head is really only so so in the role mcshane is not really that good as the bad guy tree france nuyen's character tso tsing can't seem to make up her mind as to whether she's the hapless victim or the tough and ready to fight woman she really earned her pay at the end when she had to play the role of diamond head's lover after viewing an episode or two i ended up not caring what happened to anyone tree gives us a lot to hate him but diamond head gives us nothing to like him unfortunately the spy genre in the 1970s was not quite as it was in the 1960's,0
kol space prisoner on space death row manages to hijack a space shuttle and escape to the woods of america where he along with some new found friend try to escape from the 'alienator a female cyborg killing machine made one year after the best movie of fred olen ray's career hollywood chainsaw hookers this one can't help but feel like a bit of a letdown just as low budget as that earlier film but not nearly as fun as i had with it none of the actors really stood out at me the film is alright for the undiscriminating viewer during a rainy saturday afternoon but that's pretty much all it's good for br br my grade d br br where i saw it showtime thriller,0
there are good ways to make a movie and bad ways and this very much the former this short caper exacts nothing more than what it gives to the audience it presents a simple story told very plainly with enough wisecracks to keep you going then just gets better and better clooney's cameo is funny and very welcome but the leads including sam rockwell and luiz guzman can easily make it on their own likeable and funny hilariously so towards the end welcome to collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre,1
this movie is an incredible piece of work it explores every nook and cranny of the human mind focusing on the characters relationships with the people around them stellar performances all around this one had me weeping for about half an hour straight spend some real time with this one,1
a very tired looking burt reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non heroes plan to sell to the iranians low rent video nonsense by the producers of silk stalkings offers some decent action footage and a lot of ineptly staged drama a lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects although the final twists and allegiance shifts could've been a nifty end to a better movie burt still has presence although it also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly half baked one liners,0
if jean renoir's first film whirlpool of fate first takes us into the world of the countryside the rivers the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great grand illusion and rules of the game this is beautifully filmed with the restless camera making full use of the amazingly huge apartments and backstage areas that dominate the film's interiors and the acting though frequently overwrought offers some great moments as well particularly from werner krauss' muffat but the glamorous and sultry ms hessling who at first appears as if she might give louise brooks a run for her money in vampishness never goes beyond a one note selfish harlot portrayal perhaps this is in part a problem with the script which does seem to mostly go for high points and outraged emotions not having read the novel i'm not really clear on whether the choices were well made or not br br still the differences between nana's suitors are well drawn and i particularly liked the relationship between muffat and jean angelo's vandeuvres the tragic understandings that each seems to have of his ultimate fate and their sympathy with each other particularly in the scene at the bottom of the enormous staircase where vandeuvres warns muffat and we wonder if violence will erupt this and other gleanings of the ridiculousness of the idle rich help give the film the depth it has br br far from his greatest achievement and for me probably just shy overall of whirlpool of fate this is still well worth seeing for renoir fans or those interested in silent cinema generally,1
to be completely honest i haven't seen that many western films but i've seen enough to know what a good one is this by far the worst western on the planet today first off there black people in the wild west come on who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly no no completely retarded secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns thirdly whats with the asian chick speaking perfect english if the setting is western asia isn't where your going finally the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning now don't get me wrong i'm not racist or white either so don't get ticked after reading this but this movie this movie is the worst presentation of black people i have ever seen,0
i don't care how many nominations this junk got for best this and that this movie stunk i didn't know whether to turn off the set or file a lawsuit with o j 's attorney for wrongful damage to my mental health i have seldom been this bored to call this dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every movie goer across the planet the whole story was stupid the acting was uninspired the 'drama' was emotionless i am thankful i didn't have to pay for this unfulfilling experience,0
i don't like this film but then i didn't think much of the book either which although lauded by many as a masterpiece i found lacking in character development and disjointed and illogical in plot although it was far more readable than fante's dreadful first effort road to los angeles not published until fante became fashionable in the mid 80s br br i was intrigued to see what sort of soup towne would make with such meager ingredients he has worked hard script wise to repair the many shortcomings of the book but for my money didn't rescue it there was never a movie in ask the dust while ever he tried to stay faithful to the book i consider this film towne's folly br br in a word forgettable,0
it is not un common to see u s re makes of foreign movies that fall flat on their face but here is the flip side this is an awful re make of the u s movie wide awake by the british br br wide awake is strange but entertaining and funny liam on the other hand is just strange i must give credit to liam for one thing and that is making it clear that i made the right choice in changing my religion,0
well not actually this movie is very entertaining though went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the i think there might be something in my eye routine the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides in fact all the characters are great the movie is not overly funny or sappy good flick to go see with the wife br br all in all 8 10 note i am not an easy grader thats all from bigv over and out,1
i watched this film alone in the dark and it was full moon outside i didn't do it in purpose it just happened in this way so all the elements were there for this film to scare the hell out of me well it didn't in fact i wanted to shut off the dvd player after only 8 minutes but i thought come on give it a chance unfortunately i did the acting was awful the only one with some decent acting was samaire armstrong the plot is not original if you are a horror fan then it is just the same stuff you have seen many times before some scenes didn't make sense at all and you just get the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer the monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie the scary scenes looked like they belong to a horror movie from the 80s when there was not enough technology yet some good movies were made back then i was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the movie i thought couldn't they put some money in this and make it decent i couldn't agree more with the ratings that the movie got it is also my rating for it 3 out of 10,0
this is a typical steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds i wouldn't call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a steele novel knows how they all end if you don't want to know much about the plot don't keep reading br br gilbert's character ophelia is a woman of french decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she otherwise a good actress cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent brad johnson also an excellent actor is matt who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce he is gentle convincing and compelling in this role br br the two meet on the beach through her daughter pip and initially ophelia accuses matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid all of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love br br the chemistry between the two leads is not great even though the talent of these two people is not in my opinion a question they did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical two people meet tragedy bigger tragedy a secret is revealed another tragedy and then they get together i wish there was more to it than that but there it is in a nutshell br br i wanted mindless entertainment and i got it with this in regard to the genre of romantic films this one fails to be memorable a secret affair with janine turner is far superior not a steele book as are some of steele's earlier books turned into film,0
this film has a clear storyline which is quite unusual to the musical genre cats phantom of the opera and other andrew lloyd webber's musicals can be considered metaphorical as they use literary works as their framework biarkan bintang menari bbm 's storyline touches the very core of human relationships especially that of indonesian people despite the fact the film was based on a supposedly fairytale it's actually a fantasy of the 'child' in indonesian adults the dance sequences are not perfect yet the songs represent how indonesians express themselves i reckon the choreographer should explore indonesian way of dancing by not dismaying the fact that indonesia's dance development tends to be more westernized the dance sequences seem awkward in some ways and not synchronized with the songs and or music yet i still love this movie and regard it as a new wave of indonesian film genre which i hope to improve in the future,1
i guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point and that's exactly what embarrassed taft resident jack dundee robin williams intends to do in the best of times yep the man who went all crazy with the radio in good morning vietnam is playing football in this case he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title but ex teammate reno hightower kurt russell isn't just going to go along with it so easily br br granted it's not the best movie for either man but williams and russell are actually a pretty good comedy team and some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles to say the least check it out,1
i enjoyed this movie very much kristy swanson omar epps and ice cube were all great in it the movie dealt with many issues and i didn't know if i was going to like it but singelton did a terrific job of creating characters that you really cared about,1
i don't know if this is a sitcom or not but i agree that this is one of the greatest television shows ever it's great that this show still airs and i love michelle it's cute on the episodes when she was a baby and she talked and she sometimes said something funny aw br br this show can relate to children and teens and well families as they struggle through rough times and try to work it out as a family i don't know who would ever turn down an opportunity to watch this show with someone br br i love the episode when i think her name is dd the older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt and she learned a lesson about stealing that was a great episode an example that this tv show shows the family working things out as a family br br i recommend this show for everyone,1
ok my girlfriend and i rented the dvd and about 30 minutes into the movie we'd exchanged a lot of ehhh what is this movie about and more importantly do i care to find out what it ends with glances and decided we either needed drugs to keep us interested in the plot or just end the pain right there and then and watch something else we opted for the latter br br i liked but i'm a cheerleader a lot but mango kiss is too silly and surreal for my taste sorry i definitely prefer d e b s better than chocolate fucking Åmål goldfish memory and fire br br sorcia,0
kalifornia came out in 1993 just as 3 of the 4 lead characters were up and coming to the levels of fame they now possess in 2006 this is a nice psycho thriller that should appeal to all david duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent narratives that find their ways into his work like with most of his episodes of the x files playing god and red shoe diaries br br people who were put off by the heavy southern accent from brad pitt and juliette lewis' characters obviously have never spent much time in the south for every brian and carrie in the south there is an adele and early and in 2006 that's the real horror of this flick br br aside from that i think the film was written with a cult film intention like with carrie's photography it's not suitable for mass consumption but if you have a copy of this in your personal library i think it says something positive about your tastes for freaky movies,1
i really liked this movie i saw the original classic a few times but could hardly remember any details i think this movie is much better than the cartoon its not so black and white as it i specially liked how they made the grinch such a complete character and gave a cause of why he was the way he was the villain in this movie was not the actual grinch but the major much different than the original cartoon jim carrey was perfect for the part all in all a great movie made for both kids and adults alike,1
i only saw it once this happened in 1952 i was seven the movie 13 br br we were so young but i kept in mind forever the strong moments of gunga's sacrifice br br i realized that time how much a people can be hardly submitted and used by a foreign nation under these historical circumstances in the movie the personal relation of friendship a kind of friendship that ignores itself the one raised between people who share daily life who see each other faces who knows each other names but belong to different worlds can only make appears then in the most critical moments a troubling question emerges whom are we in first supposed to be loyal which people family motherland the person you know close to you you do not have time to give a perfect answer urgency is there and it is for life or death gunga din gives his answer with sacrifice of himself somewhere in a confuse manner a problem remains unsolved the emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until somebody dies just one life nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities we can see today because this death this unique vanishing life i lived it i shared with my child unconditional friendship it was lived by the spectator i was that day i loose gunga din for ever as i left behind later my pretty childhood as i left from then so many worlds i lived in i left all that for good and these lines are today a short visit i didn't expect to do this morning when getting up,1
this is a truly awful film what they have done is taken a tv show which was never aimed at young children given it the george lucas treatment i e ruined it by kiddifying it to appeal to the younger audience br br ok so the thunderbirds tv show wasn't exactly the most cerebral of shows in fact it was pretty formulaic but it was always enjoyable to watch especially when the models got blown up and the voice cast wasn't too bad br br this suffers from bad casting bad acting with the notable exceptions of sophia myles as lady penelope ron cook as parker who seem to be the only cast members to have a clue about how their characters should be played after this travesty i wouldn't let frakes direct traffic br br the whole point of thunderbirds was that it was about the whole tracy family how they worked as a team preventing disasters or coming to the rescue of those involved in disasters br br avoid this rubbish like the plague br br i only give it 1 out of 10 because a zero rating is not supported,0
without effective indulgence of the supernatural or the poetic motivating nuances of humanity all this creative team has to hope for is effective usage of its middling unoriginal elements 'party of five' gone maniacal then genetically unescapable there's little rooting interest because the singular non homicidal element is a second rate bland awful acting 'wes bentley' mopester in fact all of the acting is skin deep even though the dark haired women appeal the salaciousness is kept to a minimum no nudity here also lacking are sufficient buckets of blood all sensations are kept at a teasing safe distance an unfortunate fact considering the given name of the directors is 'butcher ' only the soundtrack the droning angsty alt country and the tense fluctuating score provide any palpable tension sometimes some static storyboarded compositions add appealing low angles that adds to the malaise but for a film that calls itself horror i did not even get close to flinching once perhaps a greater emphasis on societal rejuvenation through blood intake scenes directed with varying geometric shapes outside the square and a sustained focus on playfulness through the family's maliciousness or traps sympathetic characters need to escape in order to escape their dilemma would have improved my opinion but this was not a good start to my excursion through horrorfest,0
there's perhaps a special reason why the fox and the child hit a special note in my heart having just said goodbye to my new fiancée of oh one day for an unknown period of time i was a bit overwhelmed with varying emotions and was suffering the fallout from putting on the brave face she needed to see br br i watched a few movies and tv shows but my interest darted from what i was leaving behind to what is out there and what i haven't seen for that i have this movie to thank br br being a nature lover and having heard about the film beforehand i was sure i was going to like it anyway but i didn't just like it i loved it br br the technical mastery is astounding how did they do it how did they capture the animals in the way they did it's just wonderful br br the moral of the tale is a good one and while the ending is oh so french and ambiguous it's a happy sad one again it caught me a bit off guard as a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself the ending was tough going while on a plane full of people i would be seeing for the next 15 or so hours perhaps it's because the ending made me think back to what i left br br but for those few hours on the plane i was happy to see something new and original and that's life sure there are those things you love and feel comfortable around but the great outdoors holds many a mystery so the next time i see something out of the ordinary while out in the open i'm going to explore it observe it and embrace it that's precisely what happens in this movie and that's precisely what you should do with this darn good movie nature doc too 8 10 br br p s it's two months on from the plane journey we still don't know when we'll see each other again but we will,1
for daniel auteuil queen margot' was much better for nastassja kinski paris texas' was much better the biggest disappointments were from chris menges crisscross' and a world apart' cannot even be compared with this one and goran bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from queen margot' for this movie attention to the end of the film if this was an american pop movie i would not feel surprised at all but for a european film with more independent actors and director a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simple minded and disappointing there are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people there are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone and finally there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys every character is shown in simple black and white terms the good versus the evil plus from the very beginning i could understand how the story would end is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse i believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie i think this movie was not disturbing but very disappointing,0
i loved this movie i knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series i found it very heart warming to see adam west burt ward frank gorshin and julie newmar all back together once again anyone who loved the batman series from the 60's should have enjoyed return to the batcave you could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film especially adam west and i'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it now they wished they had i have all of the original 120 episodes on vhs now this movie will join my collection thank you for the reunion adam and burt,1

three tales are told in this film that seemed to have been shot without knowledge of this being a combined vignette film the makers relate the three vignettes by having them all connected to shrink martin kove although you never see some of the leads with kove br br the first vignette has sexy vivian schilling a woman afraid of everything under the sun she makes adrian monk look brave having a paranoia laced evening at home alone you will literally scream at vivian for doing some ridiculous things she spends the majority of her time in a nighty which shows off her amazing features but her film is the worst if not the most nail biting br br the second vignette is owned by bill paxton as he portrays the roommate from hell his geeky roommate allows him to take complete advantage of him and bill does so whenever he can br br the last vignette was funny as a man fears that death will take him at any moment much like his pal who choked to death on an olive br br not very interesting as the movie as a whole seems chopped together with very little thought involved a must for bill paxton fans,0

this was a new alltime low among westerns the writing is excruciatingly bad characters are impossible to emphasize with and are either disgusting or bland the violence is appalling and technically not very convincingly executed and tobey maguire shows us the flip side of his talent sleepwalking through his part with those expressionless eyes and that raspy voice of his that here betrays only mannerism 'ride with the devil' is among my five worst movie experiences ever a western never to be surpassed in the negative respect,0
this film has an interesting plot but the acting is quite bad and the script is poor i was very disappointed the moral dilemma faced by the main character is an intriguing one but due to poor writing and casting this potentially winning premise is plundered 2 of the 4 other people in the theater left after about 45 minutes and the other 2 were laughing at how bad the film was i stuck it out to the end but i must admit i played blackjack on my cell phone to make the last 30 minutes bearable,0
why did it sound like the husband kept calling her appy it ruined a great episode and so i can only give it a 6 proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film br br it was very hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though i dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die the more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining br br i do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre br br 6 10 come on yankies get your english up to par,1
the first question that springs to mind after watching this rubbish is who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the omen name on this movie it is a shambolic embarrassing pathetic atempt to carry on the omen franchise when the film starts the backing music sounds like it has been lifted straight from a bugs bunny cartoon and from then on the film gets worse i dont know who wrote the script but i bet they got a e for it when they took it back to show their teacher it is difficult after a while to tell if this is a comedy because what happens is so funny and so un true to the original omen it beggers belief the acting is laughable especially from the leading lady faye grant she keeps pulling silly faces or is she finding it difficult not to laugh it's hard to tell the worst sequal i have ever had the misfortune to witness 1 out of 10,0
john candy's performance in once upon a crime is possibly his best ever it's been my favourite movie since it came out i spent 5 years searching for it that's how good it is if you disagree well that's your opinion enjoy the movie,1
i was pretty surprised with this flick even though their budjet was obviously lacking still you have to be impressed that this movie took 7 years to make and still turned out good the acting was pretty impressive and the story really captivated me my only complaint would be that the ending really was a little too abrupt for my taste but hey if your audience is left wanting more then this movie has succeeded br br i would really recommend anyone in hollywood to look up antonella ríos who is an excellent spanish talent something hard to find now days with all the bad novela over acting antonella ríos truly is a star on the rise,1
a mock documentary about a pair of canadian producers bobby myers matthew modine and paul linder saul rubinek trying to make their first film in the late 1970s hollywood north is the comic tale of their struggle to pull everything together despite a number of conflicting threads br br hollywood north works as a film in a way very similar to why this is spinal tap 1984 works so well namely although exaggerated in some ways it is very close to the truth and the truth consists of behind the scenes facts that are very different than the public face of the industry it isn't easy to make a film and it must have been especially difficult in canada in the late 1970s films involve tens if not hundreds of people many have incompatible desires motivations and personalities especially crucial are the financiers and the on screen talent as if either drops out or becomes undependable at any stage while the film is in production it could jeopardize the whole affair either necessitating extensive reshoots or abandoning the film altogether br br so it's not surprising that hollywood north focuses on those kinds of relationships the result is an excellent film that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time the script is flawless and the performances are top notch this is a must see for any budding filmmaker and anyone with a serious interest in the craft of film making it should also be more than entertaining for any viewer with a modicum of intelligence and a sense of humor br br a 10 out of 10 from me,1
i don't hand out ones often but if there was ever a film that deserved this sort of attention it's gas this is self indulgent crap that reaches for some of the ambiance of m a s h and falls completely flat on its face in the attempt br br i see what corman was going for malcolm marmorstein and elliott gould tried to reproduce gould's deathless role in the original movie version of m a s h with a similar plot in the movie whiffs look it up here in imdb http www imdb com title tt0073891 for more information br br marmorstein and gould got closer to the brass ring with whiffs than corman did with gas but didn't quite get there neither one of those films even got close to the success of m a s h br br what's wrong with gas what isn't no one comes close to really acting at a level above junior high school theatrics the production values stink someone else here mentioned the magically regenerating headlights on a getaway car and there's more of that lack of attention to detail nothing works the way it's supposed to in this film and nobody cares br br gas actually put me to sleep it's not a sure cure for insomnia but really close on the cinematic sleep induction scale gas falls somewhere between last year at marienbad and george clooney's remake of solaris which itself was remarkable for being more boring than the mosfilm original despite that studio's seeming unfamiliarity with the idea of keeping the audience's attention by judicious editing br br judicious editing would have decimated gas to about twenty minutes the result would be pointless but no more so than the original film br br certain films are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching anyway this isn't one of them don't waste your time it's not even amusingly bad,0
this was one of the highlights of st tng's semi forgettable second season before they 'grew up' or grew into their own in the third season and beyond this was not only a showcase for up and comers like bill campbell and teri hatcher but was also the continuation of data's search for his 'humanity' this time through the concept of comedy still one of my favorite episodes br br on a side note i'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with whose character okona was about to have a tryst after teri hatcher's character before being rudely interrupted by lt worf i remember watching this episode 'first run' at my friends comic shop back in the day and we all thought she would've been a perfect jean grey marvel girl br br it would be nice to know who this pretty lady actually is,1
this movie is very entertaining and is never ever boring even running at nearly 3 hours al pacino michelle phieffer and the rest of the cast are great in the film and are very believable the violence was a little extreme in the film but then it showed how vicious the drug trade was at the time of the film the ending is amazing and is probalby one of the coolest scenes ever great movie and you will probably really enjoy it,1
this movie is so bad you almost feel contaminated by it actually there is a strong sense of relief when it's over relief that you can now put the cassette back in the rewinder and rush this back to the video rental store before it contaminates the rest of your video collection i jokingly suggested when we rented it that it looked like the kind of film where william hurt would phone in his performance i meant that he would not be trying very hard but lo and behold in a huge number of scenes in this film bill hurt is actually on the phone our realization of this irony was the only pleasure we derived from this confusing mess the cinematography and editing are murky and befuddled the story is chaotic and the soundtrack is barely audible there is a very slight resemblance to falling down but that film had a boldly disturbing story line great writing and acting and an engaging soundtrack contaminated man is just some kind of broken down old european tourist trap and watching it is like driving along some unfamiliar back road in an unknown country where you don't speak the language in a steady rain just after nightfall as the windshield keeps fogging up you get the picture don't get this one,0
i was about 7 when this dire monstrosity of a film was released in the uk it was advertised on the tv in the summer of 1977 for weeks as if it were some incredible blockbuster film it was actually the first film i ever saw at a cinema and i was put off going for years to come the following week i was invited to go and see the new film star wars and i declined to this day i have never seen it in protest at having to watch sasquatch seriously even at the age of 7 i could tell that i was watching garbage it's just so bad it's almost unbelievable rambling nonsense that should never have made it to a cinema i was however amused to read all these years later that the director never directed again just as well as far as i'm concerned avoid at all costs,0
on the surface this is an above average post war romantic comedy beneath the veneer it is mgm character actor stunt casting at its funniest br br the leads are straightforward but all the secondaries are cast much against type margaret hamilton aka wicked witch of the west edward everett horton professional obsessive compulsive fussbudget and sig ruman the marx brothers' nemesis in night in casablanca and the always wonderful night at the opera playing a well intentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together instead of driving them apart as their usual characters would do br br it also pokes fun at many romantic comedy conventions which is another indication that this could be not so much a straight romantic comedy as it is a wry send up of the many post war romantic comedies their 2 dimensional stock characters br br i've seen it only once with interruptions so i can't be positive but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made but is less successful now that viewers see these secondary characters through a completely different lens i'm assuming this is the case when i give it 9 stars i thought it was hysterical,1
i was too young to remmeber when i first saw this movie but i saw it for like the second time about 7 years ago my sister told me i had to see it now my whole family has it memorized we quote it at least once a day i absolutly love this movie i still laugh after all this time sure it's about a really really drunk millionare that is irresponsible the whole point is that he still has the humanity lost in the others that we see in the movie and that he is willing to give it all up for love i highly recomend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh a lot of laughs its hallarious sweet and if your a movie buff it will truely change your idea of funny watch it with a group of your friends or your family and i promise you will never have nothing to talk about ever again with some authur lines in your head it will make you laugh for years to come br br it is really hard in my family to find a movie that everyone likes but this movie i feel made us closer and i know it will do the same for you,1
i would give this show a ten out of ten if it was not for the fart jokes you people are so damn sensitive it is inane so quick to point out the racism of the show and the jokes yet are also so quick to say ridiculously sexist pig headed crap like well duh some of these other shows do these jokes so much better because at least they have hot women so disgusting abortion jokes are great because really who takes abortion seriously anyways at least i'm not a bore son i hear that reba mcentire and sarah silverman are teaming up to do a movie about sisters taking a road trip together talk about a movie of the year,1
i saw arthur the tv series and the books years ago and never was fond of the show very much if you're a fan of this cartoon sorry if i'm spoiling it for you but this is actually what i think lots of people liked it but i didn't br br the school kids characters seemed to fought all the time especially arther and dw they were nice to each other frequently but gradually i got tired of arthur's complaining attitude towards everyone and his sister dw however the name was spelled and dw was an adhd or add like 4 year old sister of arthur who was sometimes demanding which could be why arthur got annoyed with what her routines were like her imaginary friend and her stuffed animal collection etc arthur's friends acted like teenagers instead of what they were like in the arthur books and the parents well they didn't care very much br br the greatest cartoon was rocko's modern life not arthur no offense,0
one of the most frightening game experiences ever that will make you keep the lights on next to your bed great storyline with a romantic horrific and ironic plot fans of the original resident evil will be in for a surprise of a returning character not to mention that the voice acting have drastically improved over the previous of the series don't miss out on the best of the series,1
this is not so much film as big budget children's television as far as i can tell the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans this theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as 'insomnia' when it's first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia i thought wow a nihilistic martial arts film but no such luck although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old man's long white eyebrows zu warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off that's not a good sign i found the special effects to be somewhere between ray harryhausen and xena warrior princess primitive,0
this film is one of those that has a resounding familiarity to it it is earthy grounded and a film that will make you think and smile paul reiser and peter falk take you on a journey that you will not forget the soundtrack is beautifully varied and fitting and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air this surely deserves recognition for both the film and the actors finally a piece of art that departs from the obvious love story and the frequent special affects that are seen today never have i walked out from a movie with such deep warmth and feeling of thoughtfulness in my heart for it felt as if someone had just wrapped it in a fluffy fleece blanket to see this film is to find a real treasure and delight in it,1
deep sh is more like it the eels are just cartooned in over the film think the incredible mr limpet meets leviathan very tacky br br no character or relationship development so called romantic scenes very corny and predictable an interesting idea but a poorly written script and lousy special effects make this a definite must miss,0
i put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home because i had packed away all their toys toddlers don't like to watch regis and kathie lee or the view my four year old found one scene funny but told me the rest of it was too silly this is a four year old folks anyone over the age of say nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out br br to say this movie is bad is like saying the holocaust was a little mistake there are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this film truly is the acting is bad the plot is stupid and the script is pathetically unfunny since this is supposed to be a comedy the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse bronson balki pinchot is the worst with some weird fake accent irish pakistani bronx cockney cajun as far as i could tell but all the characters are awful i haven't watched a real laurel and hardy film in ages but i know that they had to be way better than this what is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with this br br bottom line derivative garbage avoid at all costs unless you have some freaky bronson pinchot fetish 2 10,0
a young scientist harry harrison is continuing his late father's scientific research into limb regeneration with flying colours but his interferingly dominate mother and her doctor lover want to sell off the serum when he finds out there is an accident involving harry losing an arm so he tries out the serum and what eventuates is a genetically deranged arm that has a mind of its own br br oh we've seen this oh so many times before but what lifts this very campy and quite rubbery shonky junk is the performance of movie icons elke sommer and oliver reed actually it's not a bad flick by fangoria films just there are better ones out there which are similar in vein servered ties simply lacks it own distinctive style the oddball nature and unpleasant splatter resembled re animator and even a touch of slapstick stuck out like something from evil dead 2 br br the comic story is truly whacked out with it's black humour but it can get melodramatic and a bit in dry in the fun factor surprises do crop up especially the flick's final outcome which is well accepted as i thought it could have copped out with something more accessible for a low budget production the fx makeup can look rigid and very goofy but there's some grotesque moments that will make you smile than actually cringe even a brush of sexual tension streamlines the story thanks to elke sommer's sternly juicy performance as the mother oliver reed is quite humorously deadpan in a wicked sense and he pulls it off extremely well they were both immensely diverting as the couple you loved to hate billy morrisette is delightful in a erratic performance as harry director damon santostefano briskly paces the film and orchestrates some stylish scenes of gripping and bamboozling horror br br yeah it's juvenile and basically silly nonsense but you got to hand it to it for some undemanding entertainment,0
i have to say seventeen missing is much better than i expected the perception i took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum but i was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mystery br br dedee pfeiffer is emilie a mom who insists her daughter lori tegan moss not attend a so called graduation party one weeknight but lori ignores her mother's wishes and takes off for the party anyway when lori does not come home emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance br br seventeen missing is better than so many other tv movies of this type as it is not so predictable pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie and most of it comes off as believable this lmn original movie premiered last night 10 10,1

the scenes are fast paced the characters are great i love anne marie johnson's acting i really like the ending br br however i was disappointed that this movie didn't delve deeper into achilles's and athena's relationship it only blossomed when they kissed each other,1
this movie rocks jen sexy as ever and polly wow were we really ever that young this movie can still touch the hearts of a lot of teens it needs to be put on dvd soon or it will become a classic i really enjoyed growing up to this movie i have always had a crush on jen now i am too old but to this movie is made for all gens you know i come from the early 80 s area were i had to watch everyone els live the life i wanted but thru movies i can do that all over again i guess in short i am hoping and wishing that this movie not be lost in time but reborn to the youth so they may enjoy the heart warm filling you get learning about hormones and datting problems and how to get away with stuff that seems so major back then but don't mean nothan now so this movie is a dating tool,1
excellent political thriller played much quieter and slower than other higher ranking films in this genre when people talk about pacino and cusack how do they manage to skip over these amazing career topping performances a story of friendships father son relationships corruption and deceit the two actors gel amazingly well together and the supports from aiello and fonda are equally as impressive although aiello is brilliant especially when the papers run to press instead of focussing on an over complex corruption scandal it creates wonderful characters who show the human side of failure an political bribery the final scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and acted,1
the reason the dvd releases of this film are in black and white is because nobody can get their hands on a color print of this public domain film a modest sea story at best br br distributed for television thru allied artists dvd's or vhs on the market at this time for this title are all coming from the same 16mm television print films distributed for television prior to 1963 were often distributed in b w prints because the bulk of viewers did not have color sets anyway striking b w prints for television was also cheaper as it often involved quite a few prints to cover all stations running a film on a syndicated basis,0
i must be that one guy in america that didn't like this movie i guess this just wasn't my style or something i just don't see what's so fascinating about it this was barely entertaining let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history br br it's about a guy that came from nothing and goes on to become a drug lord pretty simple way to describe an entire movie and that's exactly my feeling about the entire movie contrary to what a lot of people think just because a movie is about mafias drug trade criminal groups doesn't automatically make it a great movie don't forget good storytelling,0
i really liked the movie i remember reading it several times as a kid and was glad to see a movie had been made about the book br br i was kid sitting for a boy and a girl ages 11 and 8 and had to talk the girl in to seeing the movie but happily at the end she was glad she saw it and even said that she wanted to buy it on dvd as soon as it came out br br there were some great laugh out loud moments and the movie was not as gross as i expected it would be tho it did rank pretty high up there on the gross o meter br br the only thing i cannot figure out is why they had to have the dilly line in there that was done by woody in reference to his private part that to me was the only shocker moment and you could hear the adults in the audience audibly gasp at that moment in the movie i have no clue why that was put in the movie it added nothing to the actual movie except for that shock gasp factor other than that a pretty good movie nice to see the pepsi girl all grown up,1
after all these years i still consider this series the finest example of world war ii documentary film making the interviews with the many participants from all countries set this apart from any other project it would be great to see a contemporary documentarian ken burns take on this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone with modern technology to improve old archival footage and lots of information that has been unearthed since 1974 when the world at war was produced an updated version of this series would be welcome the history channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of wwii but an expansive series such as the world at war has not been successfully attempted since the original if you are interested in this era don't miss this series it is required viewing,1
it doesn't take long to see why code name diamond head didn't make it onto the network schedules the tv pilot movie doesn't get past the credits before it's obvious just how bad it's going to be maybe i missed something because the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense based on what i got out of the muddled mess a terrorist or thief or something named tree ian mcshane goes to hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon the world's dullest secret agent johnny paul roy thinnes is out to stop him there might have been more but trust me  it really doesn't matter anyway br br action movies should have action suspenseful moments should have suspense and dramatic moments should have drama there's none of that in code name diamond head i've seen others use the word turgid to describe this made for tv snoozer  and it's better than any one word description i can come up with none of the characters is in the least bit exciting or worth caring about and roy thinnes makes for the worst leads imaginable his charisma is just slightly north of a slug ian mcshane is easily the best thing the movie has going for it but unfortunately for everyone else involved it doesn't appear he was going to be back as a regular cast member now if mcshane had been cast in the series lead well then you might have had something br br i'm quickly discovering that these gawd awful 70s made for tv movies make great mystery science theater 3000 episodes and that goes double if quinn martin was involved very funny stuff from mike and the bots so while i may only give the movie a 3 10 i rate episode 608 a 4 5 on my mst3k rating scale,0
this is perhaps the best rockumentary ever a british better this is spinal tap the characters are believable the plot is great and you can genuinely empathise with some of the events such as ray's problem with fitting in the band br br the soundtrack is excellent real period stuff even if it is in the same key you'll be humming some of the songs for days what i liked was the nearly all british cast with some of the favourite household names ray's wife is priceless br br the film never drags it just goes at the right pace and has some genuinely funny sections in it a generator of some really good catchphrases br br it's a hidden diamond,1
the name cult movie is often given to films which continue to be screened or to sell in home movie format more than a generation after they were first released superchick which was first released in 1973 now comes into this category its cult status is largely due to ongoing interest in it by those women who regard it as an early and effective feminist film br br despite the superwoman connotation superchick is not a cartoon character but a very competent young lady working as an air stewardess a career option which in the 1970's was commonly regarded as one of the most glamorous open to any girl and which also enables her to emulate the traditional matelot who reputedly has a wife in every port since she holds black belt status in karate she is in a position to make it quite clear that she is very happy with her bachelor existence and is in no way beholden to any of her extensive suite of male admirers this film is a situation comedy which avoids the generally much shorter lived appeal of outright farce its appeal to feminists is also heightened by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate abilities to avert a hijacking and save all the other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate to ensure that this film will appeal to men as well as to their partners the director has wisely ensured that is liberally sprinkled with eye candy br br superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light easy to watch comedy which they will forget soon after viewing it is so forgettable that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if watched again in a year's time despite its age it may therefore retain its status as a cult movie for some time to come however the dialogue and acting would make it hard to give this film a rating of more than 4 10,0
no sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that here's a few different slants on it from one of those religious nuts as one bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerantly br br 1 baby face 1933 offers perhaps the classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex there is a lot of truth to what barbara stanwyck demonstrates in this film look cute bat your eyelashes offer your body for free and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want br br in this case it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money lots of it at least four men in this film do provide just that even if it ruins their lives in the process br br 2 the ending which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate gives another great message all the money and material goods in the world won't make a person feel fulfilled a sad comment that so many critics here would rather have immoral messages preferring sleaze over substance no surprise i guess br br any way you look at it the movie is entertaining start to finish and stanwyck has some great lines particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customers at a little over 70 minutes this film moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it,1
this is actually a pretty bad film the ideology is not as perverse as in those films collins made later however my main misgivings about the film are that it is implausible and quite frankly boring for a long time the whole concept of an ex sas man joining terrorists for no particular reason isn't very convincing and you can't help wondering why a group of highly organized terrorists who later become pretty clueless fall for it the film starts with a pretty powerful scene but then meanders for quite a long time building up towards the great finale overall i think who dares wins could have been an interesting 45 minutes episode of the professionals but the story doesn't carry a feature film although reasonably successful at the time this film initiated the demise of collins' career who in the eighties mainly made cheap and dubious soldier of fortune or army films pity because he actually is quite a versatile actor but at the end of the day martin shaw chose his roles more carefully and has a career that's still successful,0
to quote flik that was my reaction exactly wow you're perfect this is the best movie i think i can even say it's become my favorite movie ever even wow i tell you what wow,1
i'd passed this title 15 or 20 times while in blockbuster looking for something halfway decent to watch all i can say is that they were all out halfway decent films the night i chose to rent this br br i will give it credit for being leaps and bounds better than dracula 3000 but in actuality that's pretty easy to say since this one didn't have caper van dien in it the other things it lacked in spades were an interesting cast interesting story good dialog and originality but i suppose you can't have everything br br spoilers ahead the misfit crew of vampire hunters one of which was a vampire go figure flew around from mining colony to mining colony trying to wipe out all the vampires it could find the crew consists of the cocky ne'er do well captain who dies early on his by the book yet inexperienced first mate the aforementioned vampire vampire hunter not a typo a wannabe cowboy and a really really butch asian commando tough guy female it almost sounds like the cast for mtv's 'the real world' after the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a mob of bloodsuckers and as it turns out lovers of the finer parts of human anatomy his first mate takes over blah blah blah everyone hates him blah blah blah i could go on but as i said it's the same storyline used in about a hundred other 'films' of the genre br br the effects were cheese and why michael ironside was in this movie is beyond me the vampire vampire hunter still not a typo was pretty hot but of course if you're waiting for her to expose more than just her cleavage look elsewhere br br i can't say that it was the worst film i've seen as i actually rented 'starship troopers 2' but wait for this one to come on the sci fi channel,0
some films just simply should not be remade this is one of them in and of itself it is not a bad film but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title liam neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of owen wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more,1
this movie is so awful it is hard to find the right words to describe it br br at first the story is so ridiculous a narrow minded human can write a better plot the actors are boring and untalented perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy film br br the camera receptions of the national forest are the only good in this whole movie i should feel ashame because i paid for this lousy picture br br hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline,0
this movie was banned in england why tom savini george romero dario argento lucio fulci and others had done far worse before and have continued to so since br br this movie has all the basic elements of a decent 70s or early 80's horror film good looking girls who can't act to save their lives by the way a terrible lightning storm with a torrential downpour a scythe a crazy brother wandering around the family estate and actually a pretty damn good twist at the end but banned seriously when the english parliament banned this movie the italians probably laughed their collective asses off at how backwards and prudish the brits really were br br there was maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to the violence and gore which was greatly underdone there was nudity but no sex although allusions to sex were made obviously but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned br br i would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with as it stands the film is entertaining but the lack of picture and sound quality take away from the end result br br banned what a joke,0
this is one of those cheaply made tv movies were the characters seem to lose all sense the premise of the story the kidnapping of a son by the boy's father is very good but the story just seems to beggar belief whenever the mother is advised not to do anything you know fine well she is going to do it it is a bit far fetched and not worthy of a viewing,0
typically kids films have some annoying quality to it that makes it way too sappy and unbearable for someone over 13 but then again that's before holes hit the scene sure it has the very same moments that often times give a kids movie its aforementioned quality but this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions the acting was decent and the uneasy dynamics that stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than what most movies seek to portray what i especially liked about this movie was the fact that this film didn't try to break your heart or make you cry the emotional power was a little more natural than most would imagine kind of like the shawshank redemption in many ways which holes also has a similar redemptive ending to it the only down side the hokey looking lizards overall however an 8 10,1
this inferior sequel based by the characters created by david selzer and harvey bernhard also producer concern on a matrimony named gene michael woods and karen york faye grant they adopt a little girl named delia from a convent gene york about re elect for congressman and he presides the financing committee meanwhile delia seems to be around when inexplicable deaths happen she creates wreak havoc when goes a metaphysical fair as stores of numerology therapy counselling heal yoga tarots among others are destroyed karen york hires an eye private michael lerner to investigate the weird and bizarre events br br this tv sequel displays thrills chills creepy events and gory killing delia such as damien seems to dispatch new eerie murder every few minutes of film happening horrible killings the chief excitement lies in watching what new and innocent victim can be made by the middling special effects furthermore mediocre protagonists faye grant and michael woods however nice cast secondary such as michael lerner madison mason duncan fraser and the recently deceased don s davis he was an army captain turned into acting as always excellent musical score taken from omen i and iii by the great jerry goldsmith the movie is exclusively for hardcore followers omen saga the motion picture is badly directed by jorge montesi and dominique othenin girard previous and much better versions are the following the immensely superior original 'omen' gregory peck lee remick by richard donner 'damien' william holden lee grant by don taylor 'final conflict' sam neil and tisa harrow by grahame baker rating below average,0
although at one point i thought this was going to turn into the graduate i have to say that the mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman br br i'm so glad this is a british film because hollywood never would have done it and even if they had they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters br br the story is revealed slowly and realistically the acting is superb the characters are believably flawed and the dialogue is sensitive i tried many times to predict what was going to happen and i was always wrong so i was very intrigued by the story br br i highly recommend this movie and i must confess i'll forever look at my mom in a different light,1
gillian anderson is an arrogant driven career woman who picks up working class oik danny dyer for a night of fun after a stupid accident in the countryside they are brutally attacked after recovering and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers their thoughts turn to that of revenge br br i thought straightheads was terrible violent brutal misogynistic and unpleasant if i didn't dislike the phrase a great deal i would call straightheads a video nasty certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980's frankly i don't know how straightheads got a cinema release br br i am not a prude i don't mind sex and violence in the movies but they have to be married to a movie with a a good plot or b good characterisation or c preferably both straightheads had neither no progression in the plot or the characters and too much left unexplained and unsaid luckily straightheads went nowhere fast it was only 80 minutes long br br it was a shame because there was the germ of an interesting film here with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third how often do i say this but it could have been good if it had been done properly what a shame i really like gillian anderson and danny dyer but they were on a hiding to nothing with this film she especially is very underrated and is still particularly fit br br if you want to see a good british revenge movie rent or buy shane meadows' dead man's shoes it is a little masterpiece last weekend i should have seen his this is england instead ce sera sera,0
this movie has some beautiful sets and albert finney does a great job as the ruthless father the movie fails because jennifer jason leigh is too jumpy as the daughter and is no match whatever for olivia de havilland's far more nuanced mature rendering in the heiress 1949 the film's feminist leaning conclusion also goes against the austere conclusion of the novel washington square whose author henry james savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels as a fan of old hollywood and great literature i found this movie very disappointing,0
i am a huge charlton heston fan he is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time but what was he thinking when he made this movie normally if he made a bad movie i could blame it on the screenwriter or director but in this case it's all him the suckiness of this movie is all his fault it proves that not even heston can make a shakespeare story interesting i wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this snooze fest and i'll never get that time back this is by far the worst heston movie that i've ever seen if you are a shakespeare fan maybe you'll find this movie entertaining but if you're not don't waste your time you'll regret it in the long run,0
i'm watching the series again now that it's out on dvd yay it's striking me as fresh as relevant and as intriguing as when it first aired br br the central performances are gripping the scripts are layered br br i'll stick my neck out and put it up there with the prisoner as a show that'll be winning new fans and still be watched come 2035 br br i've been asked to write some more line it seems imdb is as user unfriendly and anally retentively coded as ever pithy and to the point is clearly not the imdb way br br well unlike imdb's submissions editors american gothic understands that simplicity is everything br br in 22 episodes the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons on top of which it questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way which challenges the viewer at every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation br br when the show first aired i was still grieving for twin peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock off personally i'm starting to rate it more highly and suspect it will stand up better over the years reckon it don't get more controversial than that,1
i rented this film on netflix after it won all the oscars to see if it was really that good br br the hurt locker is a very realistic portrayal for the most part of a group of soldier's rotation in iraq the film centers around will james a reckless soldier who gets his adrenaline fix from taking risks and defusing bombs br br where this film seems to lack in my opinion is the plot and direction of the movie this film has no clear plot unlike other films such as black hawk down what this film tries to do is focus more on the characters and their different attitudes about the war bigelow does an okay job of focusing on the characters but there are many points in the film where the dialogue seems to drag hurt locker is 131 minutes long yet it feels like a 3 hour movie br br one scene in the movie that was particularly awful and ruined the films perfect credibility was the sniping scene halfway through the movie it was both unrealistic and very long br br overall i thought this film was okay but the reason i gave it a 6 instead of a 7 was because it was a major letdown for winning best picture at the oscars i felt like this film could have been so much better considering saving private ryan lost best picture but was much better than this film another notable mention is black hawk down which only won 2 oscars i honestly do not know how this won best picture br br if you are looking for an action packed war flick rent black hawk down this film will be forgotten in a year or two,0
okay if you have a couple hours to waste or if you just really hate your life i would say watch this movie if anything it's good for a few laughs not only do you have obese topless natives but also special effects so bad they are probably outlawed in most states seriuosly the rating of 'pg' is pretty humorous too once you see the native porn extravaganza i wouldn't give this movie to my retarded nephew you couldn't even show this to iraqi prisoners without violating the geneva convention the plot is sketchy and cliché and dumb and stupid the acting is horrible and the ending is so painful to watch i actually began pouring salt into my eye just to take my mind off of the idiocy filling my tv screen,0
i would say for it's time this movie was awesome and yes if you have no desire to become a christian then why bother watching it i saw this movie after i had already been saved and found it to be very moving i see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the left behind series they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people i think in order to actually judge this movie you should see it there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if i am not mistaken don't use our comments to judge see the movie for yourself god will bless you if that is why you are watching them,1
ok i will admit it started out very pleasing and good but then it just dropped downhill i cannot believe sarah michelle gellar could have even finished reading the script after about 5 minutes into the movie the only reason i actually sat through the whole movie was i wanted to see the twist at the ned and to my surprise well folks i cannot even tell you if there ven was one because the end just leaves you confused and then the credit role i was like what the hell this did not deserve a theater run i am sorry but it didn't i mean it was horrible the only reaso i gave it a 4 is because it had a few jumpy parts thats it you can watch it im not telling you not to hey you might even like it or even love it but if you hate it don't say i didn't warn you,0
goodnight mister tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of england where the sun always seems to shine before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of world war ii soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from london and when shy little william is billeted with reluctant gruff old tom who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold our tale begins br br and what a load of sentimental claptrap it is in fact it's just the old odd couple buddy formula aren't any new stories being written br br as i suggested there's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in london apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around and certainly no hint of the horror of the blitz as london's citizens file politely into air raid shelters even when the local schoolteacher's husband is declared missing presumed killed he is later restored to life br br i found goodnight mister tom' cliched and obvious and john thaw's accent conjured up a picture of ronnie barker of the two ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his country bumpkin' accent br br incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that i disliked it and looking at fellow imdb reviewers i seem to be in a minority of one br br,0
this is without a doubt the greatest film ever made it is nearly incomprehensible even with many repeated viewings in an attempt to figure out what exactly's going on the film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers commercials contests one enters by mail and a host of other innovations besides what other movies have cameos by martin luther king jr to decipher the film hunt down the director's book entitled i was curious it'll all become clear it's a grand and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking a triumph now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color other than white the white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible,1
i went to see this movie with the most positive expectations i had seen jacquet's previous movie march of the penguins and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio however i was severely disappointed most of all this movie is terribly boring literally nothing happens i tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend and we both ended up laughing because i could only stammer things like well then the winter comes and then spring and then there's an eagle and a river and one time it is dark and the girl goes into a cave and another time the fox has babies and so on after about half an hour i began sighing yawning rolling my eyes cursing the reviewer at the radio station and hoping that it would be over soon but the movie went on and on when it finally ended i had sunken so deep into my chair that i must have looked somewhat similar to stephen hawking the most annoying parts of the movie are a the girl who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with she wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie one year and shows exactly two facial expressions joy and seriousness she is cute no question about that however a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her all too human presence i found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear drown in the river or something similarly terrible b the commentary by the girl's adult voice which tells us nothing but negligible obvious boring redundant things c the music which is desperately lacking subtlety when the girl is happily jumping around the music jumps around too when the fox is threatened by an eagle the music becomes threatening too it reminded me of the very early days of film making and was just too predictable to enjoy admittedly many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it at least they got somehow involved thus my warning concerns adults only if you are over ten years old avoid this movie you can get a better and cheaper sleep in most other places,0
is miike like chabrol alternating art with dreck sometimes confusing the two does he match the fifty fifty rate some claim for chabrol do we see here too much or too little miike i don't know i don't know i don't know but i could easily fill ten lines just citing chakushin ari's one missed call's steals allusions and clichés others here will hit on most of them though not perhaps ochiai's saimin hypnosis for the sleazy telecast taunting things supernatural only once when yumi takes the zombie like mother in her arms did one missed call startle me a little br br one other point of interest renji ishibashi looks like christopher walken as the detective ishibashi in audition's abusive back story and as dead or alive's boss aoki of the vat of excrement drowning and more may be the most convincingly evil character actor i've ever seen so here he's a cop,0
bogdonovich's mostly unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other a film that has the feel of a fairy tale but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic manhattan locations and true geography perhaps the best location filming in nyc i've ever seen john ritter reminds us that with good directors bogdanovich blake edwards billy bob he can be brilliant and the entire ensemble is a group you'll wish truly existed so you could spend time with em one of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesn't seem to be a rip off of something else this is the high point of bogdanovich's fertile after success career when his best work was truly done saint jack at long last noises off,1
i should preface this by stating that i am a dolph lundgren fan the man turns out some of the funniest action clichés imaginable and detention is probably my personal favorite spoiler even though there is no such thing as a dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a harley with a sub machine gun through a high school hallway and the kid wins good game the oscar goes to detention dolph if you're reading this thanks for the laughs old friend br br in summary terrific movie that is a guaranteed laugh i recommend inviting some friends over for this and forcing them to sit through it hilarious,0
the premise of this anime series is about bread of all things to base a plot on i truly laughed the main character has a special bread making power that he was born with and he goes off to bread baking school i wish it were available on dvd and it doesn't matter if it's subtitled or dubbed it's that good even the theme song alone is funny at one point in the theme song there's an african japanese man with an afro on horseback wielding a french baguette as if it were a samurai sword these images will not make sense unless you see the anime you'll laugh until your sides hurt it is definitely the most unique anime i have seen thus far,1
there is nothing remotely scary about modern horror which is an insult to the word horror freddie vs jason the scream movies cabin trash and especially stephen king's infantile attempts he's recycled every story from the monkey's paw to whatever often in the same story at horror in both writing and on film except for kubrick's version of the shining which actually was scary unlike king's books which are as frightening as my big toe the left one which still has the nail br br but the woman in black is that rare modern film that will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end this is the way it should be done the director creates tension and the scariest ghost ever actually seen simply by having her suddenly turn up standing still somewhere or other with that incredible look on her face then he brings it all to a ghastly disturbing close he's learned his lessons from the masters who knew how to make horror val lewton original cat people and robert wise a val lewton disciple and director of the haunting and the body snatcher jacques tournier another val lewton disciple who directed a truly horrifying zombie film not the gross rubbish raimi did gross isn't scary folks it's just gross and lewis allen the uninvited and of course jack clayton's turn on henry james the innocents and the way the master of suspense hitchcock can still bring you to the edge of your seat even with a slow building and burning period piece like under capricorn br br ten stars,1
the group of people are travelling to belgrade in an awful bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son who likes to drive with his eyes closed their journey is frequently interrupted by many hilarious events which with much irony describe the fall of nation s spirit in 1941 and are so funny that they are even today used as a common jokes the man who steals the show is a peasant 4 feet tall with his 4 sons who are almost two times bigger than him in the end the movie takes one dramatical turn and the trip becomes nothing but a swan s song of a dying country,1
this movie is a true reflection of the australian resourcefulness that has been required to make this country what it is over the last 200 years not pompous like the british not gung ho like the americans if either of those countries had attempted what this crew did it would have failed dismally either due to ignorance on the british part or too much faith in superior firepower on the american side true australians i e non imports are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise most of their adult lives just look at examples like gallipoli paschendale tobruk new guinea and vietnam,1
without being one of my favorites this is good for being a change of pace even if only for a few minutes br br it all starts with a big fight between tom jerry and spike who is renamed butch here they're all beating each other but suddenly spike makes a heroic and admirable decision he stops the fight and suggests that they all should be friends so all of them sign a peace treaty and become friends which isn't going to last for long br br meanwhile the three become affectionate patient and kind to each other they even save each other when one of them is in danger of life the relationship goes nothing but excellent until a very big steak appears and they all become greedy the three are guilty to return to their usual fights and rivalries br br but still to see tom jerry and spike as friends is truly a delightful and grateful experience even if only for a while br br oh by the way as a curious fact two songs from the wizard of oz are played here in instrumental versions we're off to see the wizard and somewhere over the rainbow,1
heavily re edited and often confusing the original screen version of man on fire was at least ten years out of date when it was made and the passing years haven't made it any better this is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience make to get attention and everyone else does just to pay off their outstanding alimony or their drug dealer with scott glenn's bodyguard going out on a limb to rescue his 12 year old charge the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy italian family an interesting cast joe pesci brooke adams danny aiello jonathan pryce have all done better the action is sluggish and sparse and only john scott's exceptionally fine score part of which turned up in the last reel of die hard makes a positive impression one case where the remake made by tony scott the original choice of director for this version is an improvement,0
this foolish implausible tale is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a hard boiled police detective delivers some nearly audible lines confirming our greatest fears he is dead perhaps the film would have been saved had the director forgone the dazzling star power of a martinez in favor of this sadly anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment that a no name hack tor off the street could salvage such a dishwater film is no less likely than a villain committing murder by dropping stones into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver his moment is brief his promise is immense perhaps we will be treated to more screen time by this obscure thespian if there is ever a sequel to this ill advised film,0
this had to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen and i'm 64 years old and a football fan i went expecting to see a football movie about 10 minutes into it i began to wonder exactly how such a bad movie particularly the acting could have gotten into a theater about half way through i whispered to my husband that it was awful and he explained to me the facts behind the movie although i was a little offended and can see how some could be very offended if they were not christian at being preached to in a movie theater it wasn't that big a deal it was however a big deal to be subjected to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and above all the quality of the acting it is an appropriate movie for a church outing but to be shown in a church auditorium and not in a theater do i go to church yes do i want to go to church when i attend a movie no would i recommend this movie absolutely not,0
i really hate this show i had watched one episode and i knew this show is really terrible the story lines are both poorly written and executed and the jokes are really bad i mean it is just a sh ty rip off of dexter's laboratory and johnny quest 'bout an obnoxious boy with flamed blond hair with his twin genius sisters and talking dog a stay at home dad and a smart super busy mom like oh my flippin' god their dad is a mother f kin' crazy home maker isn't that so gay if my dad is a home maker i would personally die of shame that is really i would br br i have nothing else to about this this travesty but only 3 word count them 3 words to describe it br br · lame · stupid and above all · f k up that's all i could say folks it is definitely making my list of worst animated series ev er if i had one that is,0
this movie made me really mad because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent i've lived in iowa for 29 years and i know that people don't have a southern accent here this movie is about a guy who does meth and i don't know the real plot or what the movie is suppose to be about it has some pretty graphic drug use in it and it's really insulting so see these people use meth like it was sugar i lost my brother to meth and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because it glamorizes the drug the movie makes it look cool to use the drug but i was happy at the end when the guy almost made it across the state line i also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape don't want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day the movie is just wrong in all directions i would suggest the basketball diaries if i was going to suggest a movie about drugs,0
what an awful show science fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality it shocks me that something exceptional like firefly lasts one season while garbage like the battlestar galactica remake spawns a spin off this spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show the acting is juvenile and uninspired the characters are cardboard clichés of everything that has ever been in a bad sci fi series the story is bad the dialog is worse than a prime time soap opera the direction is shoddy and the sets are awful caprica is a waste of film a waste of time and a waste of effort this is one spin off that should have never been made,0
there was nothing about this movie that i liked it was so obviously low budget with bad lighting and camera work almost like blair witch project only it wasn't supposed to be that way there wasn't really much to the plot and the movie just drug on and on i actually fast forwarded through the last 1 3 of the movies but that did not help matters much it looked like it might be good from the box but i must say again nothing about this movie even resembled good no good actors the special effects were so fake the camera work was horrible and the dialogue was painfully terrible on my own personal scale i give this movie a 0 of 10 yikes,0
this horror movie is really weak that is if this is the correct movie i am commenting on nothing really terrible goes on as a family adopts a cute little german shepard pup i had a german shepard and it is a really good dog i did not get the idea to get one from this movie though but rather from the comedy k 9 that is another story all together though this movie really doesn't have much horror at all as the most horrific scene is at the end and it looks really cheesy also we see a guy almost put his hand into a lawn mower that is about it the father suspects something though as his family seems to be getting rather strange somewhere he finds out if you hold a mirror to them while they are sleeping you can see if they are possessed all in all a really weak horror movie even by television standards television movies that do work are out there as this house possessed is pretty good and there is another haunted house movie about a woman and these strange creatures that is also rather good this one is really rather dull,0
riding giants is an incredible documentary detailing the history and stories of three influential big wave surfers gregg noll jeff clark and laird hamilton stacy peralta did an amazing job taking on the role of director and should be congratulated for doing such a brilliant job the structure of the film is edited brilliantly and works perfectly with the narration interviews animation and surfing footage the music soundtrack just adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this film making riding giants brilliant viewing personal highlights include any of greg noll's comments what with his straight to the point frankness laird hamilton's footage at teahupoo and the out takes at the end of the movie but really this entire film is one big recommended highlight that comes highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see it's a shame it isn't more well known but it is a gem deserving of attention 10 10,1
alright so i've been dying to see this movie stoked about the who's who in horror land that are in the film well my friend rented this brought it over and we started watching it it's supposed to be a comedy i did not smirk even once until the 40min mark br br does it have to do with the budget not at all in fact there's films out there that cost close to absolutely nothing and they're amazing to me anyways also while watching this film i couldn't help but realize the similarities i e stealing to a low budget indie film titled actress apocalypse read my review about it it destroys this film btw br br this film it had potential it really did it had the star power stolen plot lets film the behind the scenes of the making of a movie ie actress apocalypse seriously this angers me the more and more i think about it really could've been funny a lot a lot of the jokes fall flat the acting is alright for what it is but it dragged on wasn't funny and the plot was totally stolen br br i give this a two because it wasn't sooo awful but that's the only reason,0
spoiler alert br br soooo arnie's really a good guy but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and some disobeying of orders he's sent to jail or rather some sort of work camp he escapes but after a short while he's caught once again this time ends up in a freakish reality show in which he's supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes and eventually die but we all know arnie and we all know that he's tougher than even the toughest of tough guys br br i really wanted to like this movie being an arnie fan and all however the running man contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me e g the reconstruction of arnie's fight inside the helicopter where the shocked audience is showed a short summary of the incident complete with 5 10 different camera angles this means that the military helicopter in which arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras filming the crew members one of which inside the eye of one of the crew members arnie beats br br there are other flaws also and the plot which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative works for a while then it sort of creates a pool of stupidness and unrealism in which it drowns br br the acting can't really be said to be anything better than sub par with arnie in the leading role doing an average arnie performance the rest of the cast get by without being especially good or bad br br the special effects are ok without being impressive br br rating 3 10,0
bromwell high is nothing short of brilliant expertly scripted and perfectly delivered this searing parody of a students and teachers at a south london public school leaves you literally rolling with laughter it's vulgar provocative witty and sharp the characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of british society or to be more accurate of any society following the escapades of keisha latrina and natella our three protagonists for want of a better term the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject political correctness flies out the window in every episode if you enjoy shows that aren't afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable then bromwell high will not disappoint,1
this might contain a spoiler so beware br br if it had been 200 000 thousand or two million people does it make a difference sometimes i get so angry at the apparent apathy of a small number of strangely very loud americans but i have to remember that many people here in the us were not bred or raised to care about anything outside of their comfort zone god help us for what we have done after the relative ease of what we did to the native americans and the indifference to the horrors of enslaving a race you would think we'd have grown hearts and souls in the late 60's and early 70's but now i see it is ok as long as our ends are justified to only us how then can we look at any other dictator and horrible government and think we are somehow doing good to impose our will we are contradictory and hypocritical and i am ashamed for this i feel sorrow for the people affected they deserve justice and their homes back if this was done in my name as an american for my supposed safety i don't want it i denounce these actions and hope our global community understands that many americans believe the american government is a runaway train of deceit no one is above the law i want my country back and so do the chagos islanders regardless of what people post from the anonymity of their computers no one can in their heart deny that they would be unwilling to give up their birthplace for some bombs and heliports we can't stand to be stuck in traffic let alone forcibly and unjustly removed from our homes 'not one of us brit and american alike forget what goes around comes around don't buy into the fallacy that a simpler more natural civilization is somehow less worthy of having their rights observed and preserved when we turn our backs on the basic human rights and dignities of 2000 we turn away from the basic human rights and dignities of all men,1
this would have to be one of the funniest tv sitcoms to come out of the states since the demise of everybody loves raymond warburton is always hilarious and in this complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection david spade continues to tickle my funny bone enormously with his quite unique delivery of his lines after having raved over the british series coupling i can see from just where the creators of rules of engagement got their original idea but this is not intended as being a brickbat the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart but it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series particularly in the very difficult field of comedy having been a part of a professional tv comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in australia i can appreciate particularly the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew one of the few grievances i have with the series is the very obviously canned laughter surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series,1
michael caine has always claimed that ashanti was the only film he did purely for the money as well as the worst film he ever starred in hold on michael weren't you in the swarm and hurry sundown and weren't both of those films a good deal worse than ashanti perhaps caine remembers only too begrudgingly the physically punishing demands of filming an action film in searing 130 degrees fahrenheit temperatures the director richard fleischer was hospitalised as a result of sun stroke during the shoot what ashanti actually emerges as is not the career low point of michael caine instead it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast exotic locations boring stretches and a highly formulaic storyline br br dr david linderby caine is a w h o medic who is left devastated when his black wife anansa beverly johnson goes missing during an aid trip to an african tribal village linderby gradually realises that his wife has been snatched by slave traders led by suleiman peter ustinov and he sets off on a continent wide pursuit which eventually leads to the middle east br br along the way big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles william holden has a poor cameo as a chopper pilot omar sharif displays little of his customary charm or grace as a pampered arab millionaire rex harrison looks rightfully bored during his brief role as a helpful contact who assists caine in his quest the film is based on a best seller entitled ebano by the little known author alberto vasquez figueroa but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation ustinov is charismatic as the slaver he seems in all his movies to be incapable of giving bad performances and caine generates believable anguish as the man who thinks he'll never see his wife again there are occasional flashes of action but on the whole ashanti is quite slow moving all in all it is a resistible piece of action hokum not by any stretch as awful as caine has frequently suggested but not a very inspiring film and certainly a let down from all the talent involved,0

when i was six yo i learned about a series called los campeones and even if i was just a kid i did everything i need to convince my parents to let me watch the champions and the avengers once every week i think that was the golden age of english series i already own the complete cycle of the prisoner but lasted also a few years later with the tomorrow people the worst witch i just me or this is harry potter in girl of course before as much as i want the campions to be in zone 1 or zone 4 i'm also waiting for dr who pack the whole series in a set of uhm maybe 300 dvd's please i couldn't expend more for it 8 people of tomorrow and several other 'low budget' but great stories to be available within my reached zones i speak and understand english but not all my relatives do including my parents whom introduced me into these great stories i hope someday someone could feel the attraction of these series and then could sell them as i originally view them dubbed or subtitled but in the same format i saw them remember zone 1 or 4 are ok with my tv set,1
stereotypical send up of slasher flicks falls far short as supposed entertainment gerrit graham michael lerner zane busby and in fact the entire cast are totally wasted lame jokes abound and every punch line is well telegraphed the dumb one liners come at a fast pace and almost every one falls flat as a squashed grape the musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and lingers for the entire movie another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school avoid this and seek out one of lampoon's truly funny films like national lampoon's golddiggers merk,0
cynthia rothrock china o'brien manhattan chase 2000 made this film enjoyable to watch and of course e this cute petite gal burned up the screen with her artistic abilities and hot sexy body china o'brien gets upset as a police officer and decides to call it quits and go back home to her hometown and get back to her roots and her dad who is the local sheriff her dad is getting older and the town has changed gangsters have taken over the town and started to get the local women to start turning tricks and the city people were getting sick and tired of their town going to hell well you almost can guess what happens and you are right china o'brien fights back after great tragedy strikes her life bad acting through out the picture but cynthia rothrock brings this film to a wonderful conclusion,0
when i saw the preview i thought this is going to be a great movie and indeed it could have been the actress playing the main character was very credible and the beauty of the filming is undeniable however the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture the level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in 1610 and it took away most of the magic of the film however i must congratulate the translator because the english sub titles were more refined and appropriate that the original french cues and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd,0
julia ross nina foch agrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family's estate in cornwall when she awakens they keep telling her she's marion hughes has been mentally ill and keep her locked up but why you'll probably guess why but won't mind because this one is fun br br along with the narrow margin and face behind the mask this is one of the best b pictures ever made b pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars it's just as long as it needs to be only 65 minutes is well directed fast paced and exciting it only stumbles at the end which i found a bit too implausible to buy br br foch a good actress is just ok in the lead but dame may witty is great and george macready is excellent and frightening as the villains well worth catching a perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget,1
this is a movie of tired yet weirdly childish clichés there's a nazi witch master performing sf related experiments in the basement oh please br br aiming for a creeping sense of horror and fear the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright not having any expectations beforehand i am left with an aged xander from buffy and a heroine with ape like face who doesn't seem to know how to act said adrienne barbeau have i only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death br br camera and editing adds to the general impression of lame,0
i had the privilege of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago and outside the theater i was confronted by a camera crew from a local tv station looking for comments on the film at the time the only words that escaped my mouth were awesome just awesome i like to think i can articulate myself a little better than that but at the time i was somewhat incapable of doing so br br the story is intriguing and thought provoking and the acting is first rate from all the principals this film was the first one that terry gilliam directed that he didn't have a hand in the writing credit for back with universal after his long arduous battle with them over brazil terry had achieved what he wanted most the final cut terry is a master craftsman and each shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been constructed carefully with determination and conviction it is only justice that such an individual should be unfettered in his attempts to convey a concept unfortunately limitations still exist in such arrangements br br the universal collector's edition dvd of this film is simply amazing although most of the bonus features aren't listed on the box it contains among other things a director producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90 minute documentary on the making of the film called the hamster factor and other tales of 12 monkeys it tells of some of the creative pitfalls in filmmaking including a test of mettle when preview screenings tested poorly striking the team with feelings of self doubt and despair fortunately for all of us they decided to change very little about the film and released it to an enormous success br br,1
what i liked best in this film is that like the films of hitchcock it is a thriller that does not take itself too seriously br br hitchcock understood that people go the the movies to have a good time something that hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years this is a thriller but it has plenty of laughs and always has one eye winking at the camera br br rachel mcadams is wonderful as always cillian murphy is creepier than he was in batman begins in the old days there were guys who always played the bad guy we don't see much of that these days because i suspect the hollywood agents consider it a bad career move but cillian murphy is really good at being bad br br the directing is surprising stylish the story is good but the dialog could have used some sprucing up br br red eye is a really fun film and people were applauding when the closing credits started rolling if you are in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller red eye might be your ticket,1
best of the zorro serials and one of my favorite serials period this is a period serial set right after the birth of mexico the new nation is counting on the gold produced by this one town to keep the republic solvent however a gold god don del oro is stirring up the indians and stealing the gold for himself its zorro and his band of men to the rescue reed hadley is a winning zorro and he cuts a dashing figure as he gets into a nice selection of scraps most all of which were reused by the later zorro serials as well as other serials as well the story moves and its nicely not clear who the real bad guy is there is a reason that i've seen this the most of any serial i've seen its simply a great action adventure film the only thing i can compare it to is the mark of zorro with tyrone power or one of the other swashbucklers of the period its super and highly recommended,1
the cast is different and now they took a different approach we have the street smart team networth vs the supposed professional team magna but boy if you think the street smart team would have trouble you'd be right while the magna team has struggled at times the street team has simply disintegrated week after week br br first some things to reiterate as far as the apprentice 3 first of it continues the same absurd mentality from trump and the game in this series if your a good project manager but you lose the team will turn on you and you will be fired despite the fact that your backstabbing teammates are often the ones who do half ass jobs simply absurd that a game show that claims to hire the best candidate actually weeds out the best while the dysfunctional candidates stab each other until one is left and that person is the best lol br br anyone this season weve seen a total of cursing backstabbing and even gay offensive stereotypes carried out as teams try to do campaigns br br the list of victims so far cast tara dowdell audrey evans danny kastner those three are the only that i feel were unfairly fired by trump the rest really had it coming as they only incited conflict anger and suffering it's just amazing as one candidate audrey evans said as how she who did a good job was fired and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game br br yes its the game it's the apprentice where manipulation backstabbing and always popular everyone gang up on the project manager mentality rules br br it has been an entertaining ride though the candidates are given a wide array of assignments from photo shoots to the construction of mini golf courses to building of new apartments br br still though it's still the apprentice though so all you can do basically is laugh the whole time as the insanity and chaos insues until lucky person is the winner,1
i was one of about 200 people that was lucky enough to see an early sneak of this film br br stardust follows tristan a young man on a quest to find a fallen star and bring it back to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her the only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall a doorway between england and a magical kingdom known as stormhold br br this film was just a joy to watch it has something in it for everyone all of the action scenes are played out beautifully and the comedy is spread out through the film making it funny without being corny if i had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be the princess bride a classic br br all the performances are outstanding the beautiful claire danes makes you love her in her portrayal of yvaine the trusting naive star and under rated michelle pfeiffer delivers a stellar over the top performance as larnia but the performance to talk about is robert de niro in every scene that he is in hands down he steals the show br br if you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film guys don't get turned off by the description there is enough action comedy and not to mention lots of eye candy with claire danes and michelle pfeiffer to keep you entertained throughout the cinematography is dead on and keeps with the feel of the film nothing about the film seems forced,1
i was pleased to see that she had black hair i've been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the stories br br i was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer it didn't spoil it at all in fact i watched the film twice in one day a sure sign that it was up to standard this is what i do with books that i like as well br br i thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of modesty blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip i would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly has he actually read the books br br i thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation,1
the idea was awesome the actors were incredible the story could of been very scary but the writing was poor and there was no depth i couldn't really get into this movie i couldn't feel for the characters there were a lot of cliffhangers and the movie just ends very weirdly was it a happy ending i don't know was it a sad ending again i don't know you leave the theater feeling unsatisfied the movie had so much to give but couldn't just because you can edit doesn't mean you should right i wouldn't really recommend this movie because you just can't say that you left the movie feeling like it was completed you'll just be confused trust me you will probably thank me if you don't watch this movie br br 3 10,0
the fact that i did not like the music is a very personal opinion the historical innacuracies are not i do realize that it is an opera and not a documentary but some important aspects are missing especiallly if other people comment falsely because of it br br abbu abas was the mastermind of this operation which was staged and reorganized due to discovery on board the shiph in order to free 50 terrorists from israeli prisons one of which was samir kuntar a heinous terrorist whose story you can find by searching for klinghoffer samir kuntar on google abbu abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations even if he never set foot on the achile lauro ben laden never set foot on the planes that hit the wtc did he br br possible spoilers br br the movie almost excuses the terrorists' actions and reactions because of horrors they might have lived always accentuating and exaggerating how much the israeli's have done to hurt them however they never portray the hurt that the palestinians have ever caused to the israelis the movie uses quite horrid images from the sabra and chatila horror and nothing is said understating the general belief that it was israel who was responsible without ever mentioning that it was a syrian les lebanese army who conducted the massacre br br the acting was generally very bad but i guess that's what can be expected from opera singers br br on another note i am shocked at how a person can excuse terrorists killing a hostage because the hostage tried to stir the 400 innocent hostages against the armed terrorists and add that the person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of zionism imagine how unsympathetic his wife was spitting on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea i hope no one in the world is as cruel as she is wink wink,0
this is a low budget roger corman horror creature flick a dinocroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok an engineered croc first kills one of its own then gets the taste of human and becomes a fast growing terror after escaping none of the characters have any depth but then they are not the focal point we only get a few glimpses of the huge two legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best kill scenes in a small budget film br br my favorite scene is of a moronic character trying to use a three legged dog for bait and becomes croc food himself nothing left on the pier but ankle top feet with no real stand out roles jane longendecker bruce weitz and charles napier most pathetic is matt borlenghi and an obnoxious professional croc hunter costas mandylor i was most impressed with the alluring joanna pacula as the respectfully feared dr p dinocroc is redeeming as a crock of pickles,0
i must have been only 11 when mr peepers started it was a must see for the whole family i believe on sun nights repeating gags were rob opening his locker he had to use a yardstick or pointer to gage the right spot on another locker and do some other things finally kicking the spot whereupon his door would open and taking pins out of a new shirt at the start of an episode he would open up a package with a new dress shirt and for the rest of the show be finding one pin after another that he missed when unwrapping the shirt timing was everything and the pins got lots of laughs i remember an aunt that drove a rio like jack benny and always wanted sonny to say something scientific he would think and come up with semi permeable membrane or osmosis causing her to say how brilliant he was you had to have been there marion lorne stole the show every time she was on screen why they didn't continue the series from her pov when wally quit he was afraid he was being typecast but by then it was way too late i'll never know i saw somewhere that the 1st tv wedding big one anyway was tiny tim on the carson show horsecocky it was rob and nancy did i ever have the hots for her and i remember it made the cover of tv guide and got press in all the papers and major magazines a trip to the museum of broadcasting in nyc years ago was disappointing in that they had very few episodes then and those might be gone now i still remember it as wonderful and wish i had been a little older,1
guy kibbee gives the viewer a lot of laughs like most candidates he knows almost nothing warren william a very under rated actor is superb in giving instructions to kibbee that is he teaches him to say something which means nothing to the voting public a campaign based on no comment i'll take it under advisement and maybe yes but then again maybe no is the nearly perfect way to win an election succinctly the dumber the candidate the greater the chance he or she will win after all the public can identify with such a person with respect to the movie it makes for a lot of comedy,1
personally i think this show looks pretty cheaply made some of the actors are terrible they over do it seem fake i can always tell how it's going to end within the first 10 minutes or less of watching because they make it so transparently clear it's not very well written either i love to watch it to laugh at it you know the saying it's so bad that it's good well that saying applies to this show i also like to watch just to see if i'm right when i guess how it's all going to end so far i've been right every time it's like a little game that i play it's nice when you are bored you feel like laughing at something,0
i found this very touching as spike and heaton stay together all the way through this film not to say there isn't a few betrayals along the way i thought the chase was put aside the relationship between the two was foreground i think i had already guessed that there were so gay intentions on the part of heaton my favourite scene had to be the bit where heaton and spike were stuck in the marsh and spike runs off i generally thought spike wasn't coming back i have to say that if it wasn't for our film studies teacher making us watch this i would have probably never seen it overall i thought this film was pretty good and i would recommend it to any person who is a fan of british made films,1
et's obsession with dannielynn smith is despicable leave the child alone with all the constant attention she'll most likely grow up psychotic depressed or worse think of princess diana and how she longed for privacy now poor little rich girl ashley olson just wants to be left alone no wonder greta garbo became a recluse and said i want to be alone how much does et make off this little girl does et not have anything better to report on i bet there's lots of people who really don't care what color her birthday cake and balloons were by the way i never heard that anna nichole ever won any of those court cases over the will and her inheritance who is paying for the lifestyle of larry howard and little dannielynn could it be et,0
not as bad as some are making it out to be though obviously pathetic compared to the original in my opinion amitabh was great as the villain babban singh try not to compare to gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect other than some mediocre action scenes however the rest of the film is flawed character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless with many loopholes and missing pieces of information which i wouldn't have known if i hadn't read the back of the dvd case the worst part of the movie was the support roles from nisha kothari and especially this new dude called prashant raj nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open as for prashant raj seriously who is this guy where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks his acting ability is zero and he has the same tone dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene whether it be action comedy or even a scene when someone has just died ajay devgan was average at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion overall rgv's aag is worth watching for amitabh's solid performance and also a very sexy urmilla matondkar in a special appearance,0
good actors and good performances can't mask a pointless script bad dialogue and patterns of behavior spiraling into nothing you'd care about the most interesting character is david berkowitz no character development no growth no interest just some suffering for no particular reason teaching us nothing and not even bothering to entertain,0
i loathed this film the original phantasm had such wonderful ambiance and mystery like many 70s horror flicks it looked and felt like some creepy unfinished documentary phantasm ii from the late 80s pumped up the action but maintained this nice attention to mood sadly phantasm iii is just awful it tediously explains all of the weird happenings in the previous films which diminishes rather than expands their power it shamelessly degrades imagery from the first phantasm like a cheap reenactment of the original there are so many flying spheres in this movie that they seem more like household pests than menacing death orbs hundreds hang from the ceiling like christmas balls swaying in the draft didn't anyone the prop master the dp the editor the director notice or care that they looked so crummy even worse phantasm iii presents one corny unfunny joke after another how different from the intensity of the first film the original phantasm used humor to relieve its relentless focus on death phantasm iii uses death to set up countless cheap jokes about reggie's horniness several refer to the film's flying balls ha ha oh i get it balls maybe the crew got a kick out of these jokes but they are on us,0
i guess i only have myself to blame for the gigantic disillusion that is entrails of a virgin you already know not to expect a cinematic masterpiece when you see a juicy and proudly promoted title like this and the first impression only gets extra confirmed when noticing the film is a mid 80's production from japan now there are quite a lot of demented and sick filmmakers active in japan but kazuo komizu surpasses them all with his thoroughly depraved and sickening trilogy revolving on nothing but aggressive sex and the sadistic abuse of young girls not even attempting to tell a story entrails of a virgin simply presents a hodgepodge of un arousing semi pornographic sex and truly poor gore effects that wouldn't even please the most undemanding fan of cheesy 80's horror images of a bunch of photographers and their fashion models are inexplicably intercut with scenes of a filthy pervert having crude sex with a seemly under aged girl he dumps her not even a minute after climaxing typical and she begs him to stay even if she has to share him with other women i don't get it is this supposed to represent a general male fantasy because it's really clichéd and wrongful anyways back to the bunch of horny photographers and docile models surprised by upcoming fog on their way home the group entrenches themselves in an abandoned country house where they have more appalling sex and eventually fall victim to a ridiculous sex demon who kills them all the acting performances are amateurish the dialogs inane and primitive and komizu's direction is weak and uninspired i can tolerate all that including the woman unfriendly portrayal of sex but i came too close to turning the film off during the indescribably mean spirited wrestling sequence one of the males brutally hits kicks and throws around one of the girls and calls her a filthy whore until she literally pees her panties and cries with agony this sequence is in my humble opinion the absolute low point of asian exploitation cinema one to avoid and maybe even boycott,0
after her oscar nominated turn in secrets lies brenda blethyn starred in the equally great saving grace and let me tell you this is not the sort of movie that you find every day br br after her husband commits suicide grace trevethyn brenda blethyn discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt fortunately she finds a way to make ends meet marijuana that's right grace starts cultivating it br br every aspect of this movie was played to great effect there isn't a dull moment anywhere in it and i sure didn't see that end scene coming but anyway you gotta see this movie you just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it if nothing else it might function as a good lesson about knowing one's finances but of course there's a lot more to it than that,1

richard brooks excellent 1967 film of truman capote's novel in cold blood is a perfect companion piece to philip seymour hoffman's oscar winning performance in the 2005 capote they really play well together try them on separate nights it is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well these two truly enhance each other even though different actors play the roles of killers perry smith and dick hickock the two pieces blend well only the part of the writer played by paul stewart in the brooks films is weaker as they give him a different name then capote i'd suggest watching capote first followed by in cold blood it makes for a powerful experience,1
if any style of film could be called my guilty pleasure it'd be this generic fantasy type guilty is the wrong word for it though as i'm pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time stardust is good stock fantasy the likes of which one should expect from neil gaiman or gaiman adaptation as it were it isn't the visual dream scape of mirrormask it isn't the adult pretension of pan's labyrinth and it isn't the fun loving classic the princess bride but it contains just what the fantasy lover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing fantasy lovers should rejoice special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now br br the story of stardust involves a young man named tristan who in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of wall goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star to make things difficult however tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named yvaine and he's not the only one looking for her some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star's heart can give and a brother's feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction br br from there it's all pretty predictable but it involves some attractive fantasy elements some warm hearted commentary on the nature of love and the best part robert deniro as a gay pirate on that note deniro's performance is spot on it's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough and gruff typecast character thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching deniro's own opening up into alternate forms of acting deniro hasn't been so unique to his own image since brazil and that's saying something br br stardust is the type of movie perhaps that will subsist on children's and fantasy lover's shelves for a long time i can't say it offers anything new but it's not really there to it's actually those most familiar with it's tropes that will enjoy it the most br br polarisdib,1
i loved the way earth is made its photography is unbelievable editing it must have been an interesting challenge and patrick stewart's voice over is perfect in addition its music and sound editing make watching earth a profound experience you don't want to miss you really are on a journey to where you would probably never ever end up by yourself br br and although at first i was quite surprised by the laughter of the audience as we see animals in their daily fight for survival i could not help laughing myself sometimes nature simply seems too impressive to comprehend br br but rather than the need to laugh i left the cinema with a profound question howcome 200 years of industrial revolution can destroy natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years br br with this question in mind you'll understand how i felt somewhat bitter and powerless after seeing earth i felt the immediate need to change the world to help all these animals in their struggle to undo the changes we have gone through the last centuries and to stop the global heating at once all that not being a ngo activist at all br br so i immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the film to see what i could do to save our still fantastic planet and the polar bear from its depressing fate www loveearth com br br i was a little disappointed to find no direct answers to my questions there yet it was very interesting to find out more about the film and the struggle its crew went through br br i hope that cutting on my energy use will do i don't know how else to shorten the distance polar bears have to swim to reach land before they drown or attack animals they cannot beat in their exhausted state br br an inspiring film it is but i didn't leave the cinema feeling very happy,1
i'm into bad movies but this has nothing going for it despite what the morons above have said it is not funny i know comedy and underground movies but this is so boring that the director writer should be prohibited from ever directing anything but local cable access ever again to love movies and comedy is to despise this film i may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was if you like this movie you are a pothead as sober there is nothing here zero if you need to compare underground movies see kentucky fried movie or early john waters the movie starts by defining satire and i defy anyone to show me the satire the rule for comedy is this if it's funny you can say or do anything but if it's not funny you are not satirical you are not edgy you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny zero,0
really bad movie the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complement br br this vampire's hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far derek bliss jon bon jovi travels to mexico in search for some blood suckers he use some interesting weapons but nothing compared to blade and is part of some van helsig vampire's hunters net ok but he work alone he's assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight is almost a sequel of vampires 1998 directed by john carpenter and starred by james woods derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends sancho diego luna really bad acting also a teenager without experience father rodrigo cristian de la fuente a catholic priest zoey natasha wagner a particular vampire and ray collins darius mccrary another expert vampire hunter so obviously in this adventure he isn't alone br br you can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor jon bon jovi is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to james woods and then if you watch the film i don't recommend this part you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories totally predictable with terrible acting performances really bad special effects and incoherent events br br i deeply recommend not to see this film rent another movie see another channel go out with your friends etc br br 3 10,0
a man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 50's and that he now has the power to burst into flames br br i was really geared up for this film what with being directed by the great toby hooper and staring wild card brad dourif unfortunately it didn't rise above the average individual with violent powers movie spontaneous combustion has an interesting premise behind it unfortunately it never seems to live up to its potential and prolongs its plot too much the special effects aren't bad though and help to carry the movie to the finale br br the cast isn't bad dourif does steal the show br br all around no classic but it's not the worst of its kind either br br out of,0
penn takes the time to develop his characters and we almost care about them however there are some real problems with the story here we see no real motivation for the evil brother's behavior and the time line is screwed up supposedly set in 1963 the music is late 60s early 70s the references and dialogue is 70s 80s the potential for a powerful climax presents itself and penn allows it to slip away but even with all these difficulties it is worth the watch but not great,0
i remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1982 loved it then about 4 years later i had the privilege of seeing luciano pavarotti sing at the metropolitan opera house in new york in tosca so seeing the ending of this film reminds me very much of that great night what's not to like about this film the music is brilliant and pavarotti fini was at his best and still looked great the story is actually very funny in parts the 'food fight' scene is still one of the funniest i have ever seen the hot air balloon flight over the napa valley was beautiful so was the song he sang if we were in love one of the few times pavarotti sang in english and hearing the duet of santa lucia gorgeous get real folks this was a film about an opera singer called georgio fini who just happened to be played by pavarotti kathryn harrold eddie albert were excellent in their supporting roles br br i am very glad that i still have this almost worn out vhs tape of this movie but i would love this to be released on dvd especially now that pavarotti is no longer with us because i think this includes the best performance of nessun dorma sung by him still on film today,1
how this film gains a 6 7 rating is beyond belief it deserves nothing better than a 2 0 and clearly should rank among imdb's worst 100 films of all time national treasure is an affront to the national intelligence and just yet another assault made on american audiences by hollywood critics told of plot holes you could drive a 16 wheeler through br br i love the justifications for this movie being good nicholas cage is cute come on people no wonder people around the world think americans are stupid this has to be the most stupid insulting movie i have ever seen if you wanted to see an actually decent film this season consider kinsey the woodsman million dollar baby or sideways national treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific films i bet most of you reading this haven't even heard of them since some haven't been widely released yet br br nicholas cage is a terrific actor when he is in the right movies time after time i've seen cage waste his terrific talent in awful mind numbing films like con air the rock and face off when his talent is put to good use like in charlie kaufman's adaptation he is an incredible actor br br bottom line i'd rather feed my hand to a wood chipper than be subjected to this visual atrocity again,0
bullfighter was made in 2000 but it is being released on video 5 years later for some reason i wonder why could it be the confusing storyline the incomprehensible dialogue said by oliver martinez and the annoying editing it's got to be i think the plot was mary michelle forbes and jacque oliver martinez go on a mystical road trip they meet a lot of wacky characters and avoid some evil ones too the movie looks great and there is a lot of style but there is no substance most movies when trying to subtle don't call attention to themselves with unanswered plot developments and weak special effects br br don't be fooled by the cover willem dafoe is in it for 2 minutes at most,0
i enjoyed the movie very much emotionally intellectually and visually it contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects and doesn't need them one bit holding my attention the entire time with the visuals story and interspersed words of wisdom br br however 1 some of the foreign language accents made the dialog difficult to hear understand 2 there is unnecessary overuse of swearing especially the f word which is the only reason this movie was rated r 3 the movie is balanced with humor and emotion but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film except the final resolution last minutes is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to loss living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long 4 i will not recommend this movie because of 5 seconds of background narration which did not add one bit to the side character it applied to or the film it only turned me off to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterward the main character's mother of german ancestry when watching old wwii movies secretly roots for the germans there would be no local color or art if the nazi's won the war i don't know of any germans today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the nazi's won wwii,0
this film was quite a surprise i wasn't expecting much to be honest greta garbo's first hollywood film so what probably something rough and with the usual exaggerated arm waving and facial contortions that low grade silent films so often show br br well was i mistaken greta garbo must have just shocked the studio people as much as she did me because this film made her a star and deservedly so she instinctively understood the power of just standing still or of simply holding a meaningful expression for a long lingering moment so its effect could be felt and not just seen i kept thinking to myself how did this modern actress get into a creaky silent film she was just years and years ahead of her time br br the story isn't all that interesting it is the usual tale of love found and lost it is only the performance of garbo as leonora the poor village girl who makes good in the big city and then returns to get the man who got away that gives it life co star ricardo cortez is serviceable but his character is never really developed and he is demeaned by the script throughout at one point he is made to wear garbo's clothes leave in a huff then ignominiously return and give them back and let's not even talk about his horrible final scenes with garbo and then his wife way too ordinary he didn't have much of a career after this and i can understand why but he suffices as the somewhat mystifying object of leonora's obsession br br there is one utterly fantastic line in this film that just says it all leonora you are becoming conspicuous yes conspicuous indeed br br if you really want to know what it's all about without seeing the whole film just watch the last 30 seconds or so garbo's glance as she sits quite alone in her luxurious car says everything she must be so happy she has everything she wants yes garbo's face says it all about that i have to see this one again garbo is just amazing,1
a group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick up truck mirage is obviously inspired by spielberg's duel and craven's the hills have eyes still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore the film's gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck there is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk and slash sequences the acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak but the film is fast paced and shocking b g steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening the desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong overall if you like low budget horror films give this one a look 8 out of 10,1
to compare this squalor with an old low budget porno flick would be an insult to the old low budget porno flick the animal scenes have no meaning nor do they represent this man and his crimes even in the broadest sense of abstractions the synopsis on the back of the dvd case says in part gripping retelling of the btk killer's reign of terror this is not a retelling a retelling would suggest that you are being told the truth of what happened or how or why none of these things are true i'm an enthusiastic studier of serial killers and have seen some pretty crappy movies about them and honestly this is not one of them this isn't even about the btk killer save yourself some time and a few bucks and rent dahmer instead that serial killer movie is accurate and true however if you just have to see this movie for yourself check it out for free at your local library and even then you'll still feel cheated,0
not one of the better pokemon movies br br two legendary pokemon come into the story you do get to see how strong celebi can be though he turns evil first br br suicune also makes an appearance he didn't seem that powerful br br the marauder didn't have many strong pokemon at all except for that taranitar some fight scenes with his pokemon may have made it better br br ash and pikachu meet the much younger professor oak though they don't realise it misty i was thinking had it at the end but she didn't get close i saw this in the credits br br don't expect much here the worst of the series so far,0
i thought this movie was really really great because in india cinemas nowadays all you see is skin music and bad acting in this movie you can see some tradition ethnicity and at least some decency although some parts were a little dramatic guess what that is what indian cinema is all about after watching this movie at least you don't get a headache from all the loud overrated music or any violence its just the truth it teaches about love and of course caring for the person you love throughout life i think it was an amazing movie kids can watch it without a doubt and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be india's sure profoundness until all these rap hits miniskirts and skin showing became a part of it,1
you know the rest if you want a good zombie movie don't rent this movie if you want a documentary esquire look at hood life you're at the wrong place as well if you're looking for a laughable piece of film this is a real winner the acting is as flat as a piece of paper the best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive by i can tell that he did the voice for the 911 operator as well by the flat tone of his voice if i could hear a cardboard box talk it'd probably sound like this guy oh yea and the zombies did their best snake impression which is on par with their fantastic acting overall note sarcasm how did this not win an oscar for best make up the quiroz did not do any sort of directing i felt like i was watching an improvisational period piece the period is more like 1990's la the direction is however one uped by the worst script i think to ever grace a movie i haven't heard such lovely lines like the epic one word beginning to the movie f k since ice grill which was another urban thriller this only works of course in conjunction with the also epic hip hop soundtrack all 3 or so songs of it all in all what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled hood of the living dead i rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene and boy it delivered and more i would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror yea right movie for the night a memorable experience for sure,0
boring predictable by the numbers horror outing at least has pretty good special effects and plenty of mindless mayhem and gore to satisfy mindless genre fans mostly it's about giant rats chomping on a set of characters we don't care an iota about if that's your thing tune in 1 2,0
this 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writer director steve gordon and stars dudley moore and john gielgud sadly gordon only in his early forties died soon after completing this his only feature film it's an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at character driven farce that makes the whole film irresistible it plays almost like a 1930's style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes the plot centers on arthur bach a drunken diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his 750 million inheritance if he doesn't marry the dowdy and boring susan johnson an heiress handpicked by his old money father and dotty grandmother of course he doesn't love her and by chance runs into linda marolla a working class waitress and of course aspiring actress after she pilfers a bergdorf goodman tie for her father br br the standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol fueled slapstick executed with classic élan by moore that he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to gielgud's feisty acidic turn as hobson arthur's devoted but reality grounded valet it's the type of role he could play in his sleep but gielgud makes hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings in probably her most likable film role liza minnelli hands the picture to her male co stars by toning down her usual razzle dazzle personality and making linda quite genuine in motivation br br a pre la law jill eikenberry plays susan just at the right passive aggressive note while barney martin jerry's dad on seinfeld steals all his scenes as linda's slovenly father ralph the one fly in the ointment is veteran actress geraldine fitzgerald who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother and i have to admit that i still can't stand the very dated overplayed christopher cross song that inevitably won the oscar for that year's best song unfortunately the 1997 dvd certainly in need of remastering has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes,1
this is a film that on the surface would seem to be all about j edgar hoover giving himself a a big pat on the back for fighting klansmen going after indian killers hunting the famous gangsters of the 1930's fighting nazi's in the us and south america during world war 2 and commies in new york during the early 1950's of course in 1959 we did not know about mr hoover's obsession for keeping secret files on honest americans bugging people like the rev martin luther king jr but worst of all his secret love affair with his deputy director clyde tolson if you want to know more about that subject i suggest seeing the film citizen cohn hoover aside this story of a life in the fbi as told by jimmy stewart makes for a decent but dated film vera miles as his devoted wife is also good but jimmy is the movie as much as hoover controlled production and always made sure the fbi was seen without fault jimmy stewart gave the film a human side quite an achievement considering hoover was always looking over his shoulder the background score is also pleasant i have read recent online articles suggesting that this is a forgotten film jimmy stewart was one of the greatest film stars of all time and none of his films should be forgotten tcm was the last network to show it a long time ago and i hope they show it again,1
the cliché of the shell shocked soldier home from the war is here given dull treatment pity a splendid cast acting to the limits of their high talents can't redeem 'the return of the soldier' from its stiff collared inability to move the viewer to emotional involvement best moments as another reviewer noted come when glenda jackson is on screen but even jackson's crackling good cinematic power can't pull this film's chestnuts from its cold never warmed hearth ann margret she of sex kitten repute and too often accused of lacking acting ability finds her actual and rather profound abilities wasted here despite her speaking with a nigh flawless middlesex accent the hackneyed score redolent of many lackluster tv miniseries' slathered on saccharine emotionalism is at irritating odds with the emotional remoteness of the script blocking and overbaked formalism of the direction except for its score and corseted script and direction 'the return of the soldier' has all the right bits but it fails to make them work together,0
although this is better than the first mulva which doesn't say much anyways i would rather watch paint dry it still sucks do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these low budget pictures guys i was suckered into buying a few dvds to support some indy filmmakers and boy did i regret it some haven't even been officially released yet not bootlegs bought from the filmmakers themselves and i can't even list how bad they all are avoid anything with teen ape or bonejack in them as they do pop up in other small indy films that they are friends with if you are friends of these guys chances are you were in their movies and had fun making them but for those that had to watch them no way bad video bad audio bad acting bad plot etc etc these aren't even funny i gave this one a 2 only because debbie rochon is in it and that is about it maybe it doesn't even deserve the 2 about a 1 1 16th star to show it was slightly better than the first which i wish i could have rated in the negatives if you want a decent no budget film go pick up something from lbp's friends over at freak productions like marty jenkins or even raising the stakes those are actually decent,0
this movie was well done in all respects the acting is superb along with the fine audio soundtrack which i purchased because it was so moving it is my all time favorite movie ahead of eastwoods white hunter black heart this movie is simply the best br br cheers zuf,1
this is a case of a bunch of people thinking they are so clever they have a story that fits the time remember the all around political conspiracies caught on camera in the years leading to the watergate and a little later most movies trying to cash in on made for tv 'o so powerful o so mind numbing' conspiracies were in fact caught in their own navel gazing attitude br br i was never a fan of the conversation which i find as much dated as others conspiracy stints of the time but coppola was true to his main character and hackman was a pretty engaging actor to observe i mean these conspiracy movies are mostly drowning in the character pool of noir heroes lots of questions unanswered lots of dis communication well this takes at least bergman to build a movie about such un visual bases br br the next man is a perfect example of its time one political soup served with an idealistic character and an horrendous conspiracy tightening its web around him neither part is interesting in itself and the whole doesn't get any better in fact you can tell how much it will be bad from the very first sequences piling up 'watcha that' murders without ever advancing any storyline pedestrian directing at its worst as most of the movie is one pompous accumulation of scenes revolving around violence naively brought under the viewer's eyes,0
anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies this movie was an insult to watch the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography the blair witch project had better cinematography and i hate that move with a passion the storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination okay thats all good and fine but they still could have done better things with this script than what they did i mean come on the indian in the store did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the indian and the entire story about an indian spirit called wendigo which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here so you think okay creepy ghost scenario but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy that was so lame it goes beyond pathetic the ending left you wondering not only what happened to otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of omg why the hell did i just waste my time watching this this is a move that i recommend not to watch there are definitely better quality films out there that won't insult your intelligence thank god i never had to pay to see this movie i would have demanded my money back for those that were easily entertained by this movie it's very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie,0
i have only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when i was rather young so much of the movie is blurred in trying to remember it however i can say it was not as funny as a movie called killer tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor timmy other than that the movie is really just scenes of little tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people acting scared and overacting as people should do in a movie of this type however just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song do not a good comedy make granted this movie is supposed to be a b movie nothing to be taken seriously however you should still make jokes that are funny and not try to extend a mildly amusing premise into a full fledged movie perhaps a short would have been fine as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to gun down a larger tomato was actually pretty good the trailer itself looked like a mock trailer but no they indeed made a full movie and a rather weak one at that,0
this has to be one of the best comedies on the television at the moment it takes the sugary sweet idea of a show revolving around a close family and turns it into a quite realistic yet funny depiction of a typical family complete with sibling and parent spats brat brothers over protective fathers and bimbo sisters i'm almost surprised it's disney br br to its credit '8 simple rules' knows it's a comedy and doesn't try to be more too many shows eg 'sister sister' and 'lizzie mcguire' think just because its lead characters are now teenagers then they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humour by being too hard hitting this is a trap '8 simple rules' has avoided it does tackle some issues such as being the school outcast but it has fun while doing so in fact the only time it has really been serious was understandably when it sensitively handled the tragic death of john ritter and his character br br and i think although john ritter will be sadly missed since he was the reason the show made its mark '8 simple rules' can still do well if it remembers its humour and doesn't make cate's father a second version of paul hennessy,1
i only rented this movie because of promises of william dafoe and robert rodriguez i assumed that upon seeing rr's name on the cover as an actor that this movie would be good it sounds like a movie that rodriguez would of made so if he's going to lend his name to it than it has to be good right wrong wrong wrong by far the worst editing since manos hands of fate the way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wont even want to try to follow it anymore i have no idea how dafoe and rodriguez got involved in this film maybe they owed somebody but they are way to good for this besides they were only in this movie for a couple minutes apiece and rodriguez didn't even talk so if you wanna see a movie with poor editing poor acting and confusing storyline than be my guest but don't say you weren't warned,0
i love this movie as a kid this was one of the first movies i saw that made me flinch sure it is mild now but back in the day it was awesome dentists are one thing so many people fear so why not do a movie about a killer dentist it's cheesy it's fun sometimes it's scary but it is awesome and i have always had a love for medical horror and corbin bernsen plays dr feinstone perfectly no one could have done it better and for a low budget horror film the effects and such are quite good and i also love the theme music it goes well with the film ken foree dawn of the dead is also in this one playing a nosy cop and does a fine job there is a fair amount of blood and some really cool torture death scenes check this one out,1
i love this movie it was one of my favorite movies the action never stops the whole movie was done very well the ending is really good ontop of it being action filled they even have a surprised put in there for you when i saw what the movie was about on the internet i was kind of not sure if i wanted to see this movie but sense i am such a big luke perry fan i decided to give it a chance i am glad that i did give it a chance because this was a very well though out movie it was very original whoever thought up this movie gets a standing ovation from me the acting was great luke perry did an excellent job once again i give this movie the highest rating,1
tenants two writers struggle to complete their books in an all but empty apartment house they at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to build br br this is based upon a bernard malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel very little of the dialog is natural its purple and brimming with shades of meaning its as if a college english major with a head full of pretensions wrote the script it's awful and i found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom snoop dog on down are fine form unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premise br br i can't really recommend this movie while not really bad its very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away i lost interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end if you're interested i'd try it on cable but i wouldn't lay out good money to see it,0
for anthony mann the western was 'legend' and 'legend' makes the very best cinema mann's work was full of intensities and passions visually dramatic and the action always excitingly photographed br br stewart a docile actor with the ability of displaying anger neurosis and cruelty made with anthony mann five remarkable westerns winchester '73 bend of the river the naked spur the far country and the man from laramie br br in winchester '73 stewart reveals his darker side he offers all the reserves of anger inner ambivalence and emotional complexity in his nature that his audiences had up till this time failed to catch br br a carefully chosen cast increases the proceedings in fine style shelley winters is at her saucy best dan duryea perfect as the vicious sneering psychopathic villain john mcintire great as the unscrupulous character charles drake so good as the man who attempts to face his tormentor and a very young rock hudson attempts the role of an indian chief br br winchester '73 is the story of a perfectly crafted and highly prized rifle in the dodge city kansas of 1876 stewart and his estranged brother who bears another name stephen mcnally compete fiercely for possession of it and though stewart wins mcnally steals it and sets off cross country with stewart in pursuit what gives the pursuit an element of the demonic is stewart's determination to revenge his father's death at the hands of that same renegade brothera revenge fed by long standing fratricidal hatred br br photographed in gorgeous black white the film comes on as powerful and arresting acted with deep feeling and intense concentration not only by stewart but by all the supporting characters br br look fast for a promising newcomer tony curtis the soldier who finds the rifle after the indian attack,1
this is an hybrid creature born at carl macek mind with robotech the second generation robotech masters and megazone 23 into one miserable movie that have no logic the story is very very bad and you cannot forgive the action of megazone when have nothing to do with robotech if this movie have so high rank is for the tv series and not for itself i did said it the name cannot save this,0
i've probably been spoilt by having firstly seen the 1973 version with michael jayston and sorcha cusack so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment i just didn't get any chemistry between the 2 main stars a lot of staring and theatrical acting just doesn't do it for me and what was all that about putting tim in the role of rochester had the casting director actually ever read the book very strange he's a fine actor but mr rochester he definitely isn't and zelah was just well strange bit of a mix matched couple in it's favour the supporting cast were pretty good and the lowood scenes for me were the best of the adaptation but overall didn't capture any of the magic of the novel certainly wouldn't ask anyone to watch it as a true adaptation of the novel a real let down,0
i cherish each and every frame of this beautiful movie it is about regular people people we all know who suffer a little in their life and have some baggage to carry around just like all of us robert deniro ed harris and kathy baker breathe life into their portrayals and are all excellent but harris is especially heartbreaking and therefore very real you would swear he really is a trucker who drinks so he won't have to feel anything baker as his put upon sister also has some delicate moments when deniro gives her flowers in one scene it seems like she was never given flowers before and probably wasn't very worthwhile,1
from the start you know how this movie will end it's so full of clichés your typical nra member will not even like this movie i give it 2 out of 10 only because of the acting of william benton i can't believe people voted 6 for this movie it's so biased towards a 'certain point of view' once a thief people aren't born bad neither are they born good they are born with a clean slate it's society parents and education what makes them who they are and if they take the wrong turn somewhere down the line it certainly isn't going to be the american penal system that gets them back on track anyway avoid this movie like the plague i bet you have better things to do with your time than waste it on this piece of crap br br,0
this movie was probably the biggest waste of my life ever the acting was pathetic jordan hinson could not show any upset emotions at the beginning of the movie she was supposed to be discouraged instead she bobbed her head with her bottom lip stuck out she sobbed pitifully without any tears for the crying scene i was almost angry that out of all girls who wanted to be actresses they had to pluck out her everyone else was suffering from over acting as well it was flat out annoying it was also an insult to figure skaters jordan took a month to train and they cast her as a person who makes the olympic team it's practically spitting on the effort real figure skaters put into their work a pitiful excuse for a movie and a pitiful attempt to associate hockey and skating don't waste your life it doesn't even deserve one star,0
the filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic i liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the 1930's chinese mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions i felt i could get a real sense of the times recreated even in splendid shots of traditional chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living it seemed worthwhile to experience the interwoven role which buddhism plays is probably the most true to form both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect perhaps the most effective that i've seen in chinese film casting is great images are memorable acting is solid enough thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression,1
i liked this movie a lot i rented this expecting something not too bad to spend an evening it turned out a particularly satisfying experience some scenes were hilarious and managed to be so in a movie not intended to be just a stupid slapstick comedy but with some meaning and moral values it manages on both counts the leads are all good but especially the guy who stars also wrote and produced the movie i've never seen any of these actors before but they were likable and made me care about what happens to them in the end which is saying a lot the script is clever and involving and has a refreshing feel to it i think you wont be disappointed to watch this,1
one word can describe this movie and that is weird i recorded this movie one day because it was a japanese animation and it was old so i thought it would be interesting well it was the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge on the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not very strange if you are a fan of animation science fiction you might want to check this out,1
people tend to complain about the number of films being made about mentally disabled people i don't see this as a valid criticism no more than complaints of too many films about any sort of people jaco van dormael does a wonderful job with the script and direction daniel auteuil and pascal duquenne work perfectly together with duquenne basically playing himself the film covers a surprisingly large ground of events and isn't simply content to go over what was seen in rain man the ending is rather depressing but it doesn't ruin the wonderful story that has come before br br 7 8 out of 10,1
lorenzo lamas stars as some type of cia agent who captures some exotic beauty named alexa kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers o j simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble i must admit i'm not a fan of lorenzo lamas or his movies he stinks however when compared to o j simpson and lamas' comatose wife kinmont lamas seems like ah jean claude van damme i only saw cia because of the renewed interest around the o j simpson trial you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels you couldn't escape this movie in 1994 you could go to an amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable tv the movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of o j simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor also where was bobby knight and kobe bryant to make this a complete camp classic br br out of 4 bad,0
this is not an all around terrible comedy but it is very dull it has barely any laughs and it wastes its lavish production values there is one poignant moment near the end when fu manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his nemesis and tells him that you've been my one worthy adversary and now we can start all over again that scene however along with burt kwouk's amusing cameo in the beginning are the only memorable parts of the movie 1 2,0
i love this anime i was laughing my head off with all of the jokes and the violence mostly from akane ranma's reluctant but short tempered fiancee is so slapstick however ranma does deserve it but he does try his best to make amends clumsily the main character ranma goes to china to train only to fall into the cursed jusenkkyo spring and turns into a girl when splashed by cold water from then on it's pure chaos one after another among the stand outs are the deranged brother and sister duo of kuno and kodachi the sexy shampoo the pervert happosai all causing trouble for our hero heroine however it is ranma's selfish father genma who winds up being the culprit for the mess most of the time if anyone want an anime that's funny this is the one it's cuter and better with the japanese dub,1
bill and ted's bogus journey is possible the most excellent film i have ever watched though the acting and scenery etc is poor who cares the story line is brilliant and the jokes and words they come up with are most excellent the ideas are great as well i recommend anyone to see this classic the best part is obviously when they 'melvin' death i was cracking up for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the film this is so much better then the first one which was great as well possibly the funniest movie of all time i think the best parts of the film however are when bill and ted shout excellent and play the guitar solo it was hilarious rock on bill ted and eddie van halen bring out a 3rd film,1
i found this film to be an utter dissapointment the talent available to the director notably stanley tucci chris walken hank azaria and alan arkin without even mentioning the four main leads have been completely wasted on an unfunny mediocre story whose conclusion one couldn't really care about once introduced to the dire stereo typed characters julia roberts is feeble zeta jones is just plain annoying appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity minus the humour crystal just plays his same old hyper active neurotic annoying alter ego and cusack simply walks through his part apparently bored with the whole project br br for what is supposed to be a 'romantic comedy' there is absolutely no romance between the central characters let alone chemistry and as for the comedy possible spoilers well the only moments of mild humour came off the back of cusack's role in grosse pointe and his relationship with alan arkin the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever spoilers azaria was reasonably amusing as the mexican lover and walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse maverick dogme type director but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead spoilers we were treated to billy crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog pure genius br br for a huge fan of the majority of john cusack's work not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast i was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost 'gross out teen movie' humour at times br br a very poor 4 10,0
here in brazil is very rare to see a good brazilian film and brant´s new film is exactly one of these jewel there are some flaws in the film of course but they are very minimal the directing and acting in this film are very good br br can´t wait to see another brant´s new film,1
really br br i am truly amazed to see the glowing reviews here br br this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is one big pathetic grainy cliché i would have laughed out loud and a lot but was on a date with an ex military guy i could not hide my other response boredom yes i think my date a flat line good old boy liked it that's not a compliment i know an actor wants to work fine for the others but ralph come on br br it was a painful tease from ralph i vote a 2 only because ralph looked so stunning but i must plead ralph how could you and why br br i'm going to go watch the end of the affair to heal and recover now c1,0

a woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo both zombie related but perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too br br the zombie chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films i have ever seen in fact i must confess so bad was it i fast forwarded through most of the garbage and there was a lot of that believe me it runs for just 69 minutes and there is still tons of filler you get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups plenty of dull kissy kissy scenes between goofy teens that rhymed tee hee and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors br br as for the title characters they barely even have a footnote in the film why you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature though considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are amongst other 'delights' maybe that's a blessing in disguise br br and to top it all off it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on youtube jerky camera work scratches on the print flickering lights i had to rub my eyes when i realised it was made in 2001 and not 1971 even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date br br if you think i'm not qualified to do a review of chronicles having not seen the whole film then go ahead you try sitting through it i betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving it is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your dvd player with this gigglesome excuse for horror in fact don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning leaving you doomed to watch vhs tapes for the rest of your life you have been warned 0 10 br br p s what kind of 18 rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene see the movie can't even get that part right,0
unfortunately there was not a 0 for a rating or else i would've chosen it this movie lacks the star power that the original movie had in such abundance carol burnett albert finney tim curry bernadette peters edward hermann the innocence of newcomer aileen quinn and expert directing from seasoned pro john huston father of actress angelica huston is what made this film so charming even the 1999 remake with kathy bates victor garber alan cumming and kristin chenoweth had more to offer than this sorry excuse for a sequel before she did this movie all ashley johnson was known for was her role as little chrissie seaver on the prime time show growing pains she had a few bit parts in movies but i don't know who thought she had talent enough to carry a movie on her own and adding joan collins as lady edwina hogbottom ridiculous they couldn't get good enough actors to play the major roles like daddy warbucks miss hannigan and annie but they will sign joan collins to play some british lady it doesn't surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was the critics were right to have not agreed with this movie even if it was only made for tv it was a poor sequel to an otherwise lovable movie,0
let's just say i had to suspend my disbelief less for spiderman than i did for hooligans that is to say i have less of a problem believing toby mcguire can stick to buildings than i do elija wood throwing down with toughs in manchester i won't get into specifics as i don't want to write a spoiler but the idea of grown professional british men getting into near death scraps every weekend is well funny and this film is not the fighting the idea of fighting is taken far too seriously the gravity of the pugilism the reverence with which the subject matter is treated becomes irritating as it neither establishes or resolves the conflict it seems as though the plot with holes big enough to drive a guiness truck through has been slapped together with a contrived fish out of water theme so that viewers can gaze into woods teary eyes as he learns how to become a man ie hitting other young men of opposing football tastes with blunt objects and then running away as fast as he can the characters are cartoonish especially the americans at harvard the character development and story line are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the picture unfortunately the absurdity of the film doesn't reach its height until nearly the end which by then you'll have spent nearly two hours of your life you are never getting back pick up the football factory or fight club instead of this corny and disappointing dud it doesn't waste time with empty melodrama the tired old yankee in king aurthur's court or weepy parables of coming of age bullsh t they're just pure dark and clever fun the way violence is supposed to be,0
this movie lost me with the crossbow rpg rocket propelled grenade it was like someone cut and pasted a scene from robocop i half expected beowulf to say exclaim i like it br br i watched this because i like chris bruno from the dead zone tv show and he did his part he chose a strange accent but at least he kept it consistent for the whole movie unlike any of his costars they kept slipping into all kinds of speech from old english to modern english sometimes in the same sentence br br there are already many comments on how this movie is different from the source material however even on its own this movie's plot is not good it's just boring which even the low budget doesn't excuse having a low budget means that you need to at least have a good story dialog and decent acting those things don't cost much instead they spent their money on half assed cgi and some decent costumes and sets br br life is too short to watch this movie,0
this may not be the very worst movie peter sellers ever did i think that laurel goes to the prisoner of zenda but it is surely the most depressing sellers especially sans makeup as nayland smith looks like he has just undergone chemotherapy as fu manchu he looks hardly better and spends most of the film with the exception of those strangely disturbing scenes where he gets jolted with electrical currents on the verge of collapsing under the weight of all that makeup the supporting players also look tired and run down and sid caeser's presence is offensive even without his constant references to chinks one bright spot this would be one of the last times a major motion picture would portray asians so insultingly or for that matter star a non asian as one the film seems surprisingly cheap with soupy photography and drab sets even the whiz bang elvis number at the end looks cut rate only the stunning helen mirren and the tall thin nervous guy who get his pants wet add any sparks of life to this sad affair all in all this film provides an eerie premonition of a great comic's death and an even eerier documentation of his dying,0
i have a high tolerance level for crap so i was looking forward to this it did not disappoint apparently based on sheridan le fanu's classic carmilla it follows a father and daughter hunting a female vampire who luckily happens to be travelling with them then we have santa claus or the general as he likes to be called here running over random zombies did i mention there was a zombie outbreak the dead are returning to life but nobody seems too concerned we have construction worker zombies soldier zombies and even st trinian schoolgirl zombies apparently santa claus is looking for his daughter who has been turned into a vampire oh wait there are no vampires the girl is in a lunatic asylum and carmilla is her nurse or is she the zombies are back and santa's mad lesbian sex i like vampires and i like zombies but i especially like lesbian sex nothing like some simulated cunnilingus to get the juices flowing when are we going to see vampires fight zombies is she a vampire or is she a lunatic or both is carmilla a hot sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse more cunnilingus you can never have enough cunnilingus here come the st trinian zombies chainsaw time more lesbian sex then the zombies kill and eat the vampires i guess the zombies won or did they plot who needs a plot when you've got lesbian vampires and schoolgirl zombies and cunnilingus,0
wwf survivor series 2001 br br this was among the worst events of 2001 perhaps its biggest flaw was the fact that it didn't follow suit to most of the previous survivor series' there was only one survivor series match and that survivor series match went on for 45 minutes what's more anyone with a working brain would know that it would end with the rock versus austin and the rock prevailing for his team and don't get me started on the preview before the event no matter who won it was obvious that no one was going to f ing die there was no need for all of that pointless hype whatever the storyline it was just a wrestling event br br and as for the rest of the matches the first match was christian defending his european title against al snow it was a good fast paced match and its good to see a heel winning a match fairly william regal versus tajiri was boring and we've seen it 2 or 3 times before edge versus test was good but nothing great the tag titles steel cage match was the best match of the evening the battle royal went on for 10 minutes and no one really cared who'd win in the first place the women's title match wasn't great no not in the slightest the main event must have been the most hypocritical match in history the alliance lost but guess what after 5 months every single alliance superstar returned the match itself was poor the rock eliminated 3 of them and jericho eliminated 2 the rock was too caught up with his acting to be there when the invasion began jericho was the one that jeopardised the whole match if i wanted any 2 to be eliminated in the early going it would be them everyone knew that kane big show and undertaker were just fall guys 7 matches isn't enough for a survivor series if there's ever a survivor series as bad as this again i'll,0
this movie has got to be one of the worst i have ever seen make it to dvd the story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that i highly caution parents on but the story line is like a loose cannon if there was such a thing as a drive thru movie maker this one would have sprung from that it reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were put out in the 1960's poor script writing and filming br br the only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver the rest of the film could have easily been made by middle school children i give this film a rating of 1 as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated my advice don't watch it,0
this is the kind of film for a snowy sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you descend into a big arm chair and mellow for a couple of hours wonderful performances from cher and nicolas cage as always gently row the plot along there are no rapids to cross no dangerous waters just a warm and witty paddle through new york life at its best a family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received,1
in a horror movie that is alright first off lets start with kate her main goals include getting laid by george clooney looking good and last but not least screwing everyone over gotta love her she had about 3 amazingly good chances to finish off this sicko but instead she ran i mean she didn't wanna bring guy out for 10 minutes and when she did it was too late i mean the guy tried to rape her i cant get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot i mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who finishes off everyone she has meet in a night the movie kept going on and as a result lost all its credibility,0
i think i truly love this film prix de beaute was originally a silent film but later dubbed into french in 1930 despite having someone else's voice dubbed over hers this remains a stunning tour de force for louis brooks the fact that her singing voice is dubbed by the legendary edith piaf helps to mollify us purists about the dubbing deception br br this is the story of lulu and we first see her at a resort with her macho boyfriend andre georges charlia and their friend antonin augusto bandini lulu enters the frame as a pair of legs we see her inside the car changing into her bathing costume lulu is very free with showing off her body and this does not sit well with the irksome andre when lulu considers applying for the title of 'miss europe' we know that a happy ending is not going to be sitting at the end of easy street br br the film seems to focus a lot on men ogling beautiful women we see plenty of bathing beauties and the reactions of the men staring at them but at the center of it all is the magnificent louise brooks br br if you don't mind watching films from the bygone eras then consider checking out this one louise brooks is not a name that most average movie buffs may readily know but as soon as you see her you will be mesmerised and you'll want to know more also check her out in 'pandora's box' if you can find it br br be wary of the us kino dvd release i don't know if their projection speed is correct a lot of the scenes appear to be shown at too fast a speed this may have been the way they were shot i don't know but since it's the only way to see this film it's worth swallowing that one minor bitter pill,1
i have seen many good korean movies including thrillers and movies with darker overtone but this one sucks the director seems to be a sadist who happened to get someone to produce some junk the movie lacks any sort of entertainment value and is not even a thriller i can't believe someone really made such a movie even though acting is ok the story line and the feeling it leaves is awful br br i am sure i am not going to see any movies of this director no sense of movie making and utter disappointment in having thriller moments all this has is showing scenes with psychopath wasting the reels with badly shot scenes and showing more blood and violence thinking that makes it thrilling very disappointing movie and i strongly recommend skipping all the movies of this sort,0
how unfortunate to have so many of my a list and good b list actors agree to do this movie but they did and that is what sucked me into watching it i had never heard of this movie but there was cuba gooding jr right on the dvd cover and james woods in the background how bad can it be in a word very this movie starts o k has some twists and turns then just lays an egg the ending was so weak it was as if the writer got called away and his 4 year old son sat down at the type writer and hacked out the ending how ironic a for a movie titled the end game to have such a poor one these are the types of movies that can move a list actors to the b list in hurry i hope cuba gooding jr and james woods don't make a habit of this,0
all hype what better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can't release their film through a mainstream distributor consequently they do it themselves otherwise the hype of the film doesn't justify the content in the film the story is absent and could easily be a short the acting is poor but the animation and music is pretty good otherwise don't waste your time don't believe the hype however if you have the chance to see the film for free do so then you won't have to waste money still the filmmakers do a good job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their self indulgent mini series otherwise they're one hit wonders who never had a hit,0
in a movie that follows a struggling actor played evidently by a struggling actor this does no favours for chris klein he struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display what could only be described as a bland leading man the story exists but that is all and fails to show any basic start middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happened br br one bright light in the midst of this is fred durst who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co stars and does a semi decent job of bringing the backward character of legde to life whether fred can re create this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but i'l be watching out for him in future,0
well its about time i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season's entries while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries at least this episode turned out well its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season in right to die we are treated to the story of cliff and abbey at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation abbey has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back while they speak they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire and this is just the setup people once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes there's also a side effect too every time she flatlines abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it right to die should have the right to go on living forever,1
i have just managed to get hold of the celestial region 3 dvd of the five venoms and what a super job they have made of it a fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any kung fu fan br br the story is pretty straight forward and has been mentioned already so i won't go into it again needless to say it's the fight scenes that many buy the movie for and they do not disappoint only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over rehearsed bruce lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time all kicks and punches come with the all important type writer clicks and air whooshes which is a cool effect though quite amusing br br i give this movie a b good but not great in a way i feel it could have been that bit better golden swallow by the same director a decade earlier had as good a story and better action,1
spoiler do not read this if you think about watching that movie although it would be a waste of time by the way the plot is so predictable that it does not make any difference if you read this or not anyway br br if you are wondering whether to see coyote ugly or not don't it's not worth either the money for the ticket or the vhs dvd a typical chick feel good flick one could say the plot itself is as shallow as it can be a ridiculous and uncritical version of the american dream the young good looking girl from a small town becoming a big success in new york the few desperate attempts of giving the movie any depth fail such as the tragic accident of the father the difficulties of violet's relationship with her boyfriend and so on mcnally director tries to arouse the audience's pity and sadness put does not have any chance to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and the shallow acting especially piper perabo completely fails in convincing one of jersey's fear of singing in front of an audience the only good and quite funny thing about coyote ugly is john goodman who represents the small ray of hope of this movie br br i was very astonished that jerry bruckheimer produced this movie first gone in 60 seconds and now this what happened to great movies like the rock and con air that was true bruckheimer stuff br br if you are looking for a superficial movie with good looking women just to have a relaxed evening you should better go and see charlie's angels it's much more funny entertaining and self ironic instead of this flick br br two thumbs down 3 out of 10,0
i don't think i'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie i've ever seen i've been working on a list of my favorite war movies the longest day to hell and back bridge on the river kwai all black and white which all have good plots rich characters and great acting i've seen better dialog and acting in student written high school one act plays the plot however isn't a bad premise just poorly implemented it's kind of like a traffic accident though i couldn't seem to turn it off a movie doesn't need big money or great sets i e twelve angry men and lifeboat to be good so budget is no excuse what were they thinking,0
i had suspicions the movie was going to be bad i'm a duke's fan from way back have three years of the tv series on dvd well i was right took the family to see it i really wanted to see the general jump again and some of the chase jump scenes were good but to sum it up the movie was a dumbed down tarted up version of the tv show br br jessica simpson was pathetic while i can honestly say that the original daisy's outfits were just as revealing jessica simpson's interpretation of daisy was simply awful sorrel booke and denver pyle must be rolling in their graves as well br br don't waste your money if you are an old tried and true dukes fan like me and my three kids are you will be very disappointed,0
i've seen this movie about 6 times now and each time i view it i'm more impressed by the story and the acting its like watching a train wreck being set in motion its subtle in its approach but very effective in reaching its goal br br spoilers at the center of the story is a very nice dichotomy on the one hand we have deputy major eddy calhoun cusack unknowingly tearing at the old boys network that forms the hart of major of new york's administration and on the other hand we have the mob boss zappati who's deliberately trying to maintain the status quo through all means necessary this situation nicely culminates in the end when zappati orders alselmo to make it easy on himself by killing himself and calhoun ordering pappas to do the same politically speaking br br the movie also contains some really great one liners such as a personal weakness of mine you don't sum up a man's life in one moment the only thing new in this world is the history you don't know br br all in all a great movie that deserves a much higher rating,1
i liked the quiet noir of the first part the acting of pacino and cusak especially their scenes together the moodiness of the setting and the juxtaposition of the old pol and the idealistic youth was effecting i wish bridget fonda had more scenes in the movie she was an earnest and appealing character the film went off the rails for me when the assistant mayor starting snooping around the mafioso to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly didn't want him meddling in nobody in their right mind would meet a mafioso on an abandoned dock in a junkyard here the story became implausible something that i don't understand why did the cop and vito have a shootout if the latter was delivering info that could bring down the corrupt judge,1
why such a generic title santa claus so bland and unpredictable movies before that tried to cash in on the holiday spirit most notably 'santa claus conquers the martians' at least was entertaining to watch because of the campiness to it and all the stock footage being used for some reason that seemed happy to me but this movie just screws christmas in the butt and screws the joy of all the kids santa lives in space his enemy is a devil named pitch santa gets help from merlin the magician how random is this well since it was made in mexico then some of you might understand the way of how the film was made i had to admit some of the effects were just wacky for the time it was a all out cluster of madness though despite all the troubles with the movie it still feels like a christmas movie good conquers evil and christmas still plays a part of our hearts of every good girl or boy in the world or possibly universe thanks to santa claus conquers the martians apparently so i think you should give it a try even if it is one of the worst holiday movies of all time though it should put a smile on your face any day,0

i was intrigued by the title so during a small bout of insomnia fueled by my curiosity i stayed up and watched it i then checked my tv listings and watched it again there is one very obvious realization that occurred to me when i saw this film in spite of politics traditions culture etc teenagers everywhere are virtually the same the characters of the kids from belgrade could have been transported to let's say somewhere in the american midwest during the same time period and language differences aside would be impossible to tell apart from any of the local teens of that era they certainly displayed the same growing pains and preoccupations politics aside music sex movie idols music drinking sports music as a matter of fact much the same things that occupied my time growing up in 1970's southern california br br this was a bittersweet story but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable the characters especially the young actors were completely believable also i won't say this was the yugoslav american graffiti but i will say that it fits in nicely with other 50's themed movies,1
pop quiz you're a part of the modern armed forces in peacetime on routine manoeuvres and you find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change history what do you do well if you're a hollywood studio you change the japanese g i s in g i samurai aka timeslip to the crew of an american aircraft carrier have them debate stopping the attack on pearl harbour for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no one reminds you that japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this sonny chiba movie but unlike its hollywood counterpart the final countdown this sees its premise through thrown back 400 years into the japanese feudal wars its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a warlord to conquer the country  cue lots of tank and helicopter vs samurai action including a very impressive unrelenting 25 minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands inflicting serious damage on each other and yes there are decapitations br br of course things don't go as planned and even superior firepower doesn't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers even before that the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and pillage for the hell of it impressively directed and surprisingly well thought through the soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction especially when they feature english lyrics sung by japanese singers who audibly can't pronounce the words let alone speak the language but it's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci fi actioner br br optimum's uk dvd is a good transfer of the uncut 138 minute version,1
this film is amazing and i would recommend to child and adult alike the animation is beautiful the characters are rich and interesting and the story is captivating far better than anything the american studios were producing at the time however there is a couple of caveats to this statement it's a shame that disney bought the studio ghibli back catalogue and then proceeded to butcher it my main point being disney re dubbed the film despite the original english version being very impressive the new cast with van der beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters e g pazu and sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers the original music score is also far better than the disney remix it begs the question why did disney make such changes it seems to me is that by having van der beek et al being cast then disney can draw in more money which is fair enough but in the process they tainted they film it is still a beautiful film and i would still recommend it to anyone my main beef is that disney ruined a film from childhood which i loved and still love i am lucky enough to have an original japanese import with the original english dub which i am now going to guard with my life,1
i saw this film at the rhode island international film festival and was completely blown away the structure and execution of the film was fantastic i know it won't but it really deserves an oscar nod cal and andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates yes the film is very controversial and i can see a lot of people having a lot of problems with it as it deals with school shooting and especially makes you identify with the killers however despite its harsh and blunt subject matter zero day is so worth watching i'm looking forward to it coming out on video so i can buy it it's very very good very powerful and intense the end shooting sequence leaves you speechless because it's almost too realistic their uncertainty the recordings the footage and panic of the students totally indescribable i really hope it gets the attention it deserves it's done in the same format as the blair witch project handheld camera made to appear as a true home video documentary kind of film but god is it infinitely better very impressive hats off to everyone involved if you've got the chance you really should see it,1
as with all environmentally aware films from the 1970s soylent green has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is overpopulation means there s too many people to feed i was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies stalin s policy in the soviet union in the 1930s left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was mao s rural policy in china which led over 30 million starvation deaths in the 1950s and let s not forget the great famines in the horn of africa in the 1980s and 90s which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation you might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on earth hong kong and macau have never suffered a famine in modern times likewise the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isn t strictly down to overpopulation it s down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside it s a symptom of industrial progress not of too many births so the image of the streets of new york city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughable br br but don t be fooled into thinking soylent green is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because i consider this to be the best ecological film of the br br 70s it plays on the contempary audience s knowledge of the world where sol and thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit brandy and fresh meat thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line if i could afford it i d smoke two maybe three of these a day but it s the visage of the euthanasia chamber that s memorable as thorn gazes at the images of wild animals flowers running water and snow covered mountains a world thorn s generation has never known this is a very haunting scene which makes soylent green a very memorable film combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of edward g robinson as the wise old jew sol roth,1
there has been a lot of love that has been put into wes anderson's fantastic mr fox unfortunately all the love is for himself granted there has been a lot of time and effort been put into making this ever so self consciously quirky universe but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try and make it funny the worrying thing is that i think it was and this is the best that wes anderson could come up with br br the animation is good in the close up shots of the animals however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess there wasn't really anything special about the acting either with wes opting to choose his buddies and big names over more specialised voice actors that could have probably made the film better i'm pretty sure george clooney's voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in south park one of them where he played a dog br br the film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically despite the film being set in england all the good animals are typical americans playing baseball whilst the bad guys are stereotypical english with the most insulting english accents i cannot stress how much of a waste of time this film is i didn't laugh once,0
this is yet another tell it as it is madhur bhandarkar film i am not sure why he has this obsession to show child moles ion and g y concepts to the indian filmy audience but i find some of those scenes really disgusting what's new it is a nice piece put together by bhandarkar where he shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by leading lady in the famous film mr mrs iyer what makes this movie different is that it also covers the stories of people that this reporter interacts with or is friends with such as her roomies her colleagues film stars models rich people and others featured in the entertainment page 3 in her newspaper br br noticeable it is another good performance from mrs iyer she is likely to be noticed for this role she does selective roles but shines in them she is noticeably de glamorized and less beautiful in this film but then entertainment reporters are not supposed to outshine the people they cover right verdict madhur has come up with another good movie that brings social issues to the limelight very nicely however this movie loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to convey br br is he trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich people or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrasting that with the life of the real crime reporter is he trying to tell us how the government and rich folks rule the press or is he trying to illustrate the issues with child abuse and g y folk the other concepts brought forth include the unwritten rule that young women have to sleep with directors or co stars if they wish to enter bollywood br br in addition he talks about how flight assistants get sick and tired of their jobs after a while and resort to extreme measures by marrying much elder people etc he also talks about unhappy women and spoilt kids in rich families br br this was all okay for me but might be too complex for an average movie goer who just wants to relieve some stress from day to day work,1

i had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school as figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through it had an interesting side to it but it just doesn't live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original we have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust then we have the father who is always gone then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does on to the story like i said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling everything about this fell into cliché the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl they get together have sex and then boom we have a little kid perhaps it could've been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved i've seriously gotten more emotion out of leatherface and his chainsaw than i did out of any actor in this film and that's pretty bad seeing as the leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted so far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie i've seen was juno so far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message like i said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity i really hope someone decides to either re make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential,0
i would like to say that curiosity got the best of me if only i saw a trailer i'd be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie i could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life and about twenty dollars this movie was a disaster waiting to happen and it is an embarrassment to hollywood br br the movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality for example this kid's remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood and even enters this house it's even covered with clothes is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances hollywood obviously did not believe so common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite i doubt the race car could even have reached the street let alone a house across the street another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess why is it in all these movies these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eight year old the kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists please there's more reality in the matrix also the leader puts down his real pistol and accidentally picks up a plastic pistol apparently he could not tell the difference even with a glove on one should be able to do that just because they look the same does not mean anything there is other senses then sight the traps are unrealistic as well if any one of them actually worked the criminals would be dead but hollywood intends for us to laugh at the funny results of the traps i did not laugh i sighed and rolled my eyes br br but i recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie the movie they saw will seem like citizen kane compared to this one otherwise skip this one for the sake of your pride home alone 3 also raises a question we all know alex d linz stars in the movie but did he write it as well,0

i was bored around 10pm so i watched this movie and i could not stop laughing everything was so ridiculous the way the kids were acting like they were older than 11 just cracked me up one of the kids had a ring that supposedly killed people after 3 or so years it gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster br br it's pretty hard to take little kids seriously especially when it has to do with eating worms they act like everything is such a big deal like if billy the main character doesn't eat the worms then the world will end br br this is a good movie for little kids excluding the fact that a 5 year old says 'penis' but not for teens or adults who don't want to waste their time,0

though i can't claim to be a comic book fanatic i have read my share so i guess i'm part of the audience of this film and i wasn't disappointed it does run out of steam near the end it's almost overflowing with ideas and it seems like lena olin one of my favorite actresses was left on the cutting room floor also a little of hank azaria's blue raja can go a long way still it's easy to forgive all of these faults when you have a film which is this much fun all the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles especially william h macy as the straight arrow shoveler and janeane garofalo as the bowler and unlike some i found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier i also liked how disco was the music of choice of the bad guys somehow it seemed appropriate,1
i saw this film on television years ago but here several years after i wake up in the morning and still remember her face br br this film is the most profoundly terrifying film i have seen,1
i have passed several times on watching this since i figured it was some dumb sappy dated romantic comedy well it is a romantic comedy and maybe a little dated however it is not overly sentimental touching as it does on themes of office politics adultery and loneliness you think you know exactly where things are headed but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest and not everything turns out quite as you had expected but there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic if you meet someone who doesn't like this movie seriously consider how well you want to know them,1
i saw this little belgian gem two days after seeing 'american teen' make no mistake about it adolescence is a roller coaster ride be it american or european 'naissance des pieuvres' or as it is being called in the u s 'water lillies' is a tale of a young 15 year old girl played by pauline acquart who at times resembles a young scarlett johansson acts the cool withdrawn girl who wants to be on the school swim team just to be close to another attractive girl adele haenel it's more than obvious that marie is more than attracted to floriane figuring among all of this is marie's rather plump unattractive friend anne who just wants a boyfriend like any other girl her age along the way we are shown the usual array of teen pastimes broken hearts shop lifting alcohol and or drug use casual sex etc this is a quiet little film that takes time to work it's way into your system michael bay fans take note the pacing here is s l o w so steer clear but if you have no problem with this water lillies is a charmer no rating here but would pull down a hard r due to language nudity adult situations,1
since the 70s writer producer director charles band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science fiction fantasy and horror b movies some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget to maximum effect many of them are pretty bad trancers 1985 was one of those rare gems br br a terminator style tale of time travel and action trancers saw tim thomerson playing jack deth a future cop given the task of tracking down bad guy whistler who travels into the past by inhabiting the body of an ancestor whistler is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers converting them into obedient zombies the 'trancers' of the title and attempts to alter the course of history by killing off the ancestors of the leaders of the future jack follows him to 1985 determined to stop him br br in this 1991 sequel jack is still living in 1985 having destroyed whistler he has settled down and married leena helen hunt the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie but for jack things don't stay calm for long and trouble appears in the form of whistler's brother e d wardo who is trying to build a trancer army br br trancers ii lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was the story is difficult to pick up if you haven't seen the first film or at least not for a long while and there is loads of unimpressive action and a few poor special effects gone is the inventiveness and wit that made trancers so much fun instead we get some cheesy one liners and a script that feels like it was written on the fly br br about the only reason i can give for recommending this film to fans of the genre is the cast which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of sci fi and horror movies jeffrey combs barbara crampton richard lynch martine beswicke unfortunately most of them seemed to be having an 'off day' whilst filming trancers ii and performances are mediocre at best br br the trancers series obviously has its fans four further sequels have since been churned out unless the quality has taken up massive upward swing i can't imagine them being any good,0
this is the kind of picture john lassiter would be making today if it weren't for advances in cgi and that's just to say that he'd be forgotten too if technology hadn't made things sexy and kewl since 1983 twice has got the same wit imagination and sense of real excitement that you'd find in a pixar flick only executed under the restrictions of the medium c 1983 innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and excellent voicing to produce a movie that appeals on lots of levels it should be spoken of in the same breath with spiritited away and toy story,1
in the film brokedown palace directed by jonathan kaplan two best friends alice claire danes and darlene kate beckinsale decide to celebrate high school graduation by taking a trip to hawaii but hear that bangkok thailand is much more fun they switched plans and decided to go to thailand without telling their parents the change of plans while they were in thailand alice and darlene met a really handsome guy named nick parks daniel lapaine he tells them that he would trade in his first class ticket to hong kong for three economy tickets so that they could spend the weekend in hong kong they accepted his offer and upon entering the airport the two were arrested for smuggling drugs they were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison br br i think kaplan was trying to show the audience that it is wise to make good decisions because in one instance one bad decision can change the direction of a life forever also a friendly face may not be as friendly as we think once we find out the real intentions of that friendly face those girls made a decision not to tell their parents that they had switched their plans and it changed their lives forever things have a funny way of happening showing us what decision we have made verses the decision that we should have made sometimes life is not fair that is why it is important to think long and hard about the choices that we make because we can never go back and change the choices that we have made br br this movie has a great setting it was filmed mostly in bangkok thailand this film also has great music a few of my favorite songs are 'silence' by delerium 'damaged' by plumb 'deliver me' by sarah bightman and 'party's just begun' by nelly furtado i went out and bought the soundtrack after watching this film these girls where young and naive and failed to think their plans out thoroughly a mistake that anyone could make therefore this film is good for any audience it makes no difference young or old we all are human and subject to mistakes even though i did not like the way this film ended leaving me in question of who really smuggled the drugs i would definitely give this film two thumbs up,1
i grew up on this movie and i can remember when my brother and i used to play in the backyard and pretend we were in care a lot now after so many years have passed i get to watch the movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy it if you are parent and you have not watched this movie with your children then you should just so you hold them in your arms and watch them get thrilled over the care bears and care a lot the songs especially forever young are very sweet and memorable parents i highly recommend this movie for all kids so they can learn how enjoyable caring for others can be when it comes down to all the trash that is on tv you can raise your children to have the right frame of mind about life with movies like these,1
i picked this dvd up at the dollar store the dvd was on the 2 for 1 rack but since it had michael madsen in it i thought that since i had never seen the movie i bought it anyway br br i must say that i didn't like the movie the movie played more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else i found that the director's use of flashbacks did not add to the story line for me i would have preferred to view the story line in chronological order br br i won't throw it away like one of the other commentators but it may be quite awhile before i would consider watching this movie again br br who knows since it was michael madsen's film debut maybe it might have some archival value at some future date,0
despite much style flash and glitter this french musical fails to speak the tunes are repetitive predictable and tedious the story is uninteresting as are the many characters br br people break into song and dance without motivation or reason most of the cast wears phony looking wigs and hairpieces and the sets look hopelessly studio bound br br to be honest this video of the restored version was stopped before the end so negative an effect it had on me certainly a shame to have such a multi talented cast in so feeble a final effort br br goes to show i guess where followups in this case to the great classic umbrellas often do go awry one cannot recapture only recreate,0
unless you understand wretched excess this movie won't really mean much to you an attempt was made to interject a bit of humanity into a cold and bleak period consumed by alcohol and drugs it doesn't work br br when salma hayak does her big disco number her voice is so obviously dubbed it is pathetic the producers could at least have gotten someone that sounded remotely like her br br the documentary that has been playing on television lately is far superior and gives a much truer view of that period of our history br br no one with the exception of mikey myers could be accused of acting however he does an incredible job,0
my goodness this movie really really shows the talents of actors billy connelly flexes his acting muscle truly an amazing man if you look at him in absolution as a rebel boondock saints as a madman killer and then finally in fido as a zombie his character in fido looks from cute to frightening absolutely fabulous cariie ann moss is no hack either jumping in career from matrix and momento as a darker character to a heart warming conservative 1950's housewife rare these days to see actors being able to not be so type casted br br now onto the storyline no spoilers don't worry this movie would make max brooks author of zombie survival guide world war z happy with joy finally a well done twist of zombies and comedy br br if you like zombies if you don't like zombies if you are just bored or if you are too busy go see this movie,1
don't even bother with this movie it's bad when judged on it's own merits but when compared to the 1972 original which is a classic it's down right awful and btw somebody commented that the 1972 movie is bad when compared to the book this is silly movies should never be judged against the books they are taken from they are 2 completely different art forms as if this needed to be pointed out but apparently it does if you used this criteria for all movies then 2001 would suck and so would forest gump and silence of the lambs,0
haunted boat sells itself as 'the fog' meets 'open water' in many ways this is accurate there are scares and weird looking people to keep you interested br br however the acting ability is poor at best showing clear signs that this is merely a bunch of friends making a horror film which in all credit they do to the best of their ability when you accept the low budget makes it very difficult for special effects with the ghosts looking pretty much like men with rubber masks on br br many aspects of the film are creepy and strange but it suffers for using too many twists and turns in a short space of time which just leaves you bored and confused in terms of keeping you awake the film does it very well ignoring the irrelevant twisting every 5 seconds near the end you actually want to know what is going on and are willing to wait the 1hr 35 minutes for the climax br br this is no ghost ship but it'll definitely do for an evening in front of the t v,0
he now has a name an identity some memories and a a lost girlfriend all he wanted was to disappear but still they traced him and destroyed the world he hardly built now he wants some explanation and to get ride of the people how made him what he is yeah jason bourne is back and this time he 's here with a vengeance br br ok this movie doesn't have the most elaborated script in the world but its thematics are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society of course like every hollywoodian movie since the end of the 90's the bourne suprematy is a super heroes story jason bourne is a captain america project like who's gone completely wrong in the first movie the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second one he now fights against what he considers like evil after a person close to him has been killed his girlfriend in suprematy by them that's all a part of the super hero story including a character with realistic but still impressive he almost invincible super powers br br and the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world there's no frontiers in the bourne's movies characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye is as in the best seasons of 24 an american enemy who's beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely blinds him funny how mad patriots are now the n 1 enemies of paranoiac hollywood's stories br br beside all those interesting thematics the movie isn't flawless the feminine character of nickie parson is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes but all that doesn't really matter for the bourne ultimatum is an action movie and the action scenes are rather impressive br br everyone here is talking about the waterloo scene and the tanger pursuit and everyone's right i particularly enjoyed the fight in tanger that reminds my in its exaggeration and craziness the works of tsui hark visually inventive scenes lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on american's contemporary thematics the bourne ultimatum is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick,1
this film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments i loved the character of matt and also tiny they seemed the most engaging and funny characters and certainly the most interesting matt is very good as is his no good cousin and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy i must say i saw striking similarities between matt and another aussie actor eric bana my personal favourite part was the brothel scene loved that overall i liked the film and it'll get about an 8 rating the penalty however i was disappointed in it was a side foot curl rather than the appropriate laces blast br br i am of course kidding,1
i went into this movie knowing nothing about it and ended up really enjoying it it lacked authenticity and believability some of the things that the characters said and did were completely bizarre and a lot of the script seemed like it was ad libbed perhaps this is typical of woody allen excuse my ignorance but the whole audience in the theater was laughing so hard it wasn't even at the jokes in the movie per se but at the whole movie itself the acting reminded me of seinfeld's acting where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes they are corny but if you don't take the movie too seriously you can really appreciate the humour of the actors not the characters if you're looking for a random movie and you like woody allen i'd definitely recommend it,1
holes originally a novel by louis sachar was successfully transformed into an entertaining and well made film starring sigourney weaver as the warden shia labeouf as stanley and khleo thomas as zero the roles were very well casted and the actors portrayed their roles well br br the film had inter weaving storylines that all led up to the end the main storyline is about stanley yelnats and his punishment of spending a year and a half at camp greenlake the second storyline is about sam and kate barlow this plot deals with racism and it is the more deep storyline to the movie the third is about elya yelnats and madame zeroni which explains the 100 year curse on the yelnats family in my opinion these storylines were weaved together very well br br contrary to many people's beliefs i think that you do not have to have read the book to understand the movie the film is reasonably easy to understand br br the acting in the film was well done especially shia labeouf stanley khleo thomas zero sigourney weaver the warden and jon voight mr sir the other members of d tent jake smith squid max kasch zig zag miguel castro magnet byron cotton armpit and brenden jefferson x ray enhanced the comic relief of the movie however the best parts were with zero and stanley who made a great team together br br although holes is a disney movie it deals with some serious issues such as racism shootings and violence the film's dramatization at some points is very well done br br i would suggest this movie to people of all ages whether they have read the book or not you shouldn't miss it,1
i'd love to give kolchak a higher rating but the show quickly went from scary suspenseful to silly abc's fault they moved the show to friday nights at 8 00 p m then known as the family hour never should have been on fridays in the first place i was a sophomore in high school and loved the early episodes it was first up against police woman on nbc abc had huge problems with friday nights bad season for them overall until barney miller baretta and swat debuted in january of '75 kolchak should have been a hit darren mcgavin begged to get out of his contract to end the show too bad the writing wasn't up to richard matheson's in the original tv movies still mcgavin made kolchak his own as actors can do jackie gleason as ralph kramden and caroll o'connor as archie bunker come to mind that ins set with the manual typewriters and clacking teletypes seems quaint and ancient today yet that was part of the appeal they were very lucky to have simon oakland reprise vincenzo from the tv films,1
for those who think of dame may witty as the kindly slightly batty old lady from hitchcock's the lady vanishes this movie requires an adjustment here she's anything but kindly or batty instead her son george macready is the loony one just don't give him a knife otherwise his eyes light up and no furniture cushion in the house is safe now we know what he has in mind for the trapped nina foch if he can just get out from under mother's domineering hand br br really tight little woman in danger film that keeps the suspense on high throughout the script never strays from foch's dilemma she's held prisoner in a big old gothic house on the edge of an angry sea they're going to kill her but why her predicament makes no sense the tension mounts as she tries one escape ploy after another but even strangers seem against her we begin to feel her helplessness and mounting paranoia as the world turns away from her br br director joseph h lewis took a big step toward cult status with this film and understandably so then too watch foch run subtly through a gamut of emotions without once going over the top witty too shines as a really intimidating matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can just keep her wacko son in line my one reservation is the climax which seems too contrived considering the timing of the events nonetheless it's a good nerve wracking way to spend a little over an hour courtesy columbia studios,1
a disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be awarded for effort holes doesn't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp for the first time events are not explained in details the flashback scenes really do serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer i must admit that at first i was a bit put off by the seriousness of the movie but soon i realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story besides the story this movie also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities one example where caveman is forbidden to teach zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character like learning to read won't contribute to that holes is a movie that is smart and beautiful a must watch,1
this is a movie about making a movie such movies may be entertaining but they need some substance to do so it did not happen here i am afraid mr coppola did not inherit his father's skills unfortunately neither did his sister who can however make movies which one might watch br br i do wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews br br let's see the lead male actor supposedly a director is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same pitch whatever he says the lead female actress has an expression on her face that never changes the plot is totally segmented in bits with perhaps one single connecting element the movie within the movie idea must be more stale than paleolithic rocks would that be enough br br i regretted every single moment i watched this movie a walk with the dog is far superior entertainment to this unbelievably lame movie it's as if a françois truffaut plot were directed by dick cheney br br brazil some other classic sf movies you must be really joking,0
if you like bad movies this is the one to see it's incredibly low budget special effects you'll see what i mean and use of non actors was what gave this film it's charm if you're bored with a group of friends i highly recommend renting this b movie gem it's mulletrific,0
i have never danced flamenco before but somehow i feel like this movie was perfect the colors how blatant the dances were the gypsies and the rivals all put together made a movie that seemed to have ended too soon i have seen other carlos saura movies and i agree that this film may be his best production i feel that the best characteristics of his past films were put together and aligned to make iberia i appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the activity going on behind the cameras while watching this movie i felt like i was sitting in a small restaurant in madrid comfortably watching the dancers bang on a wooden plank over a delicious fruit cocktail for me this movie fit like a glove i don't know how i will be able to get a copy of this film in the us in the next few years i recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to the livelihood of other cultures it is safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list,1
glacier fox is one of the most heartrending and wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever made br br the film makes you care about each member of this fox family from the blind cub to the strongest their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic set against an inhospitable countryside the audience's hearts warm to the family members br br the music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms br br man remains one of the biggest predators but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living not just surviving beyond human endeavours,1
well what can you say about a barbara cartland adaptation br br there are some amazing actors in this oliver reed sarah miles christopher plummer but they clearly are clocking up the money br br lysette anthony and marcus gilbert have appeared in two other cartland epics anthony with hugh grant who looks suitably embarrassed and gilbert with helena bonham carter br br if you really want to see a watchable adaptation of cartland the bonham carter one is the one to go for a hazard of hearts what a title gilbert is the weak link in that but bonham carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek edward fox diana rigg,0
i have to agree with most of the other posts was it a comedy a drama to me it leaned a little to much towards the comedy side i could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived jamie keeps running into the julio and whats his name in new york how many times do you run into someone you know in downtown cleveland and just how could robert pastorelli dig up yankee stadium to hide the gold again a comedy or drama but it was still entertaining especially for a sunday morning i enjoyed kimberly elise's performance she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously she is a younger actress that is going to be viable,1
this bogus journey never comes close to matching the wit and craziness of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie this installment tries to veer away from its prequel to capture some new blood out of the joke but it takes a wrong turn and journeys nowhere interesting or funny br br there's almost a half hour wasted on showing the guys doing a rock concert and lots of people watching on free tv since when does that happen surely the script writer could have done something more creative look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied up together by a converging them at the science presentation not in this film which pretty much ended the bill ted franchise the joke was over br br the grim reaper is tossed into the mix for whatever reason this infusion like the whole plot is done poorly and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement there's a zz top impression hammered in for no reason there's lights smoke mirrors noise but nothing really creative or funny br br skip this bogus thing,0
i've seen all kinds of hamlet s br br kenneth branagh's was most ambitious mel gibson's was quick and to the point laurence olivier's was the best hands down but now we come to maximilian schell's take on the bard br br for one this is a dubbed version of a german tv production of william shakespeare's venerable chestnut but if there's a slower more plodding more lethargic and worse staged version out there somewhere it must have been acted at grade school level br br having seen it on mst3k helps with mike and the robots taking jolly good jabs at the old boy puncturing the profundity of black and white tv shakespeare and the wisdom of germans acting out an english play and making it look like an ingmar bergman reject br br of course the best parts are the mst riffs best lines i'm gonna unleash the great dane i don't think so 'breather' meet the beatles hey dad will you help me with my science project and my personal favorite during a party garrison keillor's leaving germany yaaay br br but then there's schell playing shakespeare's greatest character much like a department store mannequin would only not as expressive no doubt he's a great actor but here he comes off about as well as paul newman in the silver chalice ever see that one you gotta watch these two on a double bill br br in the end this is one instance where it's true that you're much better off to just read the book at least the book isn't dubbed by ricardo montalban br br one star only for this hamlet ten stars naturally for the mst3k version br br good night not so sweet prince,0
did anybody succeed in getting in this movie br br it's a total mess to me a vague historical sentimental context instead of a plot a pretentious imagery as mise en scene and it lasts two hours br br shame on those who wasted money here,0
i am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film and of the few reviews that there are to be positive i saw the movie and was pretty dissapointed i didn't find it very enjoyable at all it was slow and lacks the entertainment value even the murder scenes are lackluster with real close up shots of generic stabbings that don't look good at all and the supposed great twist ending is really not much i did see it coming and then the ending just seemed cliche this movie may not get much mention but by the little that it does get it is overrated i would not recommend this movie,0
i have a feeling that the warners bros depression era musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years yes we are in the economic doldrums or have you been living under a rock and times look bleak but we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles in the 30's film going was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom footlight parade 1933 was one such film that audiences flocked to while this lloyd bacon directed musical doesn't quite capture the social issues of the time as gold diggers of 1933 1933 does it's still a wonderful showcase of talent we have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece busby berkely extravaganza numbers but boy are they worth waiting for me yes little ruby keeler is a terrible singer and actress and her tapping is so so but busby's magical by a waterfall whisks her and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls into a dizzying water wonderland of course busby's numbers could never really be performed on a stage they defy limits of gravity for one thing and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough wisecracking non musical scenes and footlight also has james cagney in at the one of his all too few musicals really what couldn't this man do he even gets to take over from the leading man don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot shanghai lil who is really little ruby in china girl wig he co stars with joan blondell his adorable adoring secretary who cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women until the final reel that is apparently blondell was the only other woman who cagney loved apart from his wife and you can see the mutual adoration in every scene,1
i have been looking for this movie for so many years i saw this move when i was nine and loved this movie i called disney all the movie stores and the net no luck what a waste it was a very good movie it will be missed,1
i liked it i really did please don't think that i'm an idiot but i have to admit that i enjoyed this film i expected it to be crap it was crap but sometimes its ok to relax and watch a crappy film that you don't have to concentrate too much on isn't it i didn't expect any hidden meanings or morales and there wasn't any but that doesn't matter because i only watched it for entertainment and it did entertain me throughout films like this are why the ben stillers excusing 'there's something about mary' and the vince vaughns however you spell his last name i couldn't be bothered checking have jobs it's ok to watch a crap film as long as you don't expect too much from it and i for one shall take a stand jog perhaps run but not drive because i don't have a car to blockbuster video or even choices and rent a bunch of these toilet humoured films and stay in one night watching them good day to you reader p s if you do not say that this comment helped you then i don't like you if you do say it helped then god bless you you will go to heaven,0
normally i'm not the sort to be scared by horror movies but this movie is the exception some how this movie got into my mind it is a very simple movie but at the same time extremelly effective it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout another seen was the family photo i wasn't expecting that and i jumped out my seat i would recommend everyone to see this movie with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time,0
how i got into it when i started watching this series on cartoon network i have to say that i've never seen anything like this and it was the best but when i started collecting the series on vhs and years later on dvd part of bandai's anime legends collections it was amazing and truly worth watching it had a lot of exploding action that will blow you out of your seat and of course the theme songs just communication and rhythm emotions were the best br br characters and gundams my favorite characters in the show were heero duo relena treize lady und noin and zechs my favorite gundams in the show that i liked the most are the wing zero and epyon and of course the altron and deathscythe i and ii br br meaning of the show what this series also tells us that in real life wars are very hard and we can sometimes win or lose but peace can also be hard to obtain and i do believe the gundam pilots are doing the right thing and are trying to obtain world peace br br but however this show is truly the best of the best so in closing to this review after you watch this show see the movie endless waltz,1
i agree totally with the last commenter this could be the worst movie ever made i too had to fast forward through most of this movie michael madsen must have done this movie as a favor to someone the picture quality is grainy all the way through and what little plot there is is just plain stupid i give this movie a 1 out of 10 if i could give it a lower score i would don't waste your time on this movie or you'll regret it,0
must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time but this one is up there with the worst of them plot troubling to follow sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together film br br i can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two sadly in my case i have the dvd it will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time,0
jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to domesticate but europeans did and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines it is obvious that the person who wrote this comment hasn't understood the reasoning behind this documentary or the original book please don't ruin this great piece by your simple mindedness the reasons are far more complex than the single thing you mentioned please read the book as is it a great source of information i enjoyed it a lot this book is even a taught as a text book at some universities,1
very poor effort that offers pretty much nothing to anyone but a hardcore fan of stanley tucci who tries but can not save the poor structure dialogue direction or talent of our leading man br br pretty much the only trick this plodding tale of a naive new salesman for an alarm company has is its quirky side characters but without a realistic backdrop such characters are pointless br br nothing to see here keep moving br br,0
so i rented still crazy instead when i described hardcore logo to the guy at the video store he said that sounded kind of like still crazy so i rented it was i disappointed well yes as still crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band but that's ok still crazy tells the story of the strange fruit a rock band that broke up in the 70s at the peak of their popularity at a large rock festival twenty years later the band members are all struggling to make a living and are offered the opportunity to play a concert at the twenty year anniversary of this festival they take up the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis touring europe in the process some quite funny hijinks ensue and all the characters go through subtle changes watching this movie you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a participant and that's not bad at all,1
as a knowledgeable fan i recommend this film as faithful to the facts and well acted as an 11 year old living in istanbul i heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream i thought hmmmm if girls like them they must be crap my only records until then were haley mills the everly brothers ricky nelson soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in ismir i heard a song which i later learned was 'love me do' and was floored by the difference between it and every song i had ever heard until then when i heard the 'meet the beatles' album of my older brother i was hooked for life having read the definitive book of their beginnings by davis i was surprised that this movie followed the facts very well with the exception of leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use it did touch on the use of methadrine dexadrine,1
my first child was born the year this program came out and i played the record album for the boys every christmas thereafter when the cd came out i bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start families it invariably becomes their favorite christmas album i recently found several dvd's made on dvd r from video tapes probably for sale on ebay the one i bought was an excellent copy and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years there are some songs on the show that were not on the album and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show but both the cd and dvd will stay in our library as the best christmas entertainment ever,1
one can only imagine the film mr welles might have finished without the interference of the studio this film is a flawed welles but worth every minute of it because one can see the greatness of perhaps america's best motion picture director of all times br br we can see the toll it took on orson welles the filming of this movie the story has a lot of holes in it perhaps because of the demands of the studio executives that didn't trust the director br br it is curious by reading some of the opinions submitted to imdb that compare orson welles with the coen brothers roman polanski even woody allen when it should be all of those directors that must be regarded as followers of the great master himself no one was more original and creative in the history of american cinema than mr welles lucky are we to still have his legacy either in retrospective looks such as the one the film forum in new york just ended or his films either on tape or dvd form br br rita hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here if she was a beauty with her red hair as a blonde she is just too stunning for words everett sloan and glenn anders made an excellent contribution to the movie br br the only thing that might have made this film another masterpiece to be added to orson welles body of work was his own appearance in it had he concentrated in the directing and had another actor interpret michael o'hara a different film might have been achieved altogether orson welles has to be credited for being perhaps a pioneer in taking the camera away from the studio lot into the street the visuals in this film are so amazing that we leave the theater after seeing this movie truly impressed for the work the vision and the talent he gave us,1
this movie promised bat people it didn't deliver there was a guy who got bit by a bat but what was with the seizures and the stupid transformation where was the plot where was the acting who came up with the idea to make this why was it allowed to be made why why i guess we'll never know,0
there are few films or movies i consider favorites over the years the gospel road was one of them i watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again my favorite parts were the fact that br br 1 jesus was blond br br 2 the last supper was a huge meal br br 3 he liked playing with the children br br 4 his death was for all people and for all time br br the movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting but it touched my heart at that time besides i am a johnny cash fan and it was a brave venture if it ever comes out on dvd i will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons,1
i watched written on the wind starring rock hudson lauren becall robert stack dorothy malone robert stack was terrible just bloody horrible he was supposed to be a charming jet setting millionaire instead he came off like a jerk from the word go the plot was stupid and overwrought and the 3 romantic leads had no chemistry somehow dorothy malone won an oscar for best supporting actress although her campy tramp character was boring think the older sister from splendour in the grass filled with malice and bitterness and lacking charisma director douglas sirk has the entire cast overact their way through dialogue that felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes had a cameo by the actor that played the chief on get smart,0
i really enjoyed this movie the script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is outstanding it is a down to earth movie with characters one cares about it brought tears into my eyes a few times but left me with a great feeling afterwards,1
i watch cold case because of the real life experiences depicted this one was very close to me and touched me deeply so beautifully handled thanks merideth all the characters are well developed 3d especially coop the material is still difficult to approach the us is far behind the developed nations of the world only this kind of honest actual experiential portrayal and treatment makes an impact on the population of course not everyone sees things the same way but i am heartened that 3 4 of the men polled in the under 30 crowd voted the same as me 10 you're reaching the hard ones i will forever reserve the best episode place for this episode please continue taking chances and accept my heartfelt gratitude,1
96 minutes of this is cruel and i love the old munster's yes the plot is thing yes the lines are trite but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan there is so much 'intrigue' and i use that word with great pause that i wonder if it's an old starsky hutch episode i lost count of the number of times i noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar refusing to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid 60's ludicrous the producers simply replace marilyn eddie with younger actors why not let them grow and age the addition of an addam's family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the halloween party br br grandpa herman fly to transylvania and back in a few hours preposterous sid ceaser is the most yes the most unbelievable character i am including the bad robots since he babbles an unwild combination of gibberish yiddish but claims to be an ancient arabic ruler and yes it looks like the laugh track is missing in fact there are several spots where there is dead air as if the laugh track was to be inserted later the actors seem to wait on the faux audience it's not laughable it's sad oh and the best part yvonne decarlo has a line that just goes to show you how out of touch the writers and producers were marilyn says something like where could uncle herman and grandpa be they could have been in an accident they could have been hit by a car or a train lily says responds with something like you're uncle herman will be here if he has to drag himself off the train track what's amazing about this is yvonne decarlo's husband was a stuntman in the early 60's and lost a leg and was nearly killed in a train stunt he never recovered and this financially devastated her family check out biography's fantastic review of her life and career this line could have been easily changed to be more sensitive to her br br if you are a real fan of the munster's then you'll have to rent this mess it illustrates how some things are better left alone even with the nearly original cast this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years ago,0
my name is julia ross is a mesmerizing 1945 b thriller from joseph h lewis arguably one of the very finest directors of hollywood noir films this 65 minute gothic oddity from columbia pictures came after lewis' lengthy apprenticeship as the helmer of a string of poverty row westerns east side kids comedies horror melodramas including the incredibly bizarre bela lugosi shocker the invisible ghost and standard studio b product secrets of a co ed bombs over burma the falcon in san francisco etc all of which set the stage rather nicely for what was to come from the enormously talented and inventive mr lewis my name is julia ross as well as so dark the night from the following year introduced a director who had mastered the rare and delicate art telling a dark and probing tale swiftly and efficiently on the most modest of budgets later lewis productions like gun crazy 1949 and the big combo 1955 despite the expanded scope of their narrative structure continued to rely upon deft lucid camera work and effective low key lighting and very modest resources br br my name is julia ross probably owes more to the tradition of british mysteries it's set in a studio bound england than it does to conventional film noir attitudes and trappings a young woman nina foch agrees to take a position in the home of an elderly woman dame mae witty two days after her arrival she awakens from a deep sleep in a completely strange house and mysteriously enough with a brand new identity that of the old woman's daughter in law told that she's been the victim of a nervous breakdown she struggles to grasp the utter and seemingly hopeless nature of her predicament but before long she begins to piece together the strange and troubling truth behind this dark mystery that her husband the always menacing george macready most probably murdered his real wife and that she's been duped into participating in a harrowing and sinister scheme much of what distinguishes this otherwise modest tale are the indelible touches that lewis brings to the production marking it as the first of his truly serious endeavors as a film director,1
definitely definitely the worst film i've ever seen no questions asked contradictors of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others since it's an independent low budget film but c'mon already  the amateurism and meager innovation is horrifying br br agreeing with everything that has been said about this film for example the mind numbingly weak acting when it's this bad you take another go at shooting the scene god damn it the thing i found the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script assuming such a thing existed during the production there was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for the viewers the girls switched personalities several times and they seemed to show absolutely no sing of any rationality or even brains five relatively fit girls against one slight female psychopath  gang up on her why don't you br br the only thing that can be regarded as somewhat of a conquest for this title is the camera not leaving the van at any time thus the viewer seeing everything from inside it which is as the rest of the film a good idea executed exponentially dreadfully br br oh and by the way this movie is nothing like the blair witch project or cloverfield or any other title filmed with a hand held camera  this is an effect and not a trait used cleverly it can be breathtaking but in this case it's an excuse for inadequate cinematography,0
what made the french connection work so well was the relationship between doyle hackman and russo scheider in this catastrophe directed by frankenheimer who also brought us such gems as raindeer games and the island of dr moreau the movie focuses on doyle and his singular obsession of capturing charnier rey the fictitious idea that the nypd would allow doyle to travel to marseilles to find charnier with the help of the french local authorities is laugh out loud funny correct me if i'm wrong but didn't charnier skip town with 65 pounds of pure smack a street value of 32 million but yeah let's send doyle to find this guy it was his pinch after all please the story was weak the acting was terrible with the lone exception of hackman who completely overplayed his part the direction was all over the place even the cuts between scenes were terrible do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one,0
heres a fun fact i was the baby in the movie the one in the crib i am 19 years old now my parents took me to try out for the part we lived in texas at the time i think i only made like 80 bucks for it but i wasn't in it very long my parents said i would cry when i was supposed to be happy and would be happy when i was supposed to cry i was all mixed up strange and funny fact i suppose and no i am not a child actress i am livin' in san antonio workin' at a walgreens i graduated here in texas but i lived in maryland most my life this movie is a great movie though good concept i have seen it several times in my short 19 years,1
a christmas story is one of many people's all time most beloved films acs was able to take the viewer to a time and a place in such a way that very few films ever have it had a sweetness and goodwill to it that is rare br br so i awaited and awaited its sequel it runs in the family the film was almost released a couple of times only to be pulled at the last minute when it finally came out iritf was and is i guess a total failure br br the sets and cinematography were just fine but the directing totally completely missed the mark the film was nothing more than a cash flow formula of lazy casting lazy writing and disconnected acting br br the narrator jean shepard who was one of america's great humorists and story tellers forced upon us a false reprise of the warm wit he used in acs he over emoted and why he did that i'll never know he somehow managed to become an annoying overwrought parody of himself br br the writing and acting in iritf is inauthentic and forced the actors may have seen acs but whatever wit and nuance that was in acs mustn't have registered at all on any of them the acting was embarrassingly slapstick and bereft of any of shepard's dry humor br br acs will always be a real treasure but to call iritf a sequel is to insult all of the fans of jean shepard and acs,0
i'll say one thing for jeanette and nelson even when stranded in a mirthless witless painfully inept musical like this there's still that twinkle in their eyes yes the chemistry between the famous duo is there even when the material is paper thin even when the score is practically a throwaway non existent one depending on just a couple of catchy tunes and even when the circumstances are so unbelievable yes even for a fantasy br br truth to tell she has more chemistry with nelson than with her own real life husband gene raymond in smilin' through which nonetheless was a considerably better film br br sorry i love jeanette and nelson as much as the next fan but this is the bottom of the heap jeanette is more than embarrassing in her one hep number with binnie barnes and nelson can only come up with a blank stare when faced with the most ludicrous situations br br one can only wonder what this was like on broadway in 1938 surely it must have had more wit and style than is evident in this weak mgm production edward everett horton fizzles in an unfunny role and none of the supporting players can breathe any semblance of life into this mess it's like amateur night at the studio even with the few professionals sprinkled among the supporting cast br br summing up painfully clumsy rendering of a rodgers and hart musical can't recommend it even for fans of macdonald and eddy and even if jeanette's close ups still glow with her gossamer beauty this film is jaw droppingly bad,0
i've never been impressed by jd anyway and final justice which i hadn't seen prior to its mst3k airing proves to be no exception it's not that the character is any less likeable than mitchell it's just that there's less that geronimo call me 'heronimo' to dislike br br in fact one suspects that mitchell and final justice were all schemes of a revenge seeking agent of joe don's trying to get the star killed by inducing a heart attack br br joe don must have found a new agent since he's now graduated to comic relief in james bond movies the problem is it's hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters there and his serious characters in his action movies like this one br br as for the plot umm what plot they repeat the same set pieces so repeatedly you'll think you were watching groundhog's day 2 presumably the fact they keep using the same scene of geronimo getting out of jail is supposed to be comic relief of some sort ummm yeah whatever br br on the plus side the malta scenery is pretty gorgeous so that kicked it up to a 2 for me one suspects this flick set maltese tourism back a couple of decades though,0
i'm usually not too into a specific show save for the o c desperate housewives hey i am 20 but no kidding after one episode of reunion i was hooked br br i can't even say how bummed i was that it's time slot conflicted with bush's speech last night because i was really looking forward to the 1987 episode which will now air next thursday again that conflict was disadvantageous because being a new show it needs to build up a following and having the second episode pushed back a week kills some momentum br br that said tv doesn't always have to be emmy worthy to be enjoyable i don't expect reunion to take home any prizes but i do expect it will be able to capture my attention all season ever watch the first few episodes of a beloved show years later sometimes you wonder how you ever got hooked character building takes some time br br the one episode for each year idea is wonderful in my opinion the only other show i can recall doing something similar is 24 with each episode being an hour and having an eventful year is more realistic than a day that eventful please give this show a shot relax about art form it's just tv,1
possible spoilers br br the biggest part of the movie that doesn't work is the wendigo and when your title character fails your movie usually isn't far behind it the filmmakers' interpretation of the wendigo's form is interesting and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly when the fleeing killer sees the wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror for instance and the tree form was actually very good however as a monster character it never really comes to life we don't get much of an explanation for its behavior and what we do see from it doesn't jibe with either the story told in the movie itself or any wendigo lore i've ever read br br i think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it isn't given enough to do in the movie when you boil this film down to its bones what you have is a suspense thriller with a little bit of a supernatural element instead of a movie about a monster br br the cinematography is good though a little cheesy the filmmakers use scenery lighting and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well the character of otis comes across as truly dangerous and unpredictable making him the real monster in the film it might have been more effective to explain his behavior as him being possessed by the hungry spirit of the wendigo which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legend br br i have heard unconfirmed reports from a newsgroup that the reason the wendigo doesn't do much is that when the monster suit was built it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable in order to mimic the stance of it standing on cloven hooves the performer had to walk on his toes that it was nearly impossible to run walk or otherwise perform in it thus the many flashes of the creature standing still and the obvious sped up footage of it running i stress that these reports are uncomfirmed,1
i wish i had my rental money back from this piece of trash so i could donate it to the home for aged actors total rubbish five people watched this movie at the same time and there wasn't one single laugh to be heard lots of yawning though paltrow's a beautiful woman and she was the best thing to look at in the entire so called comedic movie,0
i love sharks and mutants and explosions theoretically with those parameters in mind hammerhead shark frenzy should have been the best movie ever br br it is not br br the monster looks like a villain from power rangers and has approximately the same range of rubbery movement this might be okay if the makers weren't quite as proud of its design as they seem to be that is to say for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action scifi horror flick that could benefit from some mystery the shark gets a lot of screen time granted it is usually shaky and erratic i guess you're supposed to assume that it's so scary that even the camera guy freaks out br br the camera goes to a person about to get eaten the camera goes to the shark the camera goes back to the person about to get eaten only now they are screaming and armless and so on br br the costuming is bad the acting is poor and the special effects are sub par but the writing is by far the worst things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten or so something can explode because let me tell you the people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions more better mindset characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion they shoot helicopters there is a massive explosion barrels rocks trees whatever they all explode so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end br br speaking of which i don't care how crazy a person is i find it hard to believe that anyone would think trying to make a giant half person half shark have sex with a woman in order to make freaky shark people babies is a good idea that is unless that person is the mad scientist in this movie br br the bad thing is the movie is so random and at times boring that even its badness is not really enough to hold a person's prolonged interest it might be a good one to mst3k with your friends but past that if you happen to catch this bad boy on do yourself a favor and change the channel,0
the basic storyline here is aditiya kumar is the spoilt son of a millionaire ishwar bachan who owns a toy industry in ishwar's eyes his son aditya can do nothing wrong aditya's mother sumitra shefali shah warns ishwar to bring his son to the responsible path before it is too late for ishwar is a patient of lung cancer and has only 9 months to live when his son elopes and marries mitali chopra ishwar readily forgives aditya but when the happy couple aditya and mitali come back from a honeymoon mitali is pregnant and this forces ishwar to kick aditya out of the house to make him more responsible aditya doesn't know his father is suffering from lung cancer and he also doesn't know that his father has kicked him out of the hose to make him more responsible ishwar cannot bring himself to tall aditya that he is about to die with a hungry and pregnant wife it is a race against time so aditya does all he can to prove himself to his father and the climax comes when aditya gets his big break in the movie industry and his father tells him that he is about to die br br this movie is absolutely brilliant this is the breakthrough in indian cinema that was needed for the bollywood industry shah's directing is almost flawless but which movie doesn't have flaws the best part if this movie is the father son relationship which is a tearjerker the song interludes is just placed at the right time the scenery is good the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between boman irani and rajpal yadav the jokes are too long and after a bit they are annoying but overall this is a brilliant movie i advise anybody reading this review to go and watch it regardless of other reviews 9 10,1
i had such high hopes for this film because i loved the original so much it seems that disney however is trying to perfect the art of crappy straight to dvd sequels they deserve a razzie several in fact i thought the idea had merit but the music was absolutely awful and the story wasn't much better what happened to the great music disney used to have in their films mary poppins aladdin beauty and the beast the lion king even hercules and the hunchback of notre dame they've made so many great movies over the years that it's really sad that they've sunk to point of making sequels that aren't even good enough to put in theatres br br i hope this movie is not an indication of things to come for the walt disney corporation,0
spoilers the one truly memorable part of this otherwise rather dull and tepid bit of british cuisine is steiner's henna rinse one of the worst dye jobs ever that and the magnificent caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil dude who was trying to steal steiner's invention mst3k does an admirable job of making a wretchedly boring and grey film funny i particularly like it when crow kills mike with his 'touch of death' and when he revives him in the theatre mike cries guys i died i saw eternal truth and beauty oh it's this movie that would be a letdown having to come back from the afterlife to watch the rest of the projected man the film could make a fortune being sold as a sleep aide some of the puns in the film were wicked police inspector electrocution crow shocking isn't it police inspector that's lowe all right tom servo very low right down by the floor police inspector can i get on tom servo he's dead but knock yourself out mst3k is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer,0
this is just a short comment but i stumbled onto this movie by chance and i loved it the acting is great the story is simple and touching and the lines especially from the 4 yr old desi are so cute and sad seek it out,1
bsg is one of my all time favourite tv series i was lucky enough to start watching it as the series came to it's final season it was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride it was br br as soon as i noticed the pilot on hulu i knew exactly what i was in for just by the title caprica although some things don't add up when you compare both series it is still beautifully executed there were no mention about the holobands in battlestar galactica or the mention of virtual worlds but maybe i haven't got far enough into the series for them to explain why br br i recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe technology and alternate fantasies of our world this show is very interesting and will have you wanting to watch more,1
i really like this movie i can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it i suppose that is one of my criteria for a great movie br br the story is very interesting it introduces us to 6 characters each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other the dying master sends the 6th venom his last student to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committed br br how will the last pupil find the other venoms how will he know which of them is bad the way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great br br we also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination it is fun to see how their styles match up against each other br br if you want to see if you like kung fu movies this is a good movie to start with it doesn't get any better than this,1
formula flick of guy who wants girl guy who will lie to get next to girl guy who will get best friend to help in outrageous way comedus reliefus no to help deceive girl etc this one's been done to death and with rare exception of a few z rated outings it's been done better br br stale plot aside the leads are attractive and there's a couple of good moments jonathon schaech has done better and his acting here came close to being phoned in not a complete loss but nothing new here in this tepid affair,0
the ladies man is laugh out loud funny with a great diverse cast as well as having some very stupid but excellent scenes including the funniest love song ever written br br ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant side role br br tim meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written himself some of the funniest lines you'll find in any comedy out there br br it is definitely worth a purchase as watching it every 6 months or so will lead to you still laughing as hard as you did first time round br br i am distraught to think at the time of writing this that it has a meagre 4 7 10 and i urge you to vote br br and remember kids theres more motion in the ocean,1
i may have seen worse films than this but i if i have i don't remember or possibly blocked them out who knows if i was to undergo hypnotherapy i may remember them along maybe with been abducted by aliens as a child or other traumas if so i would happily exchange those memories for the ones i have of watching this film br br i should give the film some credit it did produce an emotional response i actually started to become angry at scenes that spoofed other films and tv programs that this travesty was dirtying them by association i am terrified that i may be unable to watch films like dr strangelove again without this film flitting across my minds eye,0
1st watched 12 7 2002 3 out of 10 dir steve purcell typical mary kate ashley fare with a few more kisses it looks to me like the girls are getting pretty tired of this stuff and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to split up and go there own ways in this episode of their adventures they are interns in rome for a fashion' designer who puts them right into the mailroom to learn what working hard is all about i guess besides the typical flirtations with boys there is nothing much else except the rome scenario until about ¾ way into the movie when it's finally revealed why they are getting fired then re hired then fired again then re hired again this is definetly made by people who don't understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation of it maybe the real world will be their next adventure if there is one even my kids didn't seem to care for this boring adventure' in the make believe let's see they probably only have a couple of years till their legal adults we'll see what happens then,0
a man wakes from a nightmare about bats he and his wife go out into the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon he seems to hear a strange noise and she is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling across their picnic blanket he wants to go on a tour of a cave which has something to do with some kind of work he is doing but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon she relents they go on the tour but leave the group to make out she falls down a slope where she is disturbed by insects he follows her he hears the strange noise again and seems to know a bat is approaching one does and gets in her hair he fights it off her and it attacks him biting his forehead br br they get out of the cave but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort he starts having seizures in which he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people he becomes angry when this happens he's unable to drink alcohol without spitting it out his wife worries about rabies and he starts a pasteur treatment for that but reacts violently to the injection br br and then some people are killed we see parts of the man's transformation into a bat person it seems it is not just in his mind whether the bat bite causes these transformations is not clear since he already was having some symptoms prior to the bite br br while the title seems inappropriate the implication at the end is that the same thing is happening to another person not a very good movie but i liked the variety of the desert cave and ski slope locations and some of the weirder scenes i didn't think this was as bad as other people do and i didn't think the 1999 movie bats was as bad as others think either i rated that one a 5 10,0

i went to see antone fisher not knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised the acting job by derek luke was outstanding and the story line was excellent of course denzel washington did his usual fine job of acting as well as directing it makes you realized that people with mental problems can be helped and this movie is a perfect example of this don't miss this one,1
i cannot say this movie is a disappointment because i read some reviews before watching and it did not do as well as i thought it would have the bar was not set that high so the fact that my expectations were met is not saying much br br the good the city of new york if you live in the city like me you'll recognize certain places and understand that the city is supposed to be more than just a setting rather one of the main characters there are genuinely tender moments humorous conversations and plot twists left and right which all keep things interesting br br the bad the first thing i thought after leaving the theater was that i wanted more but not in the positive leave them wanting more fashion certainly the good skits scenes outweigh the bad but there are a lot of skits that fall within the in between category too many in fact which is what ultimately brings the movie down also new york city's diversity though hinted at though the many distant pans of the city and mentioned in conversation throughout the movie is never really realized or analyzed to the point of doing the city justice for example many of the skits involve well to do middle aged whites i mean i know the city is home to many of the said demographic but come on paris je'taime's plot and character diversity makes new york city look like lancaster pa or someplace really white it is just disappointing to see the city shortchanged on its heritage like that br br still even after having said this i would recommend giving new york i love you a view who knows maybe you'll disagree with my opinion and maybe you won't you will never know until you see it for yourself this review is not meant to deter anyone from watching this movie as everyone's opinion on art differs i'm just giving you a very vague heads up on what to expect,1
i was also on hand for the premiere in toronto this film was sort of a consolation when i thought i wouldn't be able to get in to see my first choice well i was totally blown away by the time i got to the theater i could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie yes i actually forgot who was even in it terrific performances from the entire cast carrie anne moss was great in a true departure from her days as trinity as for billy connolly i think not since chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what so ever the kids were also great definitely check this one out if you get the chance br br and by the way i got to see my first choice anyway and this was way better,1
american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa on the train he met a french girl celine although they met the first time they talked like good friends when the train stopped at vienna jesse begged celine to accompany him to have a tour on vienna then the romantic story unfolded br br at first they were cautious the funniest scene was their listening to cd in music store they peeked at each other though their eyes did not contact after in depth conversation they relationship became close then i saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words br br love is a strange thing when you really want it it will not come as you wished love needs mutual understanding without it love will not last long spiritual harmony is the most important for love br br excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie br br one of the best romance movies 9 10,1
i'm not sure i understand where all these enthusiastically anti grudge people are talking about here perhaps it's just that some people like to rant about things br br the movie was certainly imperfect uneven acting some may have had difficulties with the time changes actors all too willing to go places i'd really rather not go etc but imho there were some things that more than made up for the imperfections br br first and foremost i loved the 'breaking of the rules' bit normally when you leave the haunted house the baddies leave you alone giving you time to regroup get friends and find the token mysterious paranormal type normally semi spoiler alert when you're hiding under the covers they can only get you through that little opening you peek through normally at the end the ghosts somehow have become less creepy because you've found out they're just misunderstood or they've been freed or whatever br br secondly the production was exceptional while the movie was hardly special effects laden the supernatural bits while brief were extremely well done br br probably not the best sort of movie for those who think freddy and jason are the ultimate sort of horror nothing against 'em they've got their place but great for those who've begun to take the conventions for granted and who don't have trouble with the time distortions,1
it is written in stone that disney animations simply must be musicals right where show me because i found this attempt to be much more enjoyable for not containing the hokey made for five year old standard disney musical fare br br while the story was not as enthralling as it could have been it was still quite good enjoyable and adventurous i had hoped for a bit more yes considering the subject matter but this movie is not the bitter disappointment or utter failure it has been billed to be br br the animation quality is average but the dialog is quite compelling as is the story line plot sub plot and amazing creativity i found within this production i will refrain from outlining the plot as it has been done and done but this movie is well worth a view if you are a fan of fantasy br br this is in my opinion the best disney animated feature length film br br it rates a 9 4 10 from br br the fiend,1

if i sit down i will never stand up again that's what the mother the one of the title says to his son when he tells her to get some rest she's just widowed he means that resting is what a woman of his age and in her situation has to do to rest in peace to neglect herself but she's not in the mood for resting not yet she also has a daughter who reproaches her for each and every disasters in her life suddenly the revelation comes sex and passion in the figure of a muscular carpenter 30 years younger than her daniel craig the brand new james bond when she thought nobody would ever touch her again it is a story that makes you reflect on many things specially on what's a 60 something woman is supposed to do with her life when his husband dies it doesn't look that we've advanced that such in those aspects i mean nobody's surprised when sean connery has a love affair in a movie with catherine zeta jones but what would you think if it was otherwise an old woman a young guy nah you ain't ready for that are you br br the movie has intimist tones all along its length except for 2 or 3 sequences in which that tones breaks and out comes some explicit and foul mouthed dialogs those vulgar touches and the way the son and the daughter find out their mother's love affair pretty absurd you'll know what i mean when you watch it are the only discordant elements in the mother br br my rate 7 10,1
this is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen i rented it as a joke expecting to get a giggle out of the first few scenes and let me just say i've never laughed so hard in my life the first scene where ninjas randomly pop out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action movie moments of my life this is not a dinosaur movie but more a movie that makes fun and doesn't mean to at all of the action genre i didn't see the first two but judging by the complexity of the plot i don't think there's to much i missed if you wanna see a movie that goes great with a six pack or any herbal remedy than i insist you rent this movie and sit back and watch a 100 years of advancement in cinema get thrown in the trash and get shat on by carnosours,0
this movie captures the absurd essence of an overbearing american patriot actor one that believes his work and politics are as crucial to the american people as the opinions of the president himself alan bates captures this mindset perfectly as michael baytes and i will immortally remember bates as this character this is a movie for canadians and americans alike it is a valuable piece of cinema that which is able to take its audience through the magic of making a film and reveal just how easy it is for the producer and director to lose complete control to the will of the actors and innumerable outside forces wonderfully hollywood north does not suffer from the subject that it portrays peter o'brian directs with precision and complete control and commands both the serious 'behind the scenes' portion of the movie and the movie within the movie flight to bogota with clarity and insight if you are at all interested in the wit and strength of canadian cinema hollywood north is a great place to start,1
spoilers khamosh is totally unrealistic lacks a plot and was basically only made to see stars portray themselves the most suspenseful scene in the movie was when shabana azmi is in the shower and then we see her tv playing the shower scene from psycho this movie actually expected users to believe that naseeruddin shah's character has a good enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how many br br spoiler begins br br at the end the killer spills his guts to shabana azmi long enough to allow naseeruddin shah's character to run up and shoot him br br spoiler ends br br it is a little humorous only a little in the beginning to hear the director and cast members throwing insults at each other and hearing shabana azmi exclaim oh sh t br br overall a baaaaaaaaaaad movie br br rating out of 2 out of 10,0
i commend pictures that try something different many films just seem like re treads of old ideas so that is the big reason i so strongly recommend passport to pimlico br br the movie is set just after ww2 and the post war shortages and rationing seem to be driving londoners barmy the film centers on a tiny neighborhood in london called pimlico they too are sick of not being able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it that is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter which officially named this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago with this document they reason they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live life just as they want since it turns out they really aren't british subjects where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something you'll need to see for yourselves leave it up the brilliant minds of ealing studios to come up with this gem,1
judaai was a bold film by raj kanwar at it's time in 1997 when such a topic was damn out of the box br br to give him his credit he does succeed in showing how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wants br br the film however is damn melodramatic many places ridiculous br br one wonders why anil doesn't buy a tv for his wife when he earns so much just to show how poor he is br br the twist is well handled but the handling is straight out of 80's the johny paresh comedy which entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it doesn't fit in the story br br even there are several cringeworthy scenes br br direction by raj kanwar is adequate though at times too melodramatic music is okay but most songs look forced br br anil does his part well sridevi is excellent in her part urmila is decent amongst rest kader khan is as usual johny lever is funny paresh irritates farida is decent,0
despite having 6 different directors this fantasy hangs together remarkably well br br it was filmed in england nowhere near morocco in studios and on a few beaches at the outbreak of war everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand canyon br br notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song i want to be a bandit can't you understand it it remains a favourite of many people,1
ah i loved this movie i think it had it all it made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times yes i am a girl so i'm writing this from a girl's perspective i think it's a shame it only scored 5 2 in rating too many guys voting it was far above other romantic comedies just because i'm female i don't enjoy all chic flicks on the contrary i prefer other genres romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be but like i said this movie had it all almost in my opinion great script good one liners fine acting although eva longoria parker's character reminded very much of gabrielle from desperate housewives but so what it was awesome i will keep this film for rainy days days when i feel low and need a few laughs,1
okay let's face it this is a god awful movie the plot such as it is is horrible the acting worse but the movie was made for one reason and one reason only like all of those awful mario lanza movies just to hear the voice of the star in this case pavarotti in his prime okay so maybe the lanza movies were also an excuse for him to hit on women but this movie is about hearing luciano that alone is worth watching the movie a big opera star stuck on himself faces his fears finds humility and love along the way and belts out a lot of hit numbers too br br i must admit i'm prejudiced on a number of levels i'm italian i'm a big pavarotti fan is there anything about pavarotti that isn't big including his fan base and when i first saw this movie i was going out on my own seeing the height and depth of life's possibilities and in love for the first time so as awful as this movie is the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deep of life and love again br br yes it's corny and awful but the voice is immortal and timeless and the voice is what it's all about so i give this movie a high rating in hopes that someone who has never heard pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love especially since he is now gone like italian food that you've never tried before try it you may be pleasantly surprised as a luciano lover or prospective pavarotti peep,1
the plainsman represents the directorial prowess of cecil b demille at its most inaccurate and un factual it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok gary cooper buffalo bill cody james ellison calamity jane jean arthur george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship the film is an attempt to buttress custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends truly this is the world according to demille a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment but a pretty campy relic by today's standards br br transfer considering the vintage of the film this is a moderately appealing transfer with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks there's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments all in all the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract the audio is mono but nicely balanced br br extras forget it it's universal bottom line as pseudo history painted on celluloid this western is compelling and fun just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate,1
i rented this movie this past weekend cranked up the surround sound system and got some great sound from special affects this movie is a great movie rental the special affects where enough to scare my fiance but i noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated i didn't go to the movies and see this but its a scary late night don't feel like going out movie i would recommend it,1
hello i was alanrickmaniac i'm a still crazy holic it was just another movie i watched partly on tv then i had to get the video tape to finally find out how it ends then i wanted the dvd because the tape showed first signs of decay after a few weeks after the dvd i had to lay my hands on the soundtrack then on several film posters and the film script right now it has become that worse that i try to push other people into addiction with my website and still crazy parties br br how could that happen what drove me into addiction br br ok it's one of those funny but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies like only the british can produce br br alright the movie is worlds apart from stuff like ''this is spinal tap'' because of the characters that aren't childish or ultra cool but real this is a story about men getting older too a story about men getting along with each other or don't it contains some of the best actors possible tim spall stephen rea bruce robinson jimmy nail and bill nighy bill nighy who puts on one of the best performances i've ever seen in a film br br good the soundtrack is unbelievable foreigner's mick jones has written the songs for the imaginary band strange fruit jimmy nail who plays bass man les wickes and bill nighy portraying the egocentric but awkward singer ray simms are really singing we know that about jimmy nail but if you've only heard bill nighy's singing in love actually you have no idea how great and powerful his voice is br br well you'll fever for every scene to come for the x th time especially those concert scenes you'd die to be able to really stand in the dancing crowd when strange fruit is doing all over the world singing on the top of your lungs you long to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real strange fruit at wisbech's festival stage br br it's hard but i'm addicted to this film i'm addicted to strange fruit if there's a world where this band really exists i'd like to move there br br got still crazy anyone,1
towards the end of the movie i felt it was too technical i felt like i was in a classroom watching how our navy performs rescues at sea i liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers i guess i should have figured that out before but i never thought about it using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic the acting was pretty good since they're mostly seasoned professionals but if you're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen it should be more like a fantasy comical etc everything was taken too seriously at least the movie had felix ungar as pilot with buck rogers the night stalker and dracula also on board the movie was filled with well known faces i understand that hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature that's why i said it should have been more comical my pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about they walk around with drinks setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later just as if they're in a building or something and acting as if turbulence just doesn't exist also i know it's a disaster movie but suspense doesn't have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something anyway the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after it's first screening i like lee grant but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked,0
br br what is left of planet earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag tag survivors they must eat bugs and insects or whatever after a poison war or something has nearly wiped out all human civilization in these dark times one of the few people on earth still able to live in comfort we will call him the all knowing big boss has a great quest to prevent some secret spore seeds from being released into the air it seems that the all knowing big boss is the last person on earth that knows that these spores even exist the spores are located far away from any living soul and they are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems br br the all knowing big boss wants the secret spores to remain in their secret protected containers so he makes a plan to send in a macho action team to remove the spore containers from all of the protective systems and secret location sending people to the location of secret spores makes them no longer a secret sending people to disable all of the protective systems makes it possible for the spores to be easily released into the air how about letting sleeping dogs lie br br the one pleasant feature of encrypt is the radiant and elegant vivian wu as the unremarkable macho action team members drop off with mechanically paced predictable timing engaging vivian wu's charm makes acceptable the plot idea of her old employer wanting her so much she is an object of love an object of desire a very believable concept br br fans of vivian wu may want to check out an outstanding b movie she is in from a couple years back called dinner rush dinner rush is highly recommended encrypt is not,0
having read during many years about how great this film was how it established ruiz among the french critics specially the snobbish cahiers crowd when i finally watched it about a year ago i found it pretty disappointing but then i guess my expectations were sky high shot in saturated black and white this deliberately cerebral film made for tv and mercifully only an hour long is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime the awful kate beckinsale film uncovered has a similar argument borgesian is a word i read a lot in reviews about this movie but i would say almost any borges story is more interesting than this film,0
this hodge podge adapted from a gore vidal novel actually one of the great american writers makes the magic christian and valley of the dolls look like fellini art works raquel welch with an incredible body and she's actually not very tall in a lead role except for kansas city bomber when she was quite good playing rex reed's bad movie reviewer not critic alter ego only to be surrounded by drag queen great chick mae west horny john huston a young and naive farrah fawcett pre lee majors what a shame and other various creep azoids to pretend to spoof way too may things has nothing going for it except inter spliced old films clips i e widmark in kiss of death lena horne just so they can continue to bleed the life out of everyone br br a 2 out of 10 best performance it's so bad it's worth seeing,0
it is fitting on a musical sunday to get your heart a pumping and no one can do that better than little richard the man could sing the drawers off the ladies and defined rock and roll br br look to leon to provide a definitive characterization as he has done so with david ruffin in the temptations and jackie wilson in mr rock 'n' roll the alan freed story br br this was a fascinating biopic as we saw little richard struggle with his father with his church and with himself over just who he was he won the battle and there is no one else that has his voice or his style,1
absolutely fantastic br br now before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattés allow me to elaborate much as i enjoyed it this is quite simply one of the worst films i have ever seen and is certainly the worst film i've seen at the cinema an impressive claim as i remember seeing daredevil on the big screen the two leads daniel gillies and elisha cuthbert were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst of course they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a daphne celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the oj defence the plot to stretch the term slightly was thin to non existent and the 'gore' scenes whilst undoubtedly brutal were irrelevant and laughably formulaic what plot there is revolves around a twenty something model cuthbert who is abducted imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures both psychological and physical the torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience whilst there really are very very few positives to draw from this film its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film i have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema within twenty minutes the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout for my part i came out flushed with laughter buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film making whichever way you look at it this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film br br p s i omitted to mention that i managed to get in to the film free so i can afford to laugh about it i was still tempted to ask for my money back it really was that bad,0
my all time favorite movie oscar caliber work by everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera the screenplay is perfect and works out the relationship between lady caroline and george briggs in a completely satisfying way unlike the novel the care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer peter barnes and the intense visual beauty should have won oscars for director mike newell and cinematographer rex maidment it is josie lawrence's best work by far and transformed my opinion of joan plowright having watched this movie at least 50 times i can find no fault in it the music by famed composer richard rodney bennet is a marvel,1
by god it's been a long time since i saw this probably about 18 years ago br br the movie tells us kids all about human blood and the circulatory system very professionally put together disney style animation plus human actors it was directed by frank capra for pete's sake br br kind of an overkill i wonder if the very high production value is worth what amounts to a film strip's worth of information on the human body but boy will those kids watching it learn even now i can clearly remember dr baxter being challenged by hemo himself to name what common material most resembles human blood to which the doctor immediately answers sea water,1
this will be a different kind of review i've seen this movie twice on tv and would like to have a copy because it talks about panama city and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there it was the first movie i'd seen by ashley judd and she was great and i've enjoyed every other thing i've seen her in sundance's reaction made an impression on me too as did the director victor nunez who has directed and written several movies about florida this movie speaks to me and i've seen nothing with which to compare it the plot speaks less to me than the surroundings well i told you it would be a different kind of review,1
this movie is definately one of my favorite movies in it's kind the interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to chivalry and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen it treats themes like duty guilt word manipulation and trust like few films have done and unfortunately none that i can recall since the death of the 'policial' in the late seventies the sequence is delicious down to the essential living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake no such scenes are present or needed the argument is sand honest to the spectator an important asset in a genre that too often achieve suspense through the deception of the audience no this is not miss marble a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savor every minute not just to see,1
when you are in a gloomy or depressed mood go watch this film it shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting and it is very encouraging in particular from a feminist and a humanist perspective br br when you know both the turkish language and either the danish or the german language go watch the film in any case half of the dialog is danish in the original synchronized to german in the translated version the other half turkish subtitled in danish or german respectively when i watched it in mannheim germany the reaction of the turkish speaking audience proved that there must be a lot of humor in the turkish dialog which deplorably mostly escaped me being only imperfectly rendered in the subtitles still the film is interesting even if you lack knowledge of the turkish br br esthetically the movie is playing a lot on the theme of speed and slowness on first sight there is lots of corporeal movement fast as lightning making it a quick an agitated film in particular even though this is a kung fu movie watch out for the running scenes beautifully expressing a wealth of emotions but there are quite a few very slow emotionally intense scenes too and above all the characters develop at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama about the coming of age still there is some movement in the characters to closely watch the villain omar whose part and acting i liked very much br br the contrast of speed and stillness nicely contributes to the depiction of human rage and dignity shown at once in the same characters at the same time,1
as a young teenager at the time airwolf was compulsory viewing for a generation who wanted their cowboys and indians to have amazing gadgets and whizz bang explosions br br in many ways the show was essentially knight rider in the skies similar comic book technology a central character who was essentially a loner and echoing the concept of one man making a difference br br but in other important ways it was thematically very different from knight rider street hawk the a team and other action shows of the time for one thing the premise of the series is built not on a desire to help those in need but by stringfellow hawke's possession of airwolf for essentially selfish reasons as leverage to try to find his mia brother st john and then there is the dark edge provided by basing the series firmly in an 80s cold war context complete with soviet espionage and central american dictators not to mention the enemy within sure the a team constantly referred back to vietnam and the team's status as fugitives but it was generally done with a light touch and was rarely central to the plot itself with airwolf the intrigue was key to the tone and direction of the show although this was ill advisedly diluted as the series went on br br with hindsight the cold war setting clearly dates the series many of the stories are creaky and contrived and much of what airwolf does is clearly implausible even with today's technology but that's really not the point airwolf was rip roaring fun it tried to tell interesting stories without relying solely on the big action sequences and it didn't sugar coat everything by miraculously ensuring nobody died sometimes it failed but often it succeeded admirably and on a tv budget to boot br br for uk readers dmax sky channel 155 have just started jan 2008 daily re runs of airwolf set your sky box for this blast from the past we may even get the re tooled re cast and sadly vastly inferior fourth season which to my knowledge has never previously been shown in the uk,1
gritty dusty western from director richard brooks who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clichés intact early 1900s horse race attracts a low keyed cowboy gene hackman a suave gambler james coburn a cocky kid jan michael vincent and even a female a surprisingly game candice bergen once the preliminaries are out of the way with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part this becomes a fairly engrossing entry though one which breaks no new ground it instead resembles something from gary cooper's era good looking if overlong piece has macho verve and a fine cast yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome rather quickly from,0
i saw not so fabulous rating on imdb but i went to see it anyway because i am a big fan of bible related material first thing that bothered me was a little too much indiana jones wannabe movie but it also looked like casper van dien didn't see those jones movies through but he should i believe he tried his best but script just stunk music tried to be kinda jones style too great work but for such movie it seemed like too much work like the video part did't deserve all that great music robert wagner gave his best acting skills he did a good job but somehow the script was bringing everything down jokes are old school somewhere 20 years old they brought only cynic smile to my face there are some really bad camera angels sfx looks like homemade and unrealistic kevin vanhook had probably a good idea on the story in my opinion but i love such stories but things just didn't work out in the end maybe he should put it on a paper when it was still fresh in his head when i in first minutes saw that movie was going to be one of those 'low budget movies' i hoped that i will at least 'hear' a good story but sometimes movies just disappoint,0
five deadly venoms is not as bloody and violent as story of ricky or super ninjas but it features some of the best hand to hand fight sequences in hong kong film history director chang cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece this movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms meng lo plays yet another bad ass he would go on to be in super ninjas kuo chui who is philip kwok would go on to story of ricky and hard boiled any chop socky fan can apperciate this but i still think it ain't as good as super ninjas also made by chang cheh but all chop socky is good and this is one of the very best,1
what's in a name if the name is jerry bruckheimer expect it to be filled with action br br in producer bruckheimer's latest film gone in 60 seconds its all about the nomenclature with character monikers like kip sway and the sphinx and cars idealized with names like diane sue and the elusive eleanor it's only the non stop action that keeps you from wanting to just play the name game br br not a deep script by any means but it is a great vehicle for action as nicolas cage as memphis raines along with angelina jolie and robert duvall comes out of car thievery retirement to save his brother's life by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night a remake of the 1974 cult hit this film may not be destined for the same cult status but it is entertaining br br surprisingly it's the action that keeps you watching not the acting although loaded with stars none of them have standout performances including a very weak performance by one of my favorite up and comers giovanni ribisi even jolie coming off her recent oscar win is just a token love interest with hardly any screen time br br can a series of beautiful cars and the car chases they become involved in make a great film i think so the film is a pleasure to look at and although one particular scene takes you into the realm of unbelieveablity the action is non stop and the suspense is compelling just be wary of other drivers fighting for a pole position as you leave the theatre br br 3 1 2 out of 5,1
my first exposure to the templarios not a good one i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video which has brought us other cult classics such as spider baby the print quality is excellent but this alone can't hide the fact that the film is deadly dull there's a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the templars set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow ponderous ultimately unfulfilling adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket,0
mother night is one of my favorite novels and going to see this i was expecting a huge disappointment instead i got a film that perfectly portrays the irony humor elequence and above all else the crushing sadness of vonnegut's novel br br this is certainly nolte's best preformance to date he captures the defeat and selfloathing of howard cambell jr consistently from the subtle intonations of his speech to the held back tears behind his eyes br br alan arkin is absolutly hilarious as george kraft sherryl lee is haunting in her detachment from reality as cambell's young lover john goodman is understated and more than effective as cambell's blue fairy godmother br br this pinnocioesque story of cambell trying to be his own ideal hero and unwittingly becoming his ideal tragic villian is a mature and vivid look into what we are as people and aside from that it is one of the most deeply romantic films i have ever come across cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love and at the films sastifyingly painful conclusion he finally learns what it means to be a real boy as his blue fairy godmother grants him his wish and he realizes that well watch the movie and you'll see br br mother night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made it is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep within our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author,1
even though this was a disaster in the box office it is my favorite film it gives a powerful message of family it has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis compared to other bollywood films the action scenes in this movie are more realistic it is an incredible combination of akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan if you want to see the indian godfather amitabh portrays that in this film don't read reviews by critic they're just ignorant this movie has good mix of comedy romance drama and especially action so if you want to see action more realistic than main hoon na still good movie this is the movie,1

dan katzir has produced a wonderful film that takes us on a roller coaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles surrounding modern israel br br for anyone who's ever been in love the film brings back the uncertainties the insecurities and heartache that make love so bitter sweet the atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in israel at that time just serve to intensify the feeling instantly you are drawn in to dan's plight and you can't fail to be deeply moved br br you can't write drama and passion like this the contrast between the realities of dan's desperate snatched relationship with iris and the realities of a state in turmoil make this eminently watchable if you have an ounce of passion and have ever been in love see this film,1

ghost of dragstrip hollow appears to take place in a spotless netherworld an era long gone by where the biggest sin a kid could commit would be in defying the law and getting a traffic ticket it opens with a young female auto fanatic getting the business from her arch rival who pressures her into a car race that's about it for the drag racing this b flick is mostly concerned with rock 'n roll man the folks at american international were obviously fond of decent square teens who liked to party and yet didn't mind an adult chaperone there are a few amusing double entendres and fruity exchanges necking kid we thought we'd come out for some fresh air dad where did you think you'd find it down her throat but the ghost is a little late in arriving brief at 65 minutes the movie cheats us with a climactic car race that actually takes place off screen and a pre scooby doo styled unmasking which makes no sense however for nostalgia buffs some mindless fun from,0
much as we all love al pacino it was painful to see him in this movie a publicity hack at the grubby ending of what seems to have once been a distinguished and idealistic career pacino plays his part looking like an unmade bed and assaulting everyone with a totally bogus and inconsistent southern accent br br the plot spools out this way and that with so many loose ends and improbabilities that the mind reels and then retreats br br kim basinger is there not doing much her scenes with pacino are flat and unconvincing hard to believe they meant a lot to each other there's no energy there br br tea leone on the other hand lit up the screen she was electric and her scenes with pacino were by far the most interesting in the movie but not enough to save al from embarrassment,0
absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen the acting the dialog the manuscript the sound the lighting the plot line i actually can't say anything positive about this although i enjoy swedish movies the fighting scenes are so ridiculous that it's impossible to take it seriously and when the lead character just happens to loose his shirt while dodging bullets in a strip bar i'm not sure if it's supposed to be a joke or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good film regina lund is the only half descent actor but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions it leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this,0
what a great barbara stanwyck film that i happened to see the other night jeopardy was fantastic it was made in 1953 and probably for double bills but it kept me on the edge of my seat br br barbara stanwyck plays helen who with husband doug barry sullivan and son lee aaker drive to an isolated fishing spot in mexico for a vacation husband has a fall from the jetty and the only way he is to be saved is if barbara drives back to a garage for some rope br br while there she runs into a psychotic killer ralph meeker one of my favourites and what follows is a game of cat and mouse as barbara tries everything in her power to get meeker to come back with her to free her husband br br the film was so suspenseful and such a surprise i was not expecting such a great film but i suppose i should have realized is there anything barbara stanwyck does that is anything less than wonderful,1
it starts slowly showing the dreary lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april but don't give up on it nothing much happens but the time passes exquisitely and there are numerous sly jokes my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm which i find hilarious the movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word the scenery is beautiful as is polly walker and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfying br br the movie takes a couple of liberties with the book the biggest being with the arbuthnot briggs dester business but i actually preferred the movie's version of this it may be more sentimental but i felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story and anyway i like sentiment when it's well done br br an excellent movie especially as a date movie during lousy weather,1
this movie is a true masterpiece it really is it's rare you come across such a heartwarming flick full of fun laughter heartbreak and with a little drama to keep you on your toes br br a true family film homeward bound tells the story of three brave pets who set out to cross the rocky mountains in an attempt to find their owners following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way one of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities the voice acting is that good shadow is a wonderful character old wise and brave and watching him trying to save sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment chance who wouldn't love a dog like chance he's got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen and sassy is very witty for a cat she had me in stitches when she was mocking the keeper 'here kitty kitty kitty not on your life chubby ' br br there were also lots of well made emotional scenes such as sassy going over the waterfall i was truly scared for her shadow falling in the ditch almost in tears and then the fantastic ending when all three pets return home including good old shadow br br a favourite for all time anyone who doesn't like this film must just not like animals rent it or buy it now and it'll leave you with happy memories that'll last a lifetime,1
many things become clear when watching this film 1 the acting is terrible tom hanks and wendy crewson are so so but the parent child conflict borders soap opera ish the other two boys an overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical i'm a babe but i'm really sensitive inside blonde dreamboat 2 the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing 3 robbie's dreams and episodes are disturbing acted by tom hanks 4 the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice we are all special friends 5 the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting and 5 this is a really bad movie expect to be disappointed and probably disturbed,0
1937's stella dallas with barbara stanwyck hasn't exactly aged well how anyone thought a semi updated version of the story would work now is a real puzzler perhaps they thought jaunty cheerfully brash bette midler could make something out of it but this hoary script defeats her plot about a female bartender having a baby out of wedlock and years later giving the young girl over to the child's wealthy father so she'll have a shot at a better life can't escape tatty old fashioned trappings and sentiment midler works best with a movie director who can control her excesses but that fails to happen here stephen collins is stolid as the man who changes her life but trini alvarado is well cast as midler's daughter this is what used to be referred to as a woman's picture a wallow but it doesn't pass muster because it stays too faithful to its 1930's origins 1 2 from,0
wow i can't believe i waited so long to see this film i just never got around to watching it the plot has nothing that interests me i know nothing about soccer football i am one of those american fools that has no clue i had never even seen david beckham before this film i chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in america enough about me br br truth be told it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of movie making heaven what a fun film it's full of color and exuberance i had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie parminder nagra is so sweet and lovable you can't help but root for her no wonder why the american television show e r has snatched her up i have a new appreciation for indian culture those people know how to have a good time the wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful br br the only problem i had was deciphering some of the british slang and dialogue through the accents i turned on the english subtitles to make sure i didn't miss anything this is not a criticism of the film i'm sure audiences worldwide have trouble understanding the constantly changing slang in american films as well br br this is a perfect date film it has a great sports plot like rocky and a strong sense of feminism that is empowering for women i watched it with my wife and sixteen year old niece and we all loved it i highly recommend it,1
saw a trailer for this on another video and decided to rent when it came out boy was i disappointed the story is extremely boring the acting aside from christopher walken is bad and i couldn't care less about the characters aside from really wanting to see nora's husband get thrashed christopher walken's role is such a throw away what a tease,0
this movie is one for the ages first i have to say after seeing this once it became one of my all time favorite movies why simple ben coccio writer director has put together a true piece of art where 99 9 of movies these days are purely entertainment director ben coccio gives us truth gives us reality gives us a learning tool to know why this happened the mainstream media spins and spins but ben coccio looks school shootings right in the face able to go where no other form of media has ever gone before into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates while it surely is graphic and horrifying how couldn't it be the gloves come off the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is brushed aside and we are taken to a place where we can find truth in what happened sometimes it isn't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think no sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper are more human we are shown that these boys are us and we them society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real br br respect and love your fellow man a lesson we all should learn thank you so much for making this film mr coccio i hope with great anticipation that you will continue your film making career,1
like ishtar and king of comedy other great misunderstood comedies envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially losers may be too harsh a word i will call them suburban under achievers br br this film was a dark comedy gem and i'm not sure what people expect i relish seeing a major studio comedy that isn't filled with obvious humor and i believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile the look on stiller's face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves yes it was a fairly simple story but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way there were a lot of great scenes the j man's decrepit cabin by the lake corky's unceremonious burial weitz's wife role and walken's j man all great stuff br br i can't stand people that get on imdb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one i will take envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year save napoleon dynamite it's wittier wackier and an offbeat enjoyable gem br br remember this people most times popular doesn't equal good,1
highly regarded at release but since rather neglected immense importance in the history of performing arts a classic use of embedded plots one of my favourite films why hasn't the soundtrack been re released,1
rarely has such an amazing cast been wasted so badly griffin dunne rosanna arquette illeana douglas ethan hawke dennis hopper christopher walken and john turturro all jumped on board only to be torpedoed by a script that seems like nothing more than a hollywood in joke attaching martin scorsese's name to this was probably the draw but the end result is way less than the sum of it's parts resembling a nightmare gone horribly wrong each scene seems more contrived than the next search and destroy is nothing more than abstract stylish self indulgent nonsense and the entire film is decidedly dull merk,0
i must say i was surprised with the quality of the movie it was far better than i expected scenario and acting is quite good the director made a good job as well although some scenes look a bit clumsy it is a decent movie overall the idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end the mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good the plot was clear consistent and well thought some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development moral of the story it is a decent movie for its genre and it is astonishingly good,1
the brak show is good probably not in the same level than aqua teen hunger or space ghost coast to coast but definitely it have many brilliant moments basically it follows the life of zorak and brak that have normal lives and go to the school living in a neighborhood on the style of the 50 'sitcoms the humor and the animation of this show it's very much as aqua teen hunger and in one episode you could see meatwad with bizarre situations and strange characters but it is good it have funny parts some of the songs are great others not very much but i like this show the funniest character is the father of brak that is a human nobody knows why,1
frankly i don't understand why this movie has been such a big flop in publicity sharon stone certainly has not lost any of her charisma and touch since basic instinct i voted this film 10 and i tell you why game opens in london this time london is the city where catherine tramell has moved since the events in bi1 again she proves to be a mastermind manipulator of her own class unchallenged she is screwing your brain as catherine with such a skill that in the end you don't be quite sure who is the real villain br br as for the technical part of the film only real setback is the b rate crew of actors sharon stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and michael douglas etc in the first part i also think bi2 would have been better had sharon stone been a bit younger but she is still quite stunning in her looks and has only improved concerning her charisma her b rate assistants are not so bad either although i would have wanted some bigger names to the cast br br i think there are quite good improvements in the basic plot i think this is a far better thriller than many of the run off the mill crap hollywood so readily distributes these days the plot is great it's easy to see technically you don't snore in the half way through the film and most important the heath is on,1
why do they insist on making re makes of great movies like high noon from here to eternity and this one br br why do they think that color is more engrossing to a viewer than stark black and white br br why did robert's insist on wearing that dopey broad billed baseball cap it made him look like jim varney br br why would anyone spend four hours suffering through this br br watch the original then you won't have to ask yourself why,0
in the standard view this is a purely awful movie however it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale i can think of few actual comedies that make me laugh as hard as i did watching this movie andy griffith's ghost dressed in native american garb dancing sends me into hysterics everytime i wouldn't waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it but if you happen to be laying on the couch at 3 in the morning and it comes on tv check it out,0
in the beginning and throughout the movie it was great it was suspenseful and thrilling yet in the end it gave no answer to what had happened they mysteriously turned into zombies by a raven or crow it did not answer the questions that we all had and therefore was not as good a movie as i thought that it was going to be,0
i got this movie out of blockbuster in one of those racks were you can get like 5 movies for 20 bucks i'd have to say i got my money's worth on this one i had expected horrible dialogue crappy monsters and shaky cameras well as meatloaf said two outta three ain't bad br br the acting is bad though not as bad as some movies i've seen or maybe i've watched so many low budget movies recently i've lost perspective there are some bits were the acting is downright terrible but for the most part it's of at least high school play level br br the cg for the sasquatch in this movie is probably the second worst part the first thing i thought when i saw it and i noticed another reviewer agreed with me was that a man in an ape suit would have been better clunky stop motion animation would have looked better br br so you may be asking why i call the cg the second worst part that's because the very worst part of the movie is the sound effects they are loud annoying and constant i've been camping i know what insects sound like in the woods at night and while they can be loud they're not deafening like the cacophony in this movie usually when the background sounds drown out the movie's dialogue it's a bad thing but from what i caught of the dialogue of this film i wasn't missing much br br the action was infrequent and boring the tension was non existent as was any sense of empathy with the characters speaking of the characters they were all cookie cutter and bland the only mildly engaging byplay was between actually i can't think of anything there was a line or two that made me crack a wan smile but that was about it br br the cinematography was decent a step or two above what you'd normally see in a movie like this however it still had that home movie quality to it that you get with movies made on pocket change and a prayer br br if you're like me and get a kick out of shoestring budget genre flicks and you see this one in the dollar bin think about grabbing it otherwise stay away at all costs,0
i don't understand why the reviews of this film are so universally bad unless i'm just off my rocker i found it sick brilliant twisted and psychologically sophisticated you won't get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a hollywood film than this one it has layers within layers nuanced acting by stone and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it's over people need to get over the fact that sharon stone is 48 and that michael douglas isn't in this one i predict that this film will be a huge hit on dvd once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out give it a shot you might be glad you did,1
first off i'm not some justin timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good in fact i'm not even a huge justin fan but i did like this movie br br i work at a video store and when i saw this movie with its huge cast that i'd never even heard of i had to see what it was about i didn't find justin's acting that bad it was clearly the worst out of the group but it's a pretty impressive group with cary elwes and dylan mcdermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list the story is basic a journalist uncovering corrupt cops but i found it well done l l cool j's character was clearly conflicted but i honestly didn't know what he would do in the end morgan freeman is as always the wise mentor figure he does so well and as much as i love kevin spacey he was kind of just there his character didn't have a whole lot of substance but it's kevin spacey he can do no wrong br br surprisingly i thought dylan mcdermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop truly believable and really in character he freaked me out a couple of times br br i was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest horrible catchphrases unjustified action sequences stuff like that but it was surprisingly well done and i didn't find any of that every shooting had a point it wasn't clichéd pretty solid really br br overall amazing cast decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump i don't know why it didn't appear in theatres it was better than some garbage i've seen on the big screen i would say it's worth seeing,1
first of all in defense of joan fontaine it must be said that ginger rogers would have been terribly miscast as alyce the young british lady who has the title role fontaine makes a fetching picture as the heroine here but her acting inexperience shows badly and her dancing is better left unmentioned fortunately she went on to better things br br but here it's fred astaire george burns and gracie allen who get the top billing and they are excellent fans of burns allen will be surprised at how easily they fit into astaire's dance routines especially interesting is the big fun house routine that won choreographer hermes pans an oscar they join astaire in what has to be the film's most inventive highlight br br unfortunately not much can be said for the slow pacing of the story nor some of the stale situations which call for a lot of patience from the viewer it must be said that some of the humor falls flat and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any fred astaire film of this period are given conventional treatment only the musical interludes give the story the lift it needs br br some pleasant gershwin tunes pop up once in awhile but not all of them get the treatment they deserve the nice supporting cast includes reginald gardiner at his best in a polished comic performance as a conniving servant constance collier and montagu love as joan's father mistaken as a gardener by astaire br br it's a lighthearted romp whenever burns allen are around to remind us how funny they were in their radio and television days both of them are surprisingly adept in keeping up with astaire's footwork br br director george stevens makes sure that joan fontaine's hillside dance number with fred is filmed at a discreet distance but clever camera work cannot disguise the fact that she is out of her element as astaire's dance partner something she seems painfully aware of,1
scott henderson alan curtis is unjustly accused of killing his unfaithful wife the night she was murdered he was out with a mystery woman who refused to give him her name after accused of the murder the police visit all the places he had been with her but people only remember him being alone he's sentenced to die and his secretary ella raines sets out to find the murderer herself because she loves him br br this was made as a b film from universal look at the cast all character actors and one star franchot tone on the decline the budget was small and the cast mostly unknown but what came out is one of the best film noirs of the 1940s it's beautifully directed by curt siodmak and has a fantastic script that came from an excellent book by william irish a pen name for cornell woolrich it moves quickly and just looks fantastic and there's the infamous jam session with raines and elisha cook jr which just comes off the screen with incredible sexual energy i'm surprised the censors didn't cut it br br there are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect tone gives a dreadful performance he looks ghastly and he's just horrible also curtis is stiff and bland as henderson you really wonder why raines loves him he's so unemotional but raines is pretty good in the lead role she's pretty and full of life also the last scene when the murderer is after her never rings true he's hardly a threat physically and her reactions just seem overstated br br still i'm giving this a 9 a really great film flaws aside,1
predictable parody just about failed to impress throughout it's looooooong eight minutes the only thing that made it worthwhile was the do not colorize line at the end credits shame something more entertaining wasn't put on the dvd like jonathan ross' enjoyable profile of romero on 'the incredible strange film show ',0
when i first saw this film in the 1980's i was in my middle teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since i considered myself grown up and out of the sesame street muppets age i honestly don't remember if i liked it at the time or not however somewhere in college i watched this film again and it wound up going and staying into my personal best films ever collection br br this film is loaded with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the muppets i mean obviously the muppets always have appealed to adults and children because there's humor geared towards both generations but come on janice is accidentally overheard telling someone i don't take my clothes off for anyone even if it is artistic there's a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with kermit the frog then the father doesn't want to hear it gonzo saves a chicken with mouth to mouth resuscitation sp and afterwards says i think we're engaged now these and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling add to that very smart dialogue very smart new york broadway wink wink humor the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that don't border on kid level cheesy whatsoever this film is a masterpiece i don't throw 10 's out on a regular basis but this one deserves it over 20 years later this film totally holds up perhaps even more so the muppets never were and never will be again as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is q,1
'ninteen eighty four' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted it is a very dark film and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself it is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self centred the film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours contrasting with happiness and bright colours in the dreams and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places however despite the film's cleverness at portraying this idea the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across it seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling a story,0
ten out of ten stars is no exaggeration this documentary provides the viewers with unique footage about the 2003 coup in venezuela this great film is now the minimum knowledge requirement if you want to express a competent opinion about venezuela or hugo chavez br br the dramatic electrified atmosphere the unique footage will allow you to experience a true historic moment you'll feel like you're in the middle of the situation br br the film will help you gain unique insight in the happenings of 2003 and will help you hear a side you will rarely hear on tv it's something you shouldn't miss,1
my name is heather and i am the girl whose story this movie was based on i want to thank all of you who saw this movie and enjoyed it as crude and harsh as some of the things that were depicted in this movie were it didn't really even come close to describing how bad things actually were not to mention the affect everything had on my mother and little sister thanks once again for the great comments that everyone had i truly appreciate them br br hi everyone br br this is heather's mom it's hard to believe that so many years have gone by since this movie was made harder even to believe that people were still watching it a year ago for any of you out there who have gone thru the same or similar kind of situation please know that there are people out here in cyberspace that do understand completely how you feel our thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you,1

a dreary and pointless bit of fluff bloody fluff but fluff badly scripted with inane and wooden dialogue you do not care if the characters indeed even if the actors themselves live or die little grace or charm little action little point to the whole thing perhaps some of the set and setting will interest those gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived the framework encounter is unnecessary and distracting and the hoppalong cassidy character himself is both boring and inept,0
in the first 20 minutes every cliche possible was trotted out by the hack writer and director there was the ntsb primary investigator with the tortured family life the politically tortured ntsb board member played by i can kill any tv ted mcginley the tortured father of a crash victim and the torturing sleazy ambulance chasing lawyer br br hollywood still has no concept of the fragility of aircraft the crashed plane was a 737 and it was mostly sitting on the ground like a hippo who decided to take a nap the first third of the fuselage was intact the rear half of the plane was intact and the debris field showed no wings or engines most of the people should have walked away in light of how many people survived that plane that got shredded in iowa after it lost its hydraulics most of this tv plane wasn't even burned br br it reminded me of the scene in air force one where the 747 hits the water and then skips along like it's made of inch thick steel br br the show was so bad it was impossible to watch even my wife who is more accepting than i was commenting on technical flaws what had me stunned was how this pos could ever get made are the producers of these things so used to clichés that they can't even recognize them somebody read this script and said yes i want to spend a million bucks making this real i wish i was the guy's next appointment i have title to a wonderful bridge in new york that i'd sell cheap,0
at least the seats in the theater were comfortable and i ate the pop corn as loud as possible to drown out the inferior dialogue this is absolutely not a girls film any blokes who like it are the ones us ladies can be sure to stay far away from dumb story mediocre dialogue and an overall cheap looking film i've seen many many movies but this one is the new winner in the bad category if you do happen to see it the one thing you'll look forward to is the ending so you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can,0
this was a typical grade b movie in 1940s hollywood and yet it succeeded way beyond its expectations why it has a wonderful plot and backed up by nina foch george macready and dame may witty as a female villain of all people br br when a young lady answers an advertisement for a secretary she certainly gets more than she bargained for the only talents her employers are seeking are those which will lead to her demise seems that witty and macready want to pass her off as their daughter in law and wife respectively macready killed his real wife and wants to do foch in as well so that a body can be claimed br br the film deals with how foch tries to get town people to believe her and how she is thwarted in practically everything she does why don't people believe her,1
i haven't seen this don't plan to see this movie or any other that includes lindsay unless until poor little rich girl straightens out her life for a 2 year period beginning with her most recent arrest in july 2007 br br in fact i don't know anyone that has gone to see any of lindsay's recent movies i rather imagine 2007 will be the high water mark in her movie making career until she cleans up her act all of the recent publicity has only hindered her movie making career if she has any further aspirations to make any more movies br br up to this time movie producers have actively sought lindsay for roles in their upcoming production now lindsay will probably have to go to auditions actually compete for any role her reputation is currently poison quite possible could have a negative effect on box office ticket sales on any movie she is in br br sooooo now lindsay is going to have to deal with not being wanted is she going to be able to handle this br br i wonder if even jay leno will want to have lindsay back on his tv show br br all of the foregoing is merely my opinion i have no inside information,0
warning spoilers following superb recreation of the base in antarctica where the real events of the film took place other than that libelous scandalous filmed in canada presumably by a largely canadian crew and cast i caught the last half of this film recently on global television here in canada nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled i was at what a blatant piece of american historical revisionist propaganda it is and starring susan sarandon of all people i can only assume that canadian born director roger spottiswoode was coerced to make the usaf the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in calgary kenn borek air,0
a horror movie is being shot and things aren't going well it's about a masked killer the director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew he goes crazy and kills two people he's killed himself and the film is never finished twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish it but there's a curse people who try and finish it are killed themselves the students ignore that guess what happens next br br the plot is old hat but this isn't bad for what it is a low budget slasher film it's well made with a young and fairly talented young cast no one is great but no one is terrible either it also avoids the obligatory and needless female nude scenes it moves quickly the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesn't insult your intelligence also molly ringwald is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actress br br no great shakes but not bad at all i give it a 7,1
i think that this film is brilliant there are many reasons why but these are some of them 1 the good acting by tom and tyler 2 brilliant machine gun scene that was a piece of brilliance 3 i thought that the ending was a good twist because i never expected that at the end all credit to sam mendes as well as a these 3 points the film form of the film is good as well i am a film student at college and we studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films i have seen in many years i'd just like to say a big thank you to all of the people involved in making this film lastly i would like to say the best scene in the film is the machine gun scene where john rooney gets kill it is just pure brilliance in shooting the scene in silence until john rooney says i'm glad it's you it is a lot better like that i think because the viewer creates there own sound and that sound is totally different for every viewer just brilliant br br thank you for reading this comment written by ross kirk aged 16,1
i love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this one but this film is static never mind the production value which is very noble for its budget but the pacing is deadly admittedly these folks achieve much with little but the film fails on the most fundamental level it's boring the editing is glacial and the pacing stalls it should have been 65 minutes the best thing about the dr jekyll is mr hyde who isn't seen nearly enough he had the most dramatic potential instead we have to suffer through dithering baltimorean brits stammer through endless and tiresome exposition it feels like a backwater stage play committed to video br br noble efforts by everyone in the production but a story this tired needed a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should have given it a fresh voice instead it's just a lame retread,0
by 1976 the western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it still instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch it they went ahead and made it anyway apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film they decided to make it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible hell it worked for the wild bunch so why shouldn't it work here of course the wild bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of the last hard men is plain old fashioned rubbish br br it's hard to figure out what attracted charlton heston and james coburn to their respective roles heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw coburn the hunt becomes even more personal when heston's daughter barbara hershey is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation br br this is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over the top detail it's tremendously disappointing really because the star pairing sounds like a mouth watering prospect there's no sense of pace or urgency in the film either it takes an eternity to get going but when the action finally does come it is marred by the emphasis on nastiness all in all this might be the very worst film that heston ever made i'm sure it's one of the productions he is loathe to include on his illustrious cv,0
yes he is no not because of pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies pintilie is the naked emperor so to speak br br it's big time for someone to state the truth this impostor is a voyeur a brat locked in an old man's body his abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever it is 100 visual perversion he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies and if he does this in front of the audience he might eve get a hard on did you know that on the set of niki ardelean he used to embarrass poor coca bloss by telling her oh coca how i wanna f you she is a great lady very decent and sensitive and she became unspeakably ashamed to his petty satisfaction and as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in romanian audiences so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities works of art will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all,0
i have very fond memories of this film as i saw it with my two younger sisters when it first shown theatrically in 1977 and i was eight years old apparently it was deemed a failure and is now practically forgotten the pan and scan videocassette which never did justice to the picture or it's ambitious panavision compositions is now out of print the film is very stylized shades of yellow submarine and admittedly uneven some of the characters and sequences are exquisite while others are somewhat juvenile and undistinguished the sad discarded blue camel shades of eeyore and his blue song are truly heartwarming joe raposo's songs are for the most part simply beautiful definitely a worthwhile curiousity that will probably sadly fall into total obscurity,1
one of hung's better early efforts the humor is dead on in parts as hung tries to imitate lee's moves and facial expressions and also in a bit where hung pokes fun at jackie chan's drunken master the action is also pretty good especially when hung takes on a trio on martial arts experts at the end it's not the greatest film but pretty good for '70's kung fu especially if you're a fan of hung and or lee be warned though most video versions of the movie have pretty shoddy quality there is also a character in blackface which some people might find offensive br br sammo hung is a rural swine herder who moves to hong kong to fight off some bad guys sammo turns on his dead on bruce lee impersonation when fighting br br this film is often billed as a parody of bruce lee's enter the dragon but it's not exactly that sammo is a rural swine herder obsessed with bruce lee who moves to hong kong to help his relatives run a small open air restaurant once situated at the new job he is forced to defend the eatery from local gangsters looking for protection money when sammo switches into fighting mode he switches on his bruce lee impersonation which must be seen to be believed this film is pretty sloppy in many of the fight scenes sammo battles against people who are obviously actors rather than martial artists and there's one character who's supposed to be black who is played by an asian man in heavy and preposterous makeup but what this film lacks in budget and accuracy it more than makes up for in atmosphere and energy highly recommended for a good mood,1
japan 1918 the story of 16 year old ryu begins with the death of her father as it will be revealed later both of her parents have died of tuberculosis in this desperate situation ryus aunt has arranged a marriage with a japanese man in hawai whom they know only from its picture by her arrival in hawai ryu discovers that her new husband is much older as in the photograph and that he lives in very humble circumstances beside a sugar cane plantage were he works on ryu not used to the hard labour on the plantage and in despair over her situation in her new home thinks of running away she soon discovers that she has nowhere to go the friendship to kana a female co worker of hers gives her new hope and strength this picture is based on real events between 1907 and the 1920s when thousands of asian woman were married off to men in america whom they only knew from their picture this not very well known picture is well written and acted the location is breathtaking this film also features mifune toshiro in his very last screen appearance as a benshi narrator of silent movies this film gives some insight of japanese culture here and across the ocean a must see,1
in the first one it was mainly giant rats but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too this one however is just giant rats period well giant rats and one really growing little boy this one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats you know how it is this movie has some kills and its moments but i find it to be on par with the original i just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies well that is not true i actually like empire of the ants maybe i just do not care for giant rodents all in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre i just can't recommend this one,0
i admit it's very silly but i've practically memorized the damn thing it holds a lot of good childhood memories for me my brother and i saw it opening day and i have respect for any movie with fnm on the soundtrack,1
the only kung fu epic worth watching the best training ever the main character spending a hundred day's on his knees outside the shaolin temple show how desperate he is to learn kung fu to fight the manchu dogs who have taken over china,1
yes i'll admit it i believed all the hype surrounding this piece of work about the trials and tribulations of 6 people living in mexico city concerning their sexual lives and so i was really expecting to finally see a mexican movie in ages that was both popular and interesting to watch unfortunately the film was utterly disappointing the story presents us with two couples both with very obvious marital problems when a third party comes into the life of each couple their problems reach a pivotal point or absolute absurd the plot then turns into a battle of the sexes the stance taken by each group yes they literally group girls with girls and boys with boys is blatantly stupid and childish i guess the humor was supposed to be there and it all goes from bad to worse the performances range from good miss zavaleta to mediocre mr bichir with serrano doing an acceptable job on his opera prima however the flat circumstances that make up the plot the one dimensional characters the very poor if not stupid perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship etc make the movie fail miserably spyl has had an impressive good reception at the box office believe the hype at your own risk,0
this could be a strong candidate for the worst flick ever perhaps without the presence of john hurt it could be tolerated as a kid film however the tragedy of this entire endeavor is that john hurt one of the screen's greatest actors diminishes himself in this i gave it two points just because mr hurt showed up i take away 8 points because he didn't run from it fast enough as far as the rest of the cast they are simply terrible janine turner as pretty as she might be cannot act to save her soul and the lead actor is for all intents and purposes awful if you can spare yourself this embarrassment please do so it's so bad it almost hurts,0
this was awful andie macdowell is a terrible actress so wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job but then remember that turn in four weddings equally as excruciating another film that portrays england as full of chocolate box cottages and village greens i mean that school how many schools apart from maybe hogwarts look like that the twee police station looked like the set from heartbeat a nauseating british series set in the 60s this film just couldn't make its mind up what it wanted to be a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women's friendships if it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked i say just but those scenes just didn't work with the tragedy in the second half i also find it implausible that kate would ever speak to molly again after her terrible behaviour a final note what is a decent actress like staunton doing in this pile of poo not to mention anna chancellor macdowell should stick to advertising wrinkle cream,0
this movie re wrote film history in every way no one cares what anyone thinks about this movie because it transcends criticism every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it it is an extremely beautiful movie and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again i've seen it more times than i care to count and i still become transfixed every time with a feeling which is hard to describe one for the ages,1
i have to admit i've caught this one a few times on the usa network there's just something about the well sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever it's on yes you're right about the sub par acting the plot which only an seven year old could like etc but i can't help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors then again a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel,0
show favorites green arrow introduced this season aquaman introduced in season 5 impulse season 4 and cyborg season 5 all come together along with clark to stop one of lex's evil plans in this thrilling mid season episode br br through his sophisticated technology green arrow learns that lex luthor is constructing laboratories across the world that hold people induced by the meteor substance kryptonite and people with abilities to run tests on green arrow over the past months has allied arthur curry aqua bart allen impulse and victor stone cyborg to stop lex and destroy these facilities after recruiting clark to help the team puts on quite a show in interrogating and destroying a local laboratory br br this episode is incredible full of action humor and fabulous dialog it feels more like a movie it is full of entertainment and provides as a springboard for the most interesting storyline of the sixth season,1
i saw this movie when it was new later i rented it in japan after having been here three years afraid that i would cringe when i viewed it in the harsh light of my expanded international experience the movie pleasantly surprised me with how accurately it portrays the culture clash between japan and pennsylvania where i'm from not all the stuff is factually spot on but the tone is perfect br br i'm still in japan many years later and i continue to enjoy this film for its even handed treatment of the two sides in the story interestingly although the japanese american actors spoke japanese in the original the dialog is redubbed in the japan version to cover up obvious second language delivery problems br br i noticed one reviewer uses this in a japanese class i think you can learn more about what to expect from an encounter with japan by watching this film than by reading any of the serious books on the matter most of which were written in the 80s and financed by propagandizing japanese companies br br don't be fooled by drag on the average rating caused by one star reviewers who among other things found it implausible that the japanese would want to build cars in the us of course the japanese operate many factories there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade friction this is a very warm and funny movie that i would rate higher were it not for a few 80s clichés like the dancing around to cheesy electronic disco music michael keaton has never been funnier,1
this has to be one of my favourite movies of all time the dialogue with the constant use of puns is very tight the cast are superb and the plot is highly original br br don't take my word for it watch this movie and enjoy it for yourself,1
this is possibly the most boring movie in history i was really looking forward to seeing this movie given the actor director roman polanski i think i would rather see the three amigos than ever watch this movie again it promptly went from the dvd player straight into the garbage my apologies to those of you who apparently liked this movie however you probably liked new coke as well i am at a loss to see why anyone would have enjoyed this movie it is slow dull and has no real plot you wait for 105 minutes for the movie to get started i understand this was made in 1976 however this was an era of bad television all around thank god disco and three's company are gone along with stop sign glasses and the bay city rollers oh well just my thoughts,0
we toss around the term superstar way too lightly these days but here's one guy that truly deserves it br br i was glued to the set this entire show the song selection was perfect it only contained the songs i actually wanted to hear and cut in with documentary footage during the weaker new songs i loved that the band was just a five guys on stage in a very minimalist environment with songs of this strength you don't need a circus to be entertained br br the shots of the crowd were amazing too how many performers can affect the original beatles fans now in their 50's and beyond get young kids to jump up at the opening lines of can't buy me love and impact everyone in between br br while watching i also realized that in the wake of john lennon's tragic death paul mccartney instantly became an afterthought paul not only lost john and george no matter what their final relations were it must be hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world but he also lost his wife linda and never really seemed to garner the acknowledgment lennon's murder received i agree that lennon's murder was horrible but only now did i realize that paul was sort of forgotten in the aftermath i was very happy that he's found love again in heather br br as for those complaining about the audio video quality i had no complaints whatsoever both were crystal clear on my set i think these same people will complain about the quality of dvd when the next format comes out they'll never be satisfied br br my only regret was not buying a ticket to this show when i had the chance thanks to this video i was able to enjoy it br br when people remember john lennon they will first remember his murder and then his music i now have a new appreciation for paul mccartney because if nothing else he will be remembered for his music first and let's hope another lunatic won't change this because the mccartney catalog is pretty good,1
this is not my favorite wip women in prison but it is one of the most famous films in the sub genre it is was produced by roger corman who at this point had already produced a few wips it is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula the movie takes place in an usa prison not in a banana republic like most wip films i'm not sure if that was a wise move but it is an acceptable change of pace writer director demme really gets into his job always digging for new ways to present a familiar scenario in fact he is a little too ambitious for his own good the filmmaker creates a few surreal dream sequences that are borderline pretentious but it is fun to see how hard he tries to put this film above your average chicks in chains flick but do not worry demme still operates within the parameters of the sub genre there is plenty of nudity and violence something that will satisfy hardcore fans the film is a little slow but it is very entertaining the cast is good roberta collins is a wip veteran so she does not need an introduction and barbara steel is a hoot as the wheelchair bound crazy warden pam grier is sorely missed though,1
this movie is traditional bollywood fare as far as the star power sentimentality and love triangle of emotions what really bothered me about this movie was the makers' absurd notion of surrogate mother a whore who conceives a child with someone after have sex with the man of the family desiring a child is not a surrogate mother neither is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother i have seen indian movies and television shows that made 10 to 15 years ago that dealt with this issue more intelligently the whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and absolutely implausible i realize that most bollywood movies aren't meant to be plausible but they don't pretend to be either this movie wants us to emote along with the characters but this can't done with such a ridiculous contrived conflict i would have expected better from abbas and mustan,0
one of those why was this made movies the romance is very hard to swallow it is one of those romances that suddenly click they are in love the movie is filled with long pauses and uncomfortable moments the drive in restaurant being the most notable charles grodin does a credible job but for most of the movie it's just him and louise lasser ask yourself do you want to watch grodin with his neurosis and lasser with her neurosis together for a hour and half,0
in addition to being an extremely fun movie may i add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful this kind fun loving woman had a great deal of money unfortunately she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money this woman was lonely since the death of her husband he had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down to prevent that she bought it her daughters were afraid she was throwing away their money and decided to take action the character actors in this film were a great plus also i would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library but as of yet it's never been released sad,1
channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any of the other channels this show was certainly a naughty one the presenter of this sometimes gross adult chat show four time bafta winning and british comedy award winning also twice nominated graham norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this it had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it they basically had an adult idea which would either gross humiliate or humour the guest but some are not for the faint hearted they had women playing the recorder with their parts men using their dicks to play a xylophone women weeing upwards in the bath men with or without pants under their kilts and many more gross but hilarious ideas this is just for adults but enjoy it it won the bafta twice for best entertainment programme or series it won the british comedy awards for best comedy entertainment programme also nominated best comedy talk show it won an emmy for episode 18 and it won the national television awards twice for most popular talk show it was number 52 on the 100 greatest funny moments very good,1
this is a good movie a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do if you are expecting this movie to be word to word from the book you will be very very disappointed i was somewhat disappointed because i read the book a few times when i was in elementary school br br this is about a new kid in town named billy he makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets billy has to eat 10 worms in one day or the bully wins br br the acting is ok probably the worst part of the movie the kid actors over exaggerate on many things they think it's apocalypse if billy does not eat the worms hallie eisenberg did a magnificent job though br br the plot line is good as a movie but it sucks as a book adaptation i was able to watch this movie without looking at the time sometimes br br overall this was a good family movie with some weak points i rate this movie 7 10,1
does anything at all happen in this movie there are only the bizarre short scenes where i didn't know what the hell was going on so that doesn't count this movie is sooo boring it hurts and this is coming from a person who likes it when movies are about making movies confused well i was after watching this crap what was donald sutherland on because he missed it with this one completely and what's with the pedofile scene at the beginning of the movie can put anyone to sleep 4 10,0
i as a teenager really enjoyed this movie mary kate and ashley worked great together and everyone seemed so at ease i thought the movie plot was very good and hope everyone else enjoys it to be sure and rent it also they had some great soccer scenes for all those soccer players,1
this could have been interesting  a japan set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly installed american family  but falls flat due to an over simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director br br the film suffers from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare i e the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they're expected to besides it doesn't deliver much in the scares department  a giant crab attack is merely silly  as generally the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way such as susan george seducing diplomat friend of the family doug mcclure and edward albert force feeding his daughter a bowl of soup br br at one point an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually he's called upon to exorcise the premises however history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which albert and mcclure possessed by the spirits of their japanese predecessors engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death at the end of the day this emerges an innocuous time waster  tolerable at just 88 minutes but in no way essential viewing,0
this movie gets both a 6 10 rating from me as well as a 9 10 here is why as a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd where action and gore and scares are taken into consideration this movie will bore you it's basically a family drama similar to what you'd see on the lifetime channel but put in a horror universe the story and formula are age old retreaded hundreds of times if you're looking for any originality in the plot structure or the minimal conflicts you'll be disappointed take away the zombies and you'll have something just as melodramatic as a beautiful mind tripping on cheese this is the 6 10 br br however the basic synopsis and idea is pretty original and over the top it's literally something you and your friends would joke about when you're half drunk but that joke actually got a theatrical release the idea gets a 9 10 from me the only reason it isn't perfect is because they could have taken it even further but they didn't br br the mix of both is mixed i thought it was funny but as with most all comedies it wasn't that funny i had my mom and little sister watch it with me and the jokes we made about it were funnier than the jokes scripted there were moments of utter genius but there were also moments of pure boredom br br i sincerely hope that other movies take this kind of over the top risk and original ideas i just can't say it was perfect or even near it because of the lack of originality to the plot br br a great family movie a great movie to watch with a bunch of guys or girls a great movie to watch with anyone but if you watch it alone it will be a bit boring other people always make this kind of movie funnier and richer br br 4 10,0
br br i have to admit to enjoying bad movies i love them i watch all of them horror especially my friends and i all gather after a hard week at school and work rent some crazy tapes order a pizza and have a blast one of the ones we got at hollywood video was this one zombie bloodbath this one had a great box so i was expecting less than usual br br the story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above ground layers bulldozed and the other underground layers are simply covered up the inhabitants of this neighborhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave this wakes up some zombies br br from this point on it's chunk city the gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll br br ok it's not great art but this one with it's in joke dialogue and over the top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening actually it was one of the best party tapes i have ever had the pleasure of watching and you could tell it was done on no money with a bunch of crazy people there are hundreds of zombies and the director looks like brendan frazer he has a cameo and it is just a wild trip,1
i don't know much about film making but good movies have to tell some sort of a story your characters have to start and complete their journey in last exit to brooklyn they may but its not in any satisfying way and i'm not meaning a happy ending just any ending br br last exit to brooklyn set in 1952 brooklyn during a very brutal labor strike sets a number of story threads in motion most involve some of the most unlikeable characters to ever walk across a movie screen but last exit to brooklyn fails to bring these stories to any conclusion it leaves some of them dangling with no ending or blasts off into some bizarre stratosphere for an artistic ending br br two cases in point and they contain spoilers br br a sad transvestite character an important character in the film is struck by a car and killed and that's it for him in the movie he's gone for good erased from everyone's memory no reactions from his friends enemies lovers nothing br br in another thread the stupid clueless and secretly gay strike leader having been rejected by labor his gay lover and found out by the neighborhood thugs gets stomped by the thugs the closing scene to the beating shows the streets of brooklyn and the streetlights are very very similar to those of nazi death camps and the scene drags on and on and on and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader and he's been crucified ppppuuuulllleeeeeez and of course that's it for him too brain erasure gone br br bottom line no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this film this movie is a depressing piece of sludge avoid it and if you don't be forewarned it really deserves an nc 17 rating for massive amounts of physical emotional and sexual brutality don't even let the teenagers watch,0
a guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus she refuses him but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway and there it starts a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero it can't be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic br br in short a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film and imo it succeeds at being a nice film it's no masterpiece but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is even with the superhero thing going believable br br so thin story but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time br br 7 out of 10 broken hearts,1
tess of the storm country was a mary pickford vehicle i had intended to get for some time i finally found a vhs copy for a reasonable price and got to enjoy it br br mary gives her typical spunky innocently sexy portrayal of a wrong side of tracks girl who wins the heart of a rich heir only this time the stakes are higher a false murder charge an illegitimate child and ensuing case of mistaken motherhood and contemplated suicide br br one can see why pickford wanted to redo this one the story is a real morality tale the kind that she loved to star in the controversial topics aren't always spelled out plainly a viewer has to pay attention and pick up on hints to catch everything that is being implied on first viewing  although everything is more or less explained in the end br br about the only negative remark i can make would be concerning jean hersholt and the dog hersholt whose character ben letts looks to be about 6 2 200 pounds bigger next to mary of course is sent fleeing in panic when a 60 pound chocolate lab charges toward him then to top it off or maybe to justify his perplexing fear of the dog it manages to pin him to the ground and somehow injures him so badly that he is still struggling to get up much later as a bad storm hits this is the same lovable lab that sleeps with frederick lloyd hughes and cuddles with mary yet mary later throws boiling water in ben's face which barely slows him ok i've vented about ben and the chocolate lab other than that the movie was quite touching and certainly held my attention pickford's supporting cast was strong and believable this is certainly among her better films,1
mirage 1990 is a very rare horror chiller from 1990 released here in the uk on the new world video label br br it's a desert based horror film about a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend only to be killed off one by one by an unknown force who drives a menacing black truck this film has some creepy scenes and some gore here and there but i have to say that the acting was so lame even by low budget standards but the film was oddly addictive and i liked it and i never fell asleep or turned it off which is always a good sign i nearly gave this movie 6 10 but seeing as it built up steam along the way had some good moments of gore and suspense had some good nudity and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was a hottie too i'll give it 7 10,1
i saw this film and heard the writer director juan gerard speak at the santa barbara int'l film festival br br all i knew about it was that it was the story of an 8 year old boy at the time of the cuban revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family br br its opening scene will bring to mind cinema paradiso in fact the film is filled with references to classic films the roulette wheel casablanca chicken clucking rebel without a cause references to bunuel touch of evil you'll find more the homeless man georg stanford brown is a reference to cuban folklore which often uses a black man as a type of greek chorus br br what this film really is is the culmination of a dream gerard's wish to honor his family and medium of film that he has loved all of his life br br this is the true story of juan gerard and all the people in it are real as are the events depicted gerard is actually an architect and engineer and passionate film lover but his dream was to make this movie he and his wife decided to live that dream and harvey keitel became an angel who believed in gerard and agreed to produce and star in it keitel holds the screen powerfully as the mysterious and secretive grandfather che brown and keitel are the only americans in the cast iben hjejle high fidelity and gael garcia bernal y tu mama tambien offer strong support in key roles br br truthfully the first half of the film suffers from stiff delivery of lines and some overracting but stay with it the last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet and honest climax it is the first effort of juan gerard but it is honest as he is and his passion and heart really come through in this sincere first effort i would definitely see it again and hope that he continues his film career br br,1

american playwright howard w campbell jr played with a musty obsolescence by nick nolte lives happily in germany with his actress wife helga noth sheryl lee before the beginning of world war ii at the peak of his life howard is drafted by an american agent john goodman to become a spy on behalf of the allies forewarned of the risks the job holds howard has everything to lose but finds the offer irresistible following the death of his wife and the end of the war campbell camouflages himself with the anonymity of a solitary life in new york city which muddies his neuroses even further the central question indeed a question that has frustrated many critics of the movie and kurt vonnegut's source novel is is campbell a hero or a traitor director keith gordon and screenwriter robert b weide offer us clues but no answer and this ambiguitythis not knowingis what keeps mother night fresh and interesting throughout at the beginning of the film nolte portrays campbell as intelligent and confident by the end he's either scared and uncertain or scared and completely certain of his contribution debt to humanity for the role he played in the war gordon applies a certain icy sheen to the images of the film's first half which complement his portrait of the nazi bourgeoisie and captures vonnegut's dramatic side on the flip side when campbell is confined to his lonely new york apartment which he affectionately calls purgatory only to be discovered by a group of nazis the humor produced also is purely distinctive of the author and provides a temporary respite from the dramatic tension that unfolds the moral even spiritual paradox mother night presents doesn't lend itself to simple resolution and to a degree should be left ambiguousthe black and white scenes of campbell staring wearily into space as he is imprisoned in israel suggest an unspoken contemplation we are not made privy toas campbell is a character whose inner workings we wind up knowing very little about the war changes him coming back to america changes him and meeting up with the nazis in new york compels him to prolong the facade of his act even further to the point where he can only stare wearily at an image of himself projected on a wall spewing anti semitic bile perhaps that's the best reaction we could hope for,1

i saw this film again and noticed how close it is to the novel if we ignore the part about cary's leslie howard childhood considering that br br at the time not much can be shown on the screen not that there is much in the novel the obsession of the character with mildred bette davis is very well conveyed to the audience i recommend this film to anyone who ever fell for another person and the other side tried to take advantage of him or her i have read that maugham was asked to make a recording of the novel for sale but when he started to in the studio he began crying and could not finish more than a few lines and whole project was chucked one can tell the novel is written from the heart and the film is a good br br adaptation of a part of it at least,1
i saw this at the theater in the early 1970's the most memorable and scary scene is when the german army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time the germans and their horses are covered from head to toe or hoof with eerie protective suits the experienced british soldiers don gas masks only and once again await the clouds of gas and the german attackers the gas clouds move ever closer finally enveloping the british defenders the germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb suddenly a scream from the defenders this gas is like no other that they have experienced before br br now you will know why i have remembered this scene for the last 30 years and still shiver i think that you will too,1
this very strange movie is unlike anything made in the west at the time with its tumultuous emotions and net of visions dreams and startling images its effect is both beautiful and unsettling the actors are choreographed more like dance than acting it contains the only dream sequence i know of that actually resembles a real nightmare sorry dali fans,1
although robert knox benfer has his fans i'm not one of them his films are asinine and amateurish and and just not very funny unless you're a 14 year old with an underdeveloped sense of humor br br he's certainly not famous as him immature fans would like you to believe by harassing people at wikipedia or stuffing the ratings votes here at the imdb he's certainly not been profiled by any major media outlets which speaks volumes about his and his creation's fame br br benfer does have some slight skill at limited animation but he needs to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write some actual funny material before he'll be taken seriously as a real entertainer as of this moment though he's just a kid with a camera and it shows,0
had i watched it in my teenage years this movie was mildly entertaining what i liked about soul survivors were the gothic atmosphere during the party scenes and the constant flips between 'dream' and 'reality br br had there not been movies like 'the 6th sense' and 'don't look now' i would have been surprised by the ending,0
this is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today's more hectic and loud films it is another solid based on a true store which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes frankly i don't know but i liked the story br br the story is about a young man back in the fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else including his father does in this west virginia town the big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father which i think was overdone i would like to have a little less tension between the two br br the young man still a boy is played by jake gyllenhaal one of his first staring assignments i think he's likable as are his school buddies in here it's nice to see nice kids in a modern day film the two other key actors in the movie are chris cooper the dad and laura dern the kid's teacher who encourages him all the time br br the cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear once again i wish there more of these kind of films made today,1
this animated movie is a masterpiece the narration music animation and storyline where all remarkable my girlfriend and i saw it again for a second time and we got more insight from it we invited a couple friends to see spirit with us and they really enjoyed it a lot when i asked them to come along to see it they thought it was a movie about horses but afterwards they realized it was more than that i liked esperanza spirit rain and lil' creek who reminds me of nathan chasing horse who is smiles a lot in dances with wolves spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that i found to be empowering and inspirational br br i saw spirit for a third time and i want to go see it again i enjoyed spirit tremendously because its portrayal of american indians is realistic dignified and non stereotypical unlike the movie the road to el dorado which was a total farce because it portrayed american indians in a disrespectful and stereotypical way but dreamworks has redeemed themselves by making spirit a great movie that i found to be acceptable i hope they continue to make more animated movies like spirit and i would like to see sequels or spinoffs to spirit if its done respectfully and without stereotyping american indians br br i highly recommend this to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see spirit stallion of the cimarron,1
yes i know i'm one of the few people longing to trample this movie into the dust of oblivion so let me me tell you why i feel this way in truth had it been advertized as a zombie film or the like i might have enjoyed it but right now i'm totally speechless br br spoiler though i'm not sure what's to spoil let's start with the first huge flaw if i did not know that the movie is called darkness the vampire version and had i not seen some sequences where some individuals seem to be sucking blood i would not have seen the connection with vampires i mean fangless give me a break br br second bad point what's with the metal it appears that all young people but mainly those so called vampires are into various kinds of metal judging mainly by their shirts don't get me wrong i've been into the more extreme forms of music for almost 15 years but nobody 's going to scare me by showing me some ridiculous teenagers in iron maiden of all bands t shirts running around pretending to be vampires pathetic is the only only word that i could use here br br third weakness the actors wait a minute what actors you mean the director's wooden friends words would be a waste here br br yes alright the movie is very gory but what difference does that make it would have been a strong point and something to enjoy if the briliant director had not chosen to create an artificial vampire topic in this movie i wanted to see vampires but was treated to some stupid looking kids i would have loved to use my baseball bat on the film makers should simply have advertized the movie saying cheap b grade horror with no plot but a lot of gore br br this movie is blasphemy against the whole concept of vampirism and it makes me sick,0
so i don't ruin it for you i'll be very brief there's some great acting and funny lines from the attractive cast a young graduate of harvard med school brian white finds out he doesn't know as much as he thinks about people he goes to a small hospital in florida for his internship because a girlfriend mya left him for a job as a tv producer his senior resident wood harris helped marvelously by his 'creative collaborator' zoe saldana bring him up to speed they help protect his career and show him the wider possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money as seems to be true for many of my pre med friends,1
first saw this gem from joe sarno way back when and i must say that after seeing it i could never forget jennifer welles at first i thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a sarno film but when jennifer made her entrance the first time i ever saw her anywhere i was sat up and took notice her presence in this film is hard to avoid and spices up every scene she's involved in i've seen most of the rest of sarno's films and the other films starring or featuring jennifer welles and i must say that this was both sarno and jennifer at their collective best sarno's direction in this film of domestic adult drama is superb and jennifer showed figuratively and literally an acting prowess that make this a must see co stars rebecca brooke aka mary mendum and chris jordan both frequent co stars of ms welles and also frequent stars of sarno's work turn in believable performances as a pair of adventurous yet normal housewives this film is sarno classic,1
in 1979 i was a boy of 12 years old my parents had just got the home box office which was pretty new to our neighborhood as a 12 year old boy this was the first time i saw boobs on television i will never forget the joy of those times racing vans the total ass wipe with the baddest van the water bed the smoking of herbs the hot 70's chicks the 'makin love in my chevy van song it was all so new to me a complete movie with all of the memories you could hope for i own it and enjoy it about once a year when i watch this movie it makes me want to get my skates with 4 wheels not in a strait line go to the park and hunt down some babes with feathered hair truly great memories of young adolescence,1
probably jackie chan's best film in the 1980s and the one that put him on the map the scale of this self directed police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes during which a squatters' village and shopping mall are demolished there are clearly differences between the original chinese and dubbed english versions with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter the latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their chinese originals in fact the only thing the dubbing has corrected is the court trialat the time trials in colonial hong kong were conducted in english while the original has this scene in cantonese br br nonetheless chan's fighting style and the martial arts choreography inject humour where possible so non cantonese audiences don't miss much it's not after all the dialogue that makes a chan flick but the action and the painful out takes the story is easy to follow chan plays an incorruptible hong kong detective pursuing a gangland godfather cho yeun and assigned to protect a star witness brigitte lin the action is superb from beginning to end and there's not much time to breathe in between it'll never get you thinking but what an entertaining and well strung together film arguably this is one of the best martial arts films out there,1
i give this marriage 3 years and thats stretching it adrianne curry is fouled mouth spoiled controlling loud and her bi sexual past makes me laugh she tells chris he has an image to protect and must avoid strip clubs he married her chris has low self esteem and from a different time warp i have nothing against adrianne curry but this combination is not gonna have a happy ever after ending her mother said he was an old rooster and thinks this is his last attempt to recapture his youth here 2 very good people who are gonna end up in a nasty divorce i don't think his old brady family is gonna fit into his new life i see them being shut out chris said his friends were more important than his family the supported him and was there for him,0
i've never been huge on imax films they're cool but once you get over that initial rush of whoa it feels like flying the movies themselves are usually pretty corny and ordinary br br the exceptions have been the powerful everest the exhilarating wild california and now the bbc's the human body a super sized look at the insides of our bodies br br our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply inconceivable this 50 minute film could be 10 hours long and still wouldn't get to all of the systems working in tandem just as i type this review and listen to my radio and most of us take it all for granted br br here you can see the inside of a pumping heart looks like an alien spaceship the inside of your lungs the tiny hairs in your eardrum that process sound the development of a baby inside a mother's womb and surprisingly a few of the um less attractive functions that i thought it would shy away from pimples the churning of acids in the stomach br br this film also has a rather funky style to it which sets it apart from other imax documentaries for instance we've all seen sperm finding its way to the egg but have you ever seen it set to the tune of marvin gaye's let's get it on it's creative moments like that that make the human body not just a health lesson but fun as well,1
or marlowe at sea yet another ridiculously overrated old film with bogey quite talky too bogey basically plays the same character as in the marlow films always in control of a situation never nervous no matter how dangerous a situation calls women slim and dames and other such nonsense is the only real male i e alpha male in the movie the only other alpha male male being the head of gestapo but he is only a fat alpha male male and naturally every attractive young woman who comes his way cannot resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction the character clichés are all here bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynic about to reform as in casablanca and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him it doesn't so he can't be a cynic hawks wanted it both ways a character who is both the cool lone cynic and yet a well meaning humanitarian i don't think so bacall does her non chalant cool babe routine for the first time and there are plenty of overrated not all too interesting so called sexual innuendo exchanges between her and bogey these dialogues sound silly by today's standards just purse your lips and whistle a load of crap she was 19 when this was made but looks a lot older and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day her bony face with its sharp features is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de havilland the cuteness of a myrna loy let alone the likability of an irene dunne bacall was more suited for playing vampires not femme fatales in real life she is very much like her face a hollywood bitch there is a scene in which bacall breaks into tears very unsuitable for her character there are two or three bad musical numbers but my fast forward button was ready br br if you're interested in reading my biographies of bogart bacall huston and other hollywood personalities contact me by e mail,0
though i really didn't feel anything for lance's character and felt his wife could have done much better with anyone else it could have been a much stronger movie if they had spent more time on character development perhaps with lance i would have liked it better br br however i have to completely agree with doyleluver when they said and to quote glenn quinn's character ben 'i'm the star here in it that's right i'm the talented one ' if you watch the movie just watch him even when he's in the background just his facial expressions all in the eyes you know for sure what motivates ben exactly how he feels about comments even if it's a quick look behind a character's back great acting in a fair film,1
this was one of those wonderful rare moments in t v that i wished i'd captured forever on vhs won't it ever air again br br it was so creative and i remember it was aired once a week and the wait for the next episode was excruciating i want to see it all again i want to buy it i want what i can't have not even on ebay br br so having ranted enough it was by far one of the best series the 80's put out it should be considered a classic but is lost in space at least this website and wikipedia mention it sob br br it was utterly appealing funny flirtatious and original maybe not like sherlock holmes original i actually think quintin is far more attractive and has a better chance with his leading lady than the stiff and chalky holmes ever could,1
no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series of which only 3 have been on so far is awful the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series i found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous as a bbc licence payer after the show i rang bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment i'm amazed that actors of the calibre of trevor eve and sue johnstone didn't object to the story lines these actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons surly they can see it's lost all direction it's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father christmas br br paul bentley west yorkshire england,0
this could have been a rather entertaining film but instead it ranks with other duds like leeches and rest in pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain had they played this flick tongue in cheek it could have been a very entertaining film like re animator or dead alive but juan piquor simon plays it tongue in cheek in spots but straight more often br br the premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs there is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the slugs into aggressive meat eating monsters albeit monsters that move slowly and can be squished under your boot health inspector michael garfiled and two accomplices are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy the climax is a laugh riot unintentional at that which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid actors and screenwriter the scenario of destroying the slugs is br br story no new ground charted here simon seems to play the gore elements tongue in cheek but the dialogue is straight had simon worked with a clever script one with plenty of one liners and eccentric characters this could have been a cult film br br violence you won't be letdown here we get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine italian restaurant the blood and guts that many horror film watchers enjoy is in full swing here you also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug smashing scenes br br acting wow michael garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this film making endeavor is kim terry as his wife does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold your face while you scream bit the teenagers were all horrible actors no exceptions man this film could have used bruce dern or jeffrey combs br br nudity two teens get naughty in bed before they get dispatched in a poorly done scene by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl's bedroom both male and female nudity here,0
notice i have given this 1 star if the option been given i would have given this zero as i put this dvd into my tv and sat down on my couch i was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest i looked this movie up on imdb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so i guess i came into it critical of every mistake but it didn't prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screen br br the box makes this movie out to look well ok at best do not let that fool you this movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world br br the best way i can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it the acting if you can call it that the plot so many holes must look like swiss cheese and the special effects really are just terrible br br please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch br br in the end i'm not saying i can make a better movie than this but i am thinking it,0
you ever get that itch to just kill an hour or two doing chores and watching a movie so bad it defies reason well out renting movies one weekend i see the box art for this one and see the t rex knowing full well that the dinosaur on the package was the t rex from jurassic park i knew i had to rent this just cause i was in the mood for a bad movie br br i was not disappointed in the least br br mad scientists secret formulas a company more concerned about its fortune and shareholders than lives and of course a big poorly animated sock puppet t rex is it me our through out the movie was there scenes clearly spliced from other movies not to mention the rex's hungry is never satisfied ever how he has hungry is beyond me because he actually doesn't have an throat really if you look down his mouth when he roars it's solid like a toy or something now i like watching incredibly bad b movies from time to time because it reminds me how much better a blockbuster movie is this one was hilarious i'm not even sure if this was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy because there are scenes where make no mistake you will laugh br br do i blame the movie's budget yes but the acting didn't help either ok tony todd was actually pretty good as for some of the female roles when you cry shouldn't tears come out meh i am not going to be angry at this movie i knew what i was getting into and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends here's what i recommend watch this movie then immediately watch jurassic park and then lost world back to back you will be writing mr spielberg thank you letters the next day,0
the director outfitted in chains and leather warned the audience at the sf frameline film festival friday night that we were about to see an experiental film experimental leave the video camera on the back seat of the car let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within eyesight a meandering pastiche road show manqué that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place the gratuitous violence that opens the movie drove more than one patron from the castro theater i would have left too but my cine buddy needed a ride home and has this thing about seeing even the worse merde through to the end by the time the lights came up the audience had thinned considerably tepid applause pro forma questions of the director who seemed pleased with the product avoid this film,0
quite average even by monogram standards this mystery a remake of the sphinx has an oddball plot which is not unraveled to much effect you'll see through it after about ten minutes the two leads have some nice breezy dialog at the outset but john hamilton is hopelessly dull as the villain perfectly cast lionel atwill originated the role and warren hymer's nitwit shtick is pretty annoying however it's worth sitting through for a five minute appearance by the incomparable mantan moreland as nicodemus the janitor who gets the better of the defense attorney during a hilarious courtroom appearance you've got to hand it to bill one take beaudine he wasn't much of a director but he would always punch up a routine programmer with some goofy vaudeville,0
anyone who doesn't laugh all through this movie has been embalmed i have watched it at least twenty times and i still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes sally field is absolutely perfect as celest talbert a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise fields at 45 still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that belies her having had three children i'm biased i'm in love with her br br the cast of soapdish is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection kevin kline is flawless as are robert downey jr an ingénue elizabeth shue whoopi goldberg teri hatcher in one of her early roles carrie fisher as the oversexed casting director who auditions an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt on kathy najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer and best of all cathy moriarty as nurse nan who leads the plot to get fields character removed from the show is hilarious br br this movie should have won oscars for best comedy best leading lady in a comedy best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests including writing directing and supporting actors and actresses get the dvd so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years you will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out,1
i know the people and i did some of the animation and graphic design and the show is horrible they are rich little kids who don't have any talent and probably just begged nick to accept them alex has played the drums for one yearm i've played for 4 1 2 the movie is terrible and so is the show this is the craziest most mixed up comedy that even isint funny i've ever seen it is so stupid it makes me want to barf it is just so crazy that nickelodeon would ever accept something like this and so dumb they are sooo stupid and weird i hate them and their show and think once nick realizes how stupid it is they will most hopefully take it off,0
the famous international conductor daniel daréus michael nyqvist has a heart attack with his stressed busy professional life and interrupts his successful career with an early retirement he decides to return to his hometown in the north of sweden from where his mother left when he was a seven year old sensitive boy bullied by conny and other school mates to live a low paced life he buys an old school and is invited to participate in the church choir by the local shepherd stig niklas falk but the reluctant and shy daniel refuses in the principle however he gets involved with the community and feels attracted by lena frida hallgren a local woman with a past with the local doctor his music opens the hearts of the members of the choir affecting their daily life the slow tore andré sjöberg has the chance to participate in the choir inger ingela olsson the wife of stig releases her repressed sexuality gabriella helen sjöholm takes an attitude against her abusive and violent husband the gossiper and frustrated siv ilva lööf opens her heart against lena the fat holmfrid mikael rahm cries enough against the jokes of the businessman arne lennart jähkel even daniel starts loving people and lena as the love of his life when they are invited to participate in an important contest in vienna daniel finds his music opening the heart of people making his dream come true br br så som i himmelen is a touching and sensitive movie with a very beautiful story it is impressive how director kay pollak and the screenplay writers have been able to develop a great number of characters in 132 minutes running time the performances are top notch supported by magnificent music score and at least two awesome moments when gabrielle sings her song in the concert and certainly the last concert in vienna with the audience jury and everybody participating in the melody and daniel making his dream come true like in teorema the stranger changes the lives not of only a family but of a conservative community further like many european movies the open conclusion indicates that daniel actually died at least in my interpretation reaching peace with the success of his music my eyes became wet in these two scenes my vote is nine br br title brazil a vida no paraíso the life in the paradise,1
maybe it's because i saw the movie before reading the book but i really love this movie i've seen it many many times and will be watching it many times more it's a compelling story that's interesting from the beginning to the end it has everything action romance etc,1
there's something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above every tarzan movie that followed it including the bloated and boring 1980s piece greystoke once the viewer gets past the first three scenes which are admittedly dull tarzan and his mate takes off like a shot offering non stop action humor and romance maureen o'sullivan is charming and beautiful as jane and walks off with the movie weismuller is solid as well highly recommended,1
i don't really know where to start the acting in this movie was really terrible i can't remember seeing so many 'actors' in one film that weren't able to act not only the acting was bad the characters were incredibly stupid as well br br then there's the action i believe that even children know that when someone gets shot there's blood involved but when someone gets shot in snitch'd for ten times there's no blood at all well i guess that's just me br br to make a long story short because believe me i can go on for hours about this film this is without a doubt the worst film i ever saw this film should be number 1 in the bottom 100 without a doubt,0
when i saw commercials for this i was thinking no what has nick at nite done because it was taking up fresh prince slots well i still love the fresh prince but george lopez is a surprisingly good show i love how not stereotypical benny is carmen is a pretty good character its really funny to see how stupid and overemotional she can be sometimes i feel bad for the guy who plays max he looks much younger then he actually is but max is a fun character and acted well and yeah angie is a little stereotypical but she has her funny moments ha ha george does have a big head nah but he can be really good too funny show it definitely should be on more often then home improvement,1
i don't watch soaps my grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass i made fun of them it when i was ten it was so easy br br but this movie takes parody and spells it a new way i found the story pretty damn funny the fashions of the 80's shoulder pads sequins and polyester just top it off the huge hair the high heels and the histrionics what a combination br br and all the actors just go to town chewing up their parts and spitting them out in a big well scripted pile sally kevin elisabeth wonderful whoopi great robert downey refreshing to see him back when he had such potential before the tabloids and garry why did we have to wait so long to see him on film leesa gibbons hadn't been missing her but nice to include her as a real life entertainment reporter and where do you apply for that job anyway br br admittedly i could have done without sally climbing the drainpipe lucy ricardo did it how many times as has every comedienne from carol burnett to i don't know who and i'm so done with it now i could spit peanuts if i had them apparently it's what you do when you're being funny in a tall building in new york i'm just thankful they didn't pull out the flagpole bit br br but it was cute it was funny it had plot twists it had an after credits ending before that was common it had clothes worthy of a second glance it had a great cast and it's got personal memories for me really what more do you need,1
first off let's start with the negative points 1 there are huge gaping wholes in the story line and questions that are raised that will get no where near being answered 2 the movie is not for all people so impolite viewers will get restless and start yapping during the movie br br point two above is important because the movie is very quiet in an older type theater like the one i went to you can hear the reel going through the projector at times i loved that the movie does not keep you busy with music nor effects it lets you reflect upon what is happening br br there is a lack of rhythm that generates an atmosphere that is fascinating an utterly enjoyable the same kind of atmosphere generated by stanley kubrick in eyes wide shut not for all people br br i would highly recommend it to fans of cinema as the cinematographic work is amazing those that base their appreciation of a movie solely on the story will be utterly disappointed it's the kind of story that you have to make up the links in your mind afterwards my version of it is pretty darn cool but probably quite off track if you do go catch the movie there is one very cool part when the two cops are talking to each other on their cell phones an ultra cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment hats off to the person that thought of doing this,1
nifty little episode played mainly for laughs but with clever dollop of suspense somehow a martian has snuck aboard a broken down bus on its way to nowhere but which passenger is it talk about your illegal immigrants all star supporting cast from wild eyed jack elam hamming it up shamelessly to sexy jean willes if she's the martian then i say let's open the borders to cruel faced john hoyt the most obvious suspect along with familiar faces john archer and barney phillips and a nice turn from bill kendis as the bus driver makes for a very entertaining half hour even if the action is confined to a single set,1
forgive me for stating the obvious but some films are good and some films are bad of course there are extremes within those two broad categories films such as the godfather saving private ryan and star wars slot comfortably into the good category at the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply don't deserve to be mentioned by name occasionally however someone produces a truly woeful film a film that should be singled out as a demonstration of how awful a film can be a film that is more than bad such a film is maiden voyage br br briefly maiden voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil scheming ship's owner of course there is an all american hero on board complete with chiselled jaw and sculptured chest who saves the day br br this is a production that plumbs new depths everything about it is bad the acting the direction and the so called plot are breath takingly poor in short it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer even an american viewer would be annoyed by its shortcomings br br yes it's that bad br br i will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that angered me about this film however its dumber than dumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what i mean br br imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea you are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb said hero throws the bomb to you and dives overboard what would you do i don't know about you but i would throw the bomb as far as i possibly could into the sea not this guy he watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate for him results enough said such a demise would merit a mention in the darwin awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production team's lives,0
the world is a terrible place but this movie is farce and it's fun and if you don't like it you don't get it and if you don't get it doesn't matter it's up to you if you want to play along every actor in this one had fun it's only a joke and that's good enough for me gabriel byrne is priceless byrne and paul anka doing my way is as vic puts it the best version ever okay it's no masterpiece but it's not bad i was warned against seeing it but i'm sure glad i did,1
this movie was made for tv so taking that into account i'm not going to rip into it as hard as i would a feature film the script is sub par but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots whether it means to be or not the acting is mostly over the top but that is true for many lower budget movies br br the aspect of this movie that i really hated though was that 90 95 of it is shot on film but in random places there will be 5 10 seconds where the footage is shot on video you can tell because there is less contrast the colors are less vivid and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second i'm not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn't have the money to shoot on film i assume this is why anyway but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look br br anyway i've definitely seen worse movies but i definitely wouldn't say that i enjoyed this movie and i can't recommend that anyone see it,0
i was thinking that the main character the astronaut with the bad case of the runs in his case his skin hair muscles etc could always get more movie work after he'd been reduced to a puddle all he has to do is get a job as the blob the premise of this flick is pretty lame an astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiation i think and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day not only is this a puzzler but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity huh have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens the person instantly turns into a killing machine why is that br br the astronaut lumbers off into the night from the 'secret facility' which has no security whatsoever shedding parts of himself as he goes apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad maybe because he wanted to return to space br br thus begins the part of the movie that's pretty much filler with a doctor wandering around with a geiger counter trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off he kills a stupid bill gates look alike fisherman scares a little girl a la the frankenstein monster movie and finishes off a wacky older couple punishing them karmically for stealing some lemons then there's a short scene where he whacks his former general and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around you'd think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away the scene would shift but no we're treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror even though the monster is gone all i could think was director's girlfriend anyone br br the end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it the melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo and then nothing that's it that's the end of the movie well at least that meant that there was no room for a sequel,0
pandora's clock is among the best thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you will ever see a highly faithful adaptation of john j nance's novel which had a frightfully real scenario in the novel is made even more so here br br despite being made for tv this is first rate entertainment the cast is great and slips into characters from the novel so well that you would think they were reading the novel richard dean anderson steps way outside the shadow of macgyver and gives the best performance of his career to date jane leeves is great her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she can be a fine dramatic actor daphne zuniga is great as dr sanders and despite the character being a man in the book it works incredibly well robert loggia edward herrmann robert guillaume and the rest of the supporting cast are top notch and fit their novel counterparts tot he letter br br there are changes to the story of course including and a slight change in the ending but those changes are for the better when compared with the novel the plot is realistic and very see to believe in the way its presented making this the best airplane set movie since the original airport movie the production values are high and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade or so ago they work fine sets are great especially cia hq and the oval office showing that the filmmakers spent a lot of time to make this work br br it doesn't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa just do both and you won't regret losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel this will leave you breathless,1
full house is a great family show however after watching some episodes over and over again i've realized that they're incredibly boring and they seem to shelter themselves from the outside world a lot yes there is a lot of comedy but there are times when it's incredibly cheesy it's not like i hate it but just don't watch them over and over again because they get old quick probably the best season is the first br br full house is about widower danny tanner bob saget and his three daughters d j candace cameron stephanie jodie sweetin and michelle mary kate and ashley when danny's wife dies the he is in need of some help so his best friend joey dave coulier and the girls' uncle jesse john stamos moves in with them once they live there together they find they can't live without each other br br full house reminds you just how important family is and that you can always go home again,1
after seeing the movie last night i was left with a sense of the hopelessness faced by organisations trying to tackle the problem the film portrays the scale of the prostitution seems so large that it's hard to see how it can be defeated without major governmental changes in cambodia br br anyway on with the review br br although it is a sombre movie with an uncomfortable central relationship this is a very compelling film and i'd even go so far as to say it was enjoyable the film was well edited for the running time and the performance by thuy nguyen was excellent i also felt ron livingston played a very difficult role well br br it would have been nice to have a little more insight into why patrick feels he has to help holly but maybe the reason is a simple as he explains to chris penn's character i won't explain it here go see the movie br br this is a good thought provoking film with obviously good intentions i hope it gets a wide enough release to reach a decent sized audience and gain more support for the k 11 project,1
after hearing raves about this movie for years i finally decided to rent it and watch let me start by saying that i'm glad that the rental was free from the local library this move was slow boring unrealistic and the plot made no sense after 2 hours i was ready to nuke that backwater texas town and put the group of those characters out of their misery i realize that taste is subjective but believe me i just do not understand all of the hype that i have heard about this movie dallas provided as good a detail of the life in texas as this movie rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the general public that a bad movie is good,0
reading all of the comments are very exciting but can someone please tell me the name of the real artist that painted the pictures for the good times broadcast i realize that everyone refers to j j as the artist in the family but there was a real family that has the real artist and he hasn't gotten any credit in this sight yet so if you don't mind if someone can tell the name of the real artist i would also like to tell him job well done i know this sight is for the good times cast but wouldn't you agree that he has also touched the hearts of us all i would like to know if he still paints or if he is still alive i would like to have some of his work displayed in my home,1
okay look i've seen lots and i do mean lots of these types of films you know the ones where the dvd cover just look so good and scaarrryyy that you just cant wait to see it well i got got again and i'm getting' pretty tired of it but i digress it's pretty simple it sucked i know rather juvenile but it did andi so agree with the other poster that if we had to sit through the boring thing why oh why did the lead actress have to be so unnattractive distractingly so if i may add and the scowl she used convey unresolved pain grief over the death of her daughter did little help i mean jesus oh but the crawling on her back demon thingee was pretty neat,0
if i could give this film a real rating it would likely be in the minus numbers while i respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible horror films seriously people buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time br br despite it being a horror film there is nothing scary about it unless the idea of seeing how many horror cliché's you can fit in one movie scares you if the rating had been higher it probably would have made for a better film in the long run br br whoever made this version of prom night you screwed up the actors could probably have done a decent job if it weren't for the questionable scripting this was a terrible waste of a cinema trip i'd sooner go and see one missed call again at least that had some plot,0
'i only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain ' this is an excell film it should have been re rated to pg 13 but anyways prince's first film and greatest the follow up sucked but i haven't seen for years so here's what i can remember about it the kid prince has to juggle with winning over the love of his life apollonia herself keeping his band together the revolution as themselves and the tension in his family but his rival band the time as themselves is ruining his life like morris himself is trying to steal apollonia from the kid just like saturday night fever flashdance and 8 mile really good rent it laugh and cry and if you luv it buy it,1

br br after dark my sweet is a strange mix of sensuality and dullness the film runs slow very slow but takes a rythm to tell a story about murder and passion jason patric never ever was so sexy and powerful the man gives a true performance and rachel ward is all but sexy br br the sexual tension the pshycological heat the footsteps of the past the flashback scenes the weirdness of the patric´s character all becomes a sexy mystery i recommend this one cause is the more sexy dull movie that i ever seen check the love making scene it´s particulary sexy,1
as someone else mentioned it begins with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat then the main story a photographer gaffari and a writer shepard meet by chance and take a trip into the mountains first they spend the night at an inn where the slightly deaf landlord gets hollered at with increasing irritation to the audience by gaffari once in the mountains they seek shelter again and are invited in by a kindly old lady who seems overly hospitable to strangers hansel and gretel anyone what happens next i will leave for the bold viewer to sort out because i most assuredly couldn't now i like eurohorror and this woulda been better if only artigot writer and director had made some attempt at logical story telling the backdrop pyrenees makes an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult occurrences the verdant peaks could easily obscure supernatural forces and those who command them the photography is nice just wish the whole thing made sense you can view this film at archive org,0
antonioni's movies have aged not well what always surprised me about them is that besides an unquestionable plastic beauty there is a dull and didactic psychology of the characters and situations remember for instance the conversations between mastroianni and the wicked capitalistic that wants sing up him in la notte or monica vitti laughing at the peasants flirting in the train in la aventura or ferzetti dropping the glass of ink at the end of the same film br br i have reviewed yesterday zabriskie point in this film there are a lot of nice and elaborate shots of the rod taylor office the streets and highways of l a the publicity advertisements the deserts etc that show the fascination of the author in his american journey in the same way than wim wenders years later unfortunately there are too a lot of hippie leftist clichés that spoil the movie the boy leaves the meeting steals an aeroplane and flies over the desert in order to liberate himself and find something different the executives in grey suites speak all the time about speculation the girl looks at the object women in the swimming pool and leaves because she wants not to be like them the couple of fat middle class in the caravan speak in front of the beauty of the nature of building a hotel and earning a lot of money last but not the least a lot of couples making love in the desert what a hippie platitude br br sorry today half a century after the revolution of la aventura we can see that the king is naked and his films except le amiche and perhaps il grido are only a handful of aestheticism and commonplaces,0
this version moved a little slow for my taste and i suppose i have problems with this play to begin with but first the movie it's a typical tv movie version of a play which means it doesn't have the flair of the original film version with william holden what they couldn't afford to hire more than twelve people as extras why move the movie up to 1966 so you could give the little sister a line about the vietnam war protests why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement br br as for the casting some hits some misses jay o sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with josh brolin brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes he's believable as an ex bmoc jock but he doesn't have the raw sensuality of william holden i always thought brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him pardon the pun gretchen moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played she didn't project the innocence or ignorance that the character required maybe it's because she and brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be but then again holden was ten years too old bonnie bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and mary steenburgen can't seem to make up her mind whether she was playing blanche dubois or katharine from the taming of the shrew br br as for mr inge's play i always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue the twilight zone i believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode spur of the moment where a young diana hyland was being chased by a bitter older diana hyland because the younger diana hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to hal carter,0
this is one of my favorite sports movies dennis quaid is moving and convincing in the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arm gave out on him as a high school coach he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them he'll try out for a baseball team if they do they win partly because of all the batting practice they take with a coach who can pitch over 90 miles an hour and he keeps his side of the bargain and is signed br br if you have ever decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult jim morris's story will resonate with you it is moving and inspiring and the man's relationships ring true br br inspiration is not the only reason i rent this one though dennis quaid is just downright purdy in the part and a baseball movie with a good looking man changing a diaper is my idea of heaven ladies if you feel the way i do check this one out,1
i had seen lady with red hair back when it appeared and didn't remember it as something to cherish the truth is that notwithstanding its base in a true story its screen play is silly and unbelievable the real merit of the picture is the cast a constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30's and 40's make a background for the delicate intelligent work of the always underrated miriam hopkins and the wonderful spectacular performance of claude rains who as usual is the best thing in the picture what an actor he never won an oscar but he is in the good company of chaplin garbo and hitchcock perhaps lady with red hair contains his best work in films see it and enjoy him br br,1
and i actually gave it a zero on my personal 1 10 scale i have been attending movies since 1952 and have seen well over 1000 in the theater i don't rate movies that i see only on tv this is the only movie i have ever rated zero br br my wife and i took our four children then aged 15 11 8 and 6 and even the kids thought it was terrible in fact it was my daughter now 26 who alerted me to this site amazed that the movie was getting an overall rating of 4 br br the animation of the dinosaurs looked amateurish at the time and is even worse in retrospect the acting particularly by sean young is atrocious and the story line is simply silly br br,0
br br this is definitely a 'must see' for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in their secret hide out trying to avoid being caught by parents teachers the police etc the protagonist is a lady in her forties living in her mansion breeding orchids and absolutely unaware of the fact that her so called rich and truthful husband is actually broke and cheating on her when he all of the sudden dies she is confronted with the truth the bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt she doesn't know what to do until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in britain she decides after some long thinking to get rid of her flowers and start breeding pot instead the story is quite original the performances outstanding i can think of only a few movies that made me laugh more than this one still the melodramatic touch is present the film is typical british the jokes aren't vulgar there is no violence involved it shouldn't be mentioned that it is recommended to have taken a few draughts before watching 'saving grace' it will be so much more fun especially the scene with the 2 old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious i thought my jawbones would burst 9 10,1
why should you watch this there are certainly no reasons why you shouldn't watch it superbly and amusingly directed by albert and david maysles grey gardens was originally intended to be a film on the gentrification of east hampton but it turned out to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric life of the two edith bouvier beales the aunt and cousin of jacqueline kennedy onassis their life was certainly an amusing one edith spent most of her day in bed singing operas edie performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats one was named ted z kennedy the film is interesting because it is both funny and sad edith died shortly after the film was released in february 1977 aged 82 after experiencing some of the fame that she and edie received after the film she danced and sang in a nightclub edie beale jr was born in 1925 and is still living in miami beach this film is both engaging and spellbounding,1
this is the touching story of two families in israel and the relationships within each family each family has a gay son the stories are interrelated at that point but this film is about all of the family members not just the two sons the portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn and the story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak,1
one of the best comedy series to ever come out of britain mark gatiss reece shearsmith and steve pemberton are terrific actors and performers who seem at home with drama as they are with comedy ably supported by their writing partner jeremy dyson they have peopled the series with the most memorable characters of recent years little britain pales into insignificance as a poor imitation of their ideas consistently original and groundbreaking i am sure that as many people hate these series as love them but i am equally as sure that no one could have no opinion on log i have yet to see the feature length movie but i have heard good things and bad things so i will reserve judgement the original radio series from which log came was as innovative as the tv series became i don't know whether the tv series made it to the us but i would be fascinated to see how american audiences found the weird englishness of the humour,1
when converting a book to film it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author's intended tone or conveyed concepts rather than ignoring the author altogether while it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of elinore stewart's children it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good enriching strengthening experiences of homesteading her land the book details her life on her and her husband's adjoining homesteads in the vast wyoming frontier she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances though they lived dozens of miles apart the film however takes a standard stance for the time it was made portraying this woman's experience as harsh unforgiving and nearly pointless perhaps the director was bringing some of his vietnam war experiences with him to this movie as some film aficionados have said but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak odious landscape devoid of friends or hope don't waste your time with this movie read the book instead,0
i am extremely picky about the films i see i'd heard about moon child completely by accident i've been a fan of l'arc en ciel for some time and a fan of gackt and mizer only recently br br i finally found out the film was being re released and picked it up without a second thought br br being as critical as i am about films i will admit the action scenes can be somewhat hokey at times but they're meant too be as another user suggested it's the quintessential calm before the storm quoting gary oldman from leon without getting into the spoilers the film hit me extremely hard because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are limitless and as they often say true friendship is loyalty and like marriage it's until death do you part br br hyde and gackt give performances that showcase why they are able to commit such depth to their song lyrics their passion for music happens onto the big screen and in the process it creates an exemplary film that will reach into one's soul and evoke response emotionally br br upon seeing the film for the first time i realized it will probably remain in heavy rotation as far as my collection goes i want to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up the film if you want to get away from the current hollywood trend in film this takes an entirely new direction using classic yakuza film elements and how can you go wrong with a cameo from ryo ishibashi of takashi miike's audition and suicide club fame br br man i just can't say enough about this film but i'll stop here br br 10 10,1
red rock west 1993 br br nicolas cage gets embroiled in a deadly crime without at first knowing it and the dominos lead to increasing peril adventure and misadventure in the wild forlorn american west of the 1990s red rock west is often brutal and sometimes hilarious and cage pulls off the mixture with his usual sardonic wit and wary ease br br is the plot over the top yes is dennis hopper perfect as a crazed almost likable killer yes does cage stand a chance well you have to watch and see it never lets up and it took me by surprise the first time i saw it on second viewing yesterday i was surprised at how well it held up how well constructed it was and how macabre and funny it was at the same time br br director ron dahl who also helped write is known more for his tv work but with rounders and this film he shows a deft hand with sensational plots it's saved by its humor by the way and by the caricatures the bar is sleazy the cops questionable and don't miss a really inspired cameo by dwight yoakam as a truck driver,1
although the recent re telling of part of homer's epic troy with brad pitt was entertaining once iphigenia with the incandescent irene pappas is breathtaking unfolding in a natural setting with greek actors speaking their own language lends such authenticity a chance encounter with this film on one of directv's many movie channels kept me interested in spite of my concentration problems there is no glitter or bling in this movie just a fabulously rich story impeccably told by actors so real one feels they are eavesdropping on a real family in turmoil i think even homer if he really existed would be proud of this telling br br jlh,1
this is a trio of tales shakti devi and kali about an experimental commune or some such thing called the taylor eriksson group which took people on journeys inside themselves and into the realm of the unknown and left a bit of damage here and there i'd say many years later some of that damage is still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show itself shakti tells the tale of a woman whose husband died mysteriously in fact he was torn apart and the suspect was a man that may not have existed seems this woman is able to project some inner demon or so finds out the sister of the man who was killed when she attempts to talk to this woman while posing as a reporter devi tells the tale of a young man who wants to jump out of his skin he's a skinhead a speed freak and is sent to see a psychiatrist who just happens to be a former member of this commune which results in the good doctor helping the young man to realize his desire this is probably the best of the three segments kali tells the tale of a healer who attempts to heal this woman who was a part of this commune and lets loose some kind of demon that has lived in this woman but one wonders if he did it or if she loosed it because it could not survive in her any longer all three of these tales are pretty creepy and suspenseful because you're never really sure what to expect and the premise and the settings are so unlike those of conventional horror films that it adds to the strangeness this has a sort of low budget look and feel to it but it also manages to conjure up a pretty creepy atmosphere throughout much to its credit i watched this with my mouth hanging open a good portion of the time and when the real scares and gore came it hit pretty hard i found this to be a very interesting and disturbing film and liked it a lot a good little find this one i'd give it 8 out of 10,1
this is a very exciting and romantic film i have seen it several times and never get bored with it everything is realistic and it is a good plot the actors are excellent liam neeson jessica lange tim roth and brian cox br br i actually prefer this film to braveheart as braveheart contain so many historical misstakes there is many exciting scenes watch out for the bridge scen and the last fencing scene this is really good and surprising scenes br br the music are lovely it really suits to the movie the setting is amazing,1
unlike some comments mine is positive this movie wraps around the dinner table with a group of friends some you like some you don't a few are related mother daughter son their stories are not one smooth happy with everyone and everything type of life much like real life some story lines do not evolve they just happen but like true families and good friends they stick together the wanna be parents who are buying a baby are such a holes you are happy for the ending poor delmar is stuck between a rock and a boulder taking care of herself her mom her son and trying to keep all their lives together this does not end with a sunset walk or house in the 'burbs and all are living in a dream world but is a very real life portrayal of people living day to day month to month overall this is a good story and a great movie,1
this movie is so good i could watch it all day long mary kate and ashley were robbed at oscar time if i got to be one of the actors i would be so excited i can't wait for the new charlie's angels movie starring mary kate and ashley,1
i don't know what it is about this movie director sam mraovich somehow messed up just about every little aspect in this movie i would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist but this movie may be the most important of all time this movie should exist for the sole purpose of being without a doubt 'the worst movie ever made' i've seen bad movies in my lifetime but this somehow breaks what i considered bad into something much more hard to imagine br br everything in this movie is hilarious but the single funniest thing is that mraovich himself considers this to be a great movie br br oh wow,0
with very little screen time and money dan katzir manages to do so much this movie in its heart warming simplicity touches the beauty of love from a fresh angle rejuvinated lust,1
cut to the chase this is one of the five worst films that i've ever seen br br not that they didn't try there was some decent writing with some elements of structure in there a good cast some good acting i'm not sure where it went wrong but it went horribly wrong br br some of the elements may have been bad structure and no substantive story a lot of overacting by the lead who probably is much better when restrained some bad directing and editing i had enough at about an hour tearing my hair out at about a hour and a half and very agitated at the hour and fifty minutes it ran there was also an insincerity about it all being that i went with someone who used to be a heroin addict he was agitated that it glamorized something that had nothing good to it that was bolstered by the pretty 17 year old girl who was in love with the 30 year old junkie br br and the frantic nature of the lead was a turn off enough there were clunky plot points that were an attempt at a structure but the end result was listless and unending with uneven time lines the characters were colorful but to no end which made me feel bad for the quality actors who you've just not seen enough br br skip it i assumed that this was a first time director who was enamored by his own turds but he has done this before i'm puzzled how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money,0
dark angel is a cross between huxley's brave new world and percy's love in the ruins portraying the not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order both in the worst sense of the word once one swallows the premise that all modern technology can be brought to a standstill by the pulse it provides an entertaining landscape for exploring the personalities of and relationships between the two primary characters max the dark angel bike messenger and logan the rich rebel it seems uneven perhaps a result of a variety of authors but is held together by the energetic beautiful and charming jessica alba who seems both strong and calloused yet vulnerable and sensitive i think that fox has done it again,1
i admit not being that fond of oliver as a young child it's long and the story is a little slow moving because of all the musical numbers as a teenager i discovered that the fun of this movie is the experience itself rather than thinking of it as an adaptation of oliver twist think of it as a celebration of the classic story the adaptation is loose at best but really if you're watching a musical you ain't there for the story br br the music is the core of this movie and an overwhelming majority of it is stellar and very catchy most or all of the cast was involved in the stage version of the musical and it shows in their performances and i consider this a plus the performances are all in a more stagey style of acting typical of much older films and they are very entertaining the exception is the kid playing oliver whose job seemed to be to look cute and stay out of the real performers' way br br fagin and the dodger are the real stars of this movie oliver reed also does a fantastic job maintaining an intimidating screen presence as the menacing bill sykes even sykes' dog bullseye puts on a good performance br br this movie isn't for everyone people who hate musicals will despise it as will those who take musicals too seriously nitpicking over faulty historical details or mistaking exaggerated stage type acting for bad acting will ruin anyone's enjoyment just sit back and enjoy the entertainment it's much better if you remember that as a musical it's a fantasy loosely organized around the book not a strict adaptation,1
rock 'n' roll high school was one of the best movies ever made i think the only reason it was so awesome was because of the ramones you couldn't have made the same movie and put something like the sex pistols or the clash in place of the ramones it just wouldn't have been the same dey young clint howard vincent van patten mary woronov paul bartel and the hall monters just added to the movie the whole entire movie is about the ramones especially joey so everybody showed see rock 'n' roll high school if your a huge fan of real punk not the sissy new crap but the loud and fast kind the kind only the ramones could do r i p rest in peace joey ramone 1951 2001 dee dee ramone 1952 2002,1
this is the film in antonioni's middle period that most critics dismiss quickly as a 'flawed' look at 60s american youth culture politics for what it's worth i found it more touching and memorable than his more acclaimed films like l'avventura perhaps because he shows more emotion empathy here than anywhere else the story is simple but it is used as a frame for antonioni's brilliant observations of and critique on american consumerist culture student life the counter culture and the whole anti establishment anti war backlash that was so prominent then br br even from a purely technical point of view it is a remarkably crafted film from the opening credits sequence to the bizarre desert 'love in' to the use of billboards and right down to that jaw dropping cathartic finale that used 17 camera set ups in it's own way as powerful as the climax of the wild bunch also antonioni chose one hell of a leading lady with daria halperin one of the most beautiful ever to grace the screen there isn't much 'acting' involved as this feels more like a docu drama and so the use of non professionals as the lead couple works quite effectively within that context and the soundtrack is not only filled with marvelous music its use is impressive as well i can't forget the start of the film mostly due to the selection of music by pink floyd that grooms the visuals so well br br contrary to popular opinion this is quite an achievement in cinema and one i would enthusiastically recommend to anyone with a taste or tolerance for the off beat well worth seeking out and one of those key films of the 60s that demands a dvd restoration release,1
a lot of death happens in the wild you don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out but does it need to be the focus of a nature documentary what is with this fascination with gruesome death do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds by a pack of hungry lions or a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion no less i thought this was going to be a family friendly nature film br br and why not have the courage to show the gruesome violence in the film's trailers were the filmmakers afraid of losing money br br then in typical comic relief fashion we get to see the magnificent birds of paradise perform mating rituals to the most annoying and stupid narration humanly possible it was surreal it's as if the filmmakers believed they were only addressing a roomful of first and second graders on a school field trip wow from the mean to the moronic in a heartbeat br br if there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings reading this film review why not focus on animals actually copulating giving birth laying eggs bathing sleeping cleaning each other socializing playing emotional displays other than fear and anger unusual behaviors like mouth brooding migration problem solving skills culture yes many animal species have what humans call culture communication skills parenting healing abilities etc in other words stop focusing on violence or dumbing down beauty and why not be much more well rounded and focus on delight and inspiration instead,0
wow this was probably the worst dcom ever i watched the first half hour and i laughed brenda song plays wendy the popular girl with the hot jock boyfriend and stuck up friends who is determined to be homecoming queen she is supposed to save the world as a warrior and shin comes to her aid to help her with her martial arts shin teaches her the skills of a snake tiger etc and she has to learn certain techniques to save the world br br this movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and the chinese culture but the acting and casting was horrible br br brenda song is a comedic actress and i can't see her playing a serious role it was laugh out loud funny watching her cry over shin shin couldn't act at all and everything was totally unbelievable br br i watched this movie and tried to think of something similar and the thing i came up with was the power rangers this movie is so fake and the stunts were so power ranger esquire that it was just corny and stupid the characters weren't likable and i just couldn't stand to watch it disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies high school musical is the only movie that deserves to be on disney channel along with other movies like jumping ship color of friendship go figure read it and weep stuck in the suburbs br br if you like action adventure and corny jokes you'll like this movie,0
i consider this movie a masterpiece but it took me at least 4 o 5 times to see it so as to realize what a great movie it was first it describes a face of ww2 that we don't usually see in hollywood movies in particular german soldiers army and the nazi government are shown more humanized one of the facts that impressed me most was the mention by the end of the movie of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's that forest is the place where the final chapters of berlin alexanderplatz take place those are the woods where reinhold kills mieze another clue for those who like the details is the representation of doors fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door or a door is opened many doors are shown in the screen opened and closed and the characters change in their personality their acts etc any time that happens have you noticed that,1
this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation women and performers both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture br br the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors' performance br br a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies,1
utterly predictable silly show about a man who has killed his wife by mowing her down when driving and claimed he had blacked out why was he still driving a car why did he still feel able to drive a car having killed his wife with one this question has not occurred to the writers the story then witters on about a psychologist and her failing marriage which is tied into the failing marriage of wife killing blackout driver an omniscient mother and one dimensional child are thrown in for good measure and the whole builds up to a predictable denouement and crashing finale are police psychologists so easily taken in deadful writing that the actors do their best with but they are doomed to failure this is on a par with a harlequin romance don't waste your time watching this one unless that's what you are aiming for,0
i don't know how anyone could hate this movie it is so funny it took a unique mind to come up with this storyline it's not your typical alien movie these aliens are so stupid and confused you need to rent it at least once,1
a nice shirely temple short child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time perhaps being seen and not heard needed to be made up for aside from that this is fun given the films era there are certain aspects of the thing from a social viewpoint that strike me as both very progressive and liberal i won't go into those here i'd rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements as early on as it was its easy to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for temple that makes it worth watching if you're a temple fan for others its a cool way to kill ten minutes while you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove,1
i'm a jean harlow fan because she had star quality i don't think her movies are good and i don't even think that she was a good actress but she certainly was great in comedies every bit of comedy in the girl from missouri is very good but this movie is perhaps more like a love story jean harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast their performances bring nothing new it always impresses me much to think that harlow's beautiful body was that of an ill woman well in this movie she does look beautiful,0
i recall seeing this movie as a kid i don't recall where i saw it i must have been around 14 years old i thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again it came on the kung fu channel once but i missed it i was really bummed it is the best special effects kung fu movie that i've seen to date i highly recommend it and now that i've discovered where to get it i can enjoy it once more and for years to come i also have to check out this return of the venom movie of which some have spoken so highly,1
i recently caught up with this little gem of a film on cable it took me by surprise even though i should have expected it from the team involved with this movie br br henry bromwell directed this film with a sure hand and it shows one always wonders about the secret life of hit killers one doesn't have to go too far to realize they probably are one's own neighbors or social acquaintances or even friends they're no different from us at least on the surface br br in this story the grandfather is a despicable character who does not hesitate in eliminating anyone for the right price he has no scruples in teaching the ropes to his own son and even to the grandson br br alex is a man living in turmoil he knows what he has done in the past and suddenly is coming to realize the consequence of his actions he has to see someone to help him find peace with himself in going to dr parks he is trying to find absolution although he doesn't find it there on the contrary there is a dramatic twist when alex learns about who is supposed to kill next br br alex brilliantly portrayed by william h macy mesmerizes us not only is he a fantastic actor but he makes us believe he is that man one of the best things in the movie is the late john ritter he is equally convincing as dr parks the man who unravels the mystery br br donald sutherland as the grandfather is perfect he is a natural actor in everything he does neve campbell surprised in her pivotal role of sarah she shows a capability and range that are incredible tracey ullman is martha the suffering wife and she doesn't get to do much also barbara bain in a rare appearance is the grandmother from hell david dorfman is a delight in the film he shows a maturity beyond his years br br,1
i suck at gratuitous boob references so i'm just going to write a plainly flat no pun intended review i love elvira not in a i'm going to shoot the pres just to impress jodi foster fanatical way but suffice to say i think she rocks the movie is played like a 50's horror film only alot more fun look for the leasurely stroking of the ankle reference to know what i mean what relay shines through in the movie is elvira's or should that be cassandras absolute charm i first saw this movie at the tender age of 8 and have seen it contless times since i realy should get around to buying a copy the videostore version is looking a little worse for the wear if any other fans of the movie want to e mail me about it feel free br br p s another great performance from edie mcclurg chastedy pariah an actress who never gets the attention she deserves,1
great woody allen no good woody allen definitely i found myself along with the audience in attendance laughing hard and often at some of the best woody allen lines we've heard in a while the aging allen created an appropriate role for himself as scarlett johansson's father well sort of some have said johansson plays a young dianne keaton i beg to differ she plays woody's dialogue which in his comedies always has a very similar feel like well a woody allen comedy that's fine for us woody appreciators she certainly did woody's dialogue far better than the young cast of his last comedy melinda melinda some may find woody's humor tiresome but for those of us who love it when it's done right we look forward to the next,1
the lady from shanghai is well known as one of hollywood's most troubled productions welles' original cut was taken away by the producers and cut to ribbons this made the already muddled mystery story even more difficult to keep track of they post dubbed a good amount of his dialog because of the density of the irish accent and the dubbing is all too apparent and poorly done most disastrous of all welles and his on screen and real life leading lady rita hayworth were falling apart in their relationship and their tumultuous chemistry comes through on screen br br fortunately this is all overcome by just how fantastic orson welles' direction is he makes the film incredibly stylish and atmospheric every scene just seems to be breathing down your back from the screen also the characters and scenes are so bizarre they border on dreamlike and surreal this sense of weirdness elevates scenes that are often found in these films such as the courtroom sequences in the middle i typically find courtroom dramas a bore but welles' direction and quirky touches make them just as fascinating as everything else the ending at the carnival reminds one of david lynch almost br br the acting here is also very good despite their failing relationship welles and hayworth both give decent performances their interactions however are just a bit lacking everyone else is superb and delightful to watch though especially everett sloane and glenn anders the lady from shanghai obviously has its problems but its worth watching just to see one of cinema's masters at his finest 8 10,1
yeah i'm sure it really could be a nation if four of them all stood at the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times man i am really glad that i saw this movie on fear net instead of renting it i'm a big fan of the george romero movies and i'm pretty sure that if he saw this movie he'd probably throw up while laughing too hard i mean what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like charlie's devils it really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shop police station apartment flat whatever room it was with the gong in the background and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop i couldn't even tell what nationality the killer was and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations didn't help either oh well what can i expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world so for all of those who worship mystery science theater 3000 or if you just like reaming on bad c movies c for craptastic then this is the movie for you or not,0
first time i saw this movie was in the eighties but reviewed now this thriller is still actual some newer movies focus on similar topics but they do not match this french milestone br br a president obviously jf kennedy gets shot in an open car during a public appearance the resulting huge investigation finds the lee harvey oswald figure of this movie guilty but one member of the jury insists in further inquiry he reveals some surprising evidence br br unlike oliver stone's jfk a movie with the same plot this one does not play with emotions but concentrates in a exciting description of a conspiracy and how everything fits together drawing a new picture of the assassination even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene compared to jfk this movie is more reasonable intelligent and thrilling parts of the plot can be found in a lot of newer movies i had a kind of deja vu sometimes sitting in the cinema br br i comme icare is a must see its unique and brilliant and the music by ennio morricone is wonderful this movie deserves a very good ranking if it was a hollywood production it would be famous for sure br br,1
faith domergue better known as dr ruth in this island earth is the only reason to watch this film the story is very thin and once the air force buddies return to the states with a cobra curse upon them the action is just a waiting game see faith the snake woman and try to pretend the rest isn't happening,0
this movie tries hard but completely lacks the fun of the 1960s tv series that i am sure people do remember with fondness although i am 17 i watched some of the series on youtube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun sadly this movie does little justice to the series br br the special effects are rather substandard and this wasn't helped by the flat camera work the script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour other films with under par scripting are home alone 4 cat in the hat thomas and the magic railroad and addams family reunion br br now i will say i liked the idea of the story but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early and i am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy and i was annoyed by the talking suit despite spirited voice work from wayne knight br br but the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of christopher lloyd jeff daniels and daryl hannah all very talented actors jeff daniels has pulled off some good performances before but he didn't seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing and elizabeth hurley's character sadly came across as useless daryl hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored and i liked the idea of her being the love interest but sadly you see very little of her not to mention the monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them likewise with wallace shawn as some kind of government operative christopher lloyd acquits himself better and as an actor i like lloyd a lot he was in two of my favourite films clue and who framed roger rabbit and i am fond of back to the future but he was given little to work with and had a tendency to overact quite wildly br br overall as much i wanted to like this movie i was left unimpressed instead of being fun it came across as pointless and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential with some talented actors and a good idea but wasted with poor execution 1 10 bethany cox,0
uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic edward woodward as the ghost of christmas present wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of bernard cribbins as scrooge george c scott is too wry and he never seems to truly believe in it which robs his performance of its effect the scenes in which he's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half heartedly flicking through his family album no one else seems to be putting any effort in except frank finlay who chronically overacts,0
a bit slow somehow like a sofia coppola movie but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls the magic of the movie lies in its capacity to bring back many memories to how it felt like to be their age the confusion and the insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life the music is perfect and the acting is amazing the camera works beautifully also i highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires i would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period so many movies have been made about adolescence but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexities,1
there's not a drop of sunshine in the sunshine boys which makes the title of this alleged comedy neil simon's sole ironic moment simon who adapted the script from his play which goes uncredited equates old age with irrational behavior and worse clumsy galumphing mean spirited irrational behavior walter matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner george burns for a television special it's said they were a team for 43 years which begs the question how long did vaudeville last anyway burns who won a supporting oscar has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in after which time matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back the noisier the movie gets the less tolerable and watchable it is director herbert ross only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of neil simon's screenplays here ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off such as semi incoherent matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a tv commercial at this point matthau was still too young for this role and he over compensates by slouching and hollering it was up to ross and simon to tone down the character to nuance his temperament to give the sunshine boys some sunniness yet walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf the picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace one loses hope for it early on 1 2 from,0
when you look back at another bad nightmare sequel like freddy's revenge you have to at least give it some credit for trying something new and although the dream child is more enjoyable it offers absolutely nothing new to the series yes there's the creative deaths as usual like a kid becoming part of a comic book and facing super freddy but even scenes like that aren't used to their full potential and the parts without freddy are just boring br br this marked the official death of scariness to the series freddy seems to be the comedic relief now but to what br br my rating 4 10,0
the comparison is perhaps unfair but inevitable those attracted to the intimacy and depth of umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cut and paste musical in the american style awkward stilted dialogue with inexplicable song and dance numbers gene kelly's french accent was apparently so poor that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted as you'll remember the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in umbrellas the translation of the french for subtitled versions as well leaves something to be desired although this can't be attributed to demy the film also has several self aware moments that come off a wee disconcerting such as references in songs to legrand himself and the costumes well the tight pants white boots combination and the freakishly unnatural colors reminds one of an austin powers film br br but demy does reward the viewer with allusions to umbrellas note for instance the suitcase carried by maxence in his departure from rochefort this is the same suitcase carried by guy in his departure from cherbourg also note the convenient brunette of resolution madeleine in umbrellas and josette in young girls br br generally speaking those expecting the natural feel of umbrellas save the floating bicycle scene or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in umbrella's script should probably pass this one b y those looking for a french version of a thin '60s american musical will be quite happy,0
this movie has successfully proved what we all already know that professional basket ball players suck at everything besides playing basket ball especially rapping and acting i can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is first of all is it just me or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen i mean his teeth could be used as a can opener secondly why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when even though he has magical powers he sucks horribly at making music third i have read the bible in no way shape or form did it say that jesus made genies fourth what was the deal with all the crappy special effects i assure you that any acne addled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that fifth why did the ending suck so badly and what the hell is a djin and finally whoever created the nightmare known as kazaam needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the eiffel tower because this movie take the word suck to an entirely new level,0
sadly more downs than ups the plot was pretty decent i mean nothing out of the ordinary but it had a story unlike the other modern horror flicks the other good thing was the cast i'm not saying that the acting was good because it wasn't but every actor actress was hot and attractive br br one of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so the rest was quite boring another down or you could consider it an up if you want is the excessive nudity all 4 girls were topless for a few minutes and all the guys showed their butts for a long time it's not that i'm against nudity but this was a horror movie not 'the dreamers' br br unless you're very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes or watch a girl get naked for no reason or you're a die hard fan of debbie rochon than this is the movie for you but if you're looking for a good horror movie stay away,0

this was by far the worst low budget horror movie i have ever seen i am an open minded guy and i always love a good horror movie in fact when i'm renting movies i specifically look for some good underrated horror movies they are always good for a laugh believe i know i have seen many but this movie was just so terrible it wasn't worth a chuckle i was considering turning it off in the first five minutes which i probably should have there is nothing good about it first and foremost the camera crew suck3d a the intro was stupid just like the ending acting and special effects were terrible please i'm begging you do not watch this movie you will absolutely hate it,0
the makers of this film have created a future where not only is abortion and birth control illegal in every state but women are prosecuted for murder and sent away to serve long prison sentences in other words this film is every liberals worst nightmare the political agenda is so heavy handed here and the style of the film is so low key that it just loses steam pretty quickly regardless of which side of the fence you're on i'd recommend skipping it,0
there aren't many good things to say at all about underneath soderbergh's untrue endeavor into neo noir soderbergh remakes robert siodmak's decent noir criss cross faithfully not altering the plot very much at all however the adaptation drains it of every ounce of its state of the art film noir atmosphere giving it the same story set in the very least appealing places lifestyles and anachronisms soderbergh who would later make wonderful crime films like out of sight and the ocean's series with great style and atmosphere takes the dangerously obvious route to modernization by renovating the story with the ugliest dullest and flattest fashions of the early 1990s nightclubs have terrible revoltingly dressed garage bands peter gallagher's uninteresting version of burt lancaster's anti hero is left by his femme fatale girlfriend for compulsively buying cinematically lifeless modern appliances like stereos tvs and other up to date pieces of equipment that suck the reaction out of the film br br it could've been more entertaining and less boring had it a few saving graces like a good score more flesh to its characters more than just william fichtner giving performances that aren't wooden a crisper pace unfortunately underneath has none of these things soderbergh a fine director does not utilize his dry detachment to the benefit of his film this time that disposition works wonderfully when he's helming a crime movie with more tongue in its cheek like the george clooney pictures previously mentioned or a social or character drama like traffic or sex lies and videotape with a movie like underneath it intensifies the boredom experienced by the viewer,0
in director eric stanze's 'isoyc ipoyg' three men are subjected to torture at the the hands of a woman that they have all sexually abused the first victim is forced to eat his own crap before being axed to death the next bloke ends up with a bullet in the crotch after refusing to have anal sex with the first guy's corpse but it's the third man who gets it the worst he has to watch the heavily tattooed 'star' emily haack get naked and masturbate with a broom handle oh he also gets the handle shoved up his butt too br br and unfortunately so do we get to see her masturbate that isnot get a broom handle up our butts br br yes 'isoyc ipoyg' is one harsh viewing experience not because of its relentless violence but because haack who is obviously under the misguided notion that she has the body of a goddess as opposed to that of a roadie for metallica constantly gets buck naked for the camera it ain't a pretty sight br br in addition to the non stop nudity from an inked up haack viewers also get to see dreadful direction from stanze who thinks that endless shots of tombstones and trees is entertaining stuff some really bad acting and a fat guy's penis br br strangely enough i give 'isoyc ipoyg' a rating of 3 10 which is actually slightly higher than its current 2 9 average that's one point for the messy axe attack which being a gore hound i actually enjoyed one point for the bit where the fat guy gets his face pushed in chocolate mousse masquerading as feces hilarious and one point for the sheer nerve to suggest that this film might somehow be a sequel to meir zarchi's superior exploitation classic i spit on your grave,0
this great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a dvd along with prelude to war the great american filmmaker and story teller frank capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused world war ii and hitler's rise br br every school child nay every american should watch these films today because they are so apropos history has been repeating itself over and over again the lord chamberlains are still alive and kicking the tactics used by the nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the communists and now by muslim terrorist groups are still working to these evil group's advantage br br by sitting back and letting hitler as early as 1935 be aggressive france america and england caused over 50 million people's deaths americans french and british today would happily let hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties br br these great films may be too simplistic for world war ii history buffs they don't tell the horrors that the soviet union caused simply because at the time america was teamed up with them fighting hitler this film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war,1
bruce lee was a great martial artist but this film still is probably one of the worst films ever made it has bruce lee die as the result of falling off a helicopter after being hit by some kind of a ninja knife to the back of the neck but it doesn't explain how he came to be on a helicopter since the prior scene has him near but not on the helicopter which is already 200 feet in the air it just gets downright absurd from then like something out of a cheap comic book maybe the idea isn't so rotten but it isn't done with any degree of artistry from a film making point of view there are dozens of such martial arts bombers out there usually all made in hong kong i think that jean claude van dam improved the genre with adding plausible stories in his films and having film makers who know how to use the camera even steven seagal's films are way better than 90 percent of the martial arts junk movies made during the 1970s and early 1980s in hong kong 'game of death ii' falls into the category of junk cinema in my opinion despite bruce lee being in it,0
i really enjoyed this movie it succeeded in doing something that few movies do now it provided family values while entertaining me nancy drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls to look up to the little girls i was with throughly enjoyed the movie and kept talking about nancy as we walked out of the theater the movie has relatively few problems for families and i don't think parents will get bored sitting in the theater no it won't win an oscar and it did not showcase magnificent special effects or even provide a horribly spooky mystery but it entertained me and it stood true to the the spirit of the books i would definitely recommend this movie to anybody with a young girl she will love it or any fan of the books you will not be disappointed,1
this movie was on the romance channel and i thought it might be a goofy 80's movie that would be enjoyable on some level so my brother and i watched it boy did it suck boy gets crush on girl correction his dream girl apparently there is a difference and i'm surprised he realized she was his dream girl he was smitten with her from over 30 feet away i guess that just goes to show the power of dream girls boy ends up masquerading as a female to be near dream girl creative in the sense that it's a far out plan but un creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions one might think up awkward situations ensue a match is made all of which takes seems to take place around late afternoon either the location was somehow responsible for this odd lighting or the actors had to wait until they got off of their day jobs to come to the set i suspect the latter very clumsily done very pathetic it's almost never even amusing accidentally so there really is nothing to redeem it unless you're interested in seeing chad lowe's early days before he finally got his piece of the pie with his role as the hiv positive gay guy on the series life goes on or gail o'grady who was on nypd blue and probably got to stare at dennis franz's buttocks but those are unlikely motives i'd say systematic derangement of the senses would be a more justified purpose i'm surprised i watched it all i guess it's the kind of thing where halfway through you find yourself still watching due to some morbid self flagellistic inner issue and think you might as well finish it so you can tell your friends and family that you actually sat through such a horrible movie on the off chance that it'll garner you some sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health can you take the challenge,0
this movie is not very good in fact it is the worst elvis movie i have seen it has very little plot mostly partying beer drinking and fighting burgess meredith and thomas gomez are wasted i don't know why they did this movie you could say elvis was wasted as well he is much much better in follow that dream,0

after being bitten by a bat in a cave a doctor named john beck undergoes an accelerating transformation into a man bat creature his wife assures him that there's nothing wrong with him it's all just due to rabies or the anti rabies drugs he's taking the local cop thinks that john is responsible for several gruesome murders the bat people by jerry jameson is one hell of a horrible film the script is deadly dull and there is no gore nor nudity this pointless piece of crap is so mind numbingly boring that you'll scratch your head in a total disbelief after suffering through it even the design of a man bat creature by a young stan winston is completely pathetic and unmemorable avoid this stinker like the plague 2 out of 10,0
disney and the wonderful folks at pixar of course offer a nice humourous story combined with the best of computer animation i admit that maybe the 'faces' of the bugs were a little more static than in 'antz' and they only had four legs in 'antz' six but backgrounds were superb and animation was breathtaking but let this be a lesson it was not the computer who made it such a success it was the man behind the machine who added the nice little twists which i missed in 'antz' some highlights were of course the 'bloopers' at the end so keep watching at the end it's worth it which were highly amusing and original the line 'filmed entirely on location' was intended for the more attentive viewer,1
you believe in god or you don't you believe in jesus or you don't you believe he is the son of god or you don't the choice is up to you br br director denys arcand has really done everything he could to bring back jesus to a mere historic figure social worker son of two humans instead of the son of god the holy spirit and mary who opened heaven again for us encouraging the big bang a world come from evolution instead of seeing the beauty of creation the film depicts a theologian bringing some modern findings to the actor who plays jesus in the passion play who happily incorporates them in his play br br the depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the passion play is performed in montreal has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the passion play instead of showing his love for god through celibacy more often than not the director's abhorrence of the church is clearly visible br br the director has tried to make a parallel between jesus' life and the passion play actor's life this is an admirable attempt but depicting the resurrection with the transplantation of the passion play actor's organs in other bodies signifies how the director thinks about jesus br br my opinion is not important god's opinion is but i wouldn't want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before jesus' throne,0
most movies about or set in new orleans turn out to be laughably bad and laughably inaccurate examble remember the savage bees but i'll make an exception for tightrope which almost got it right br br here's one that doesn't inevitably get it wrong the accents are not too bad yes the yat accent down here is way more brooklynese than southern the city of 1950 is shown the way it is was without the obligatory tourist shots and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a quirky southerner br br one of the few films to do justice to this city and a good film to boot,1
i loved this movie chris showerman did an amazing job not only is he an incredible actor but he is gorgeous with an awesome physique he did a great job on the delivery of his lines plus transformed into george better than fraser did a great performance for his first major roll this movie is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love my kids have watched this movie numerous times since we purchased the dvd the day it came out in addition to the movie the extras on the dvd are just as hilarious two thumbs up on this one i highly recommend it to everyone,1
arguebly al pacino's best role he plays tony montana a small time hood from cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in miami and he does it with the only two things he's got in this world his balls and his word and he doesn't break'em for nobody starts as doing jobs for a big time cuban dealer frank lopez robert loggia and quickly goes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friend manny steven bauer soon he has an eye for the boss's sexy wife elvira michelle pfeiffer after frank sees a threat from tony to his position he attempts to assassin tony but with no luck tony is upset and nothing can stop him now the film has a great supporting cast among them is f murray abraham as a jumpy gangster another familiar face is harris yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake down tony marry elizabeth mastrantonio as tony's young sister credits to the ecxellent screenplay by oliver stone this film is one of brian depalma's brightest points in his long ups and downs career you can see this guy is very talented the movie has a magnificent look to it also pay attention for two memorable scenes the one at the fancy restaurant say goodnight to the bad guy the other is the final shootout where tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 assassins that invaded to his house this is certainly one of the most impressive endings to a movie i have ever seen for fans of al pacino and crime movies it's a must see for the rest of you it's highly recommended 10 10,1
i'm a 53 year old college professor i went with my wife and 12 year old daughter we all enjoyed the movie the film is original witty fast paced and totally charming the plot was easy enough for a 10 year old to follow but twisty enough to keep an adult interested i thought emma roberts did a superb job and the rest of the cast was just fine my only criticism is that the los angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been they were functional but nothing stood out on the other hand make up costume lighting cinematography editing and directing were excellent altogether i thought it was a totally enjoyable experience i am disappointed that the professional critics almost all adult males savagely attacked the film apparently they have something against films that portray strong intelligent and independent young women their writings reveal more about their own sexist natures than anything about this wonderful family film i recommend it strongly to every child and every parent,1
the opening sequence is supposed to show the legion arriving in paris on 13 nov 1918 the troops pile off the train wearing the uniform in which the french army including the legion marched off to war in 1914 this a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey the french army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working metropolitan french troops were put into horizon blue and colonial troops were put into khaki the claude van damme sp remake at least got the uniforms more or less right really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right,0
first and foremost zorie barber zeke might be one of the worst actors i have ever seen as a character that's supposed to be a hip village writer into the martial arts and proud of being mysterious why is he so hyper over dramatic and plain horrible did he know anything about his character before they started filming did the director don't the martial arts teach discipline aside from that this film misses the target with its lame jokes and seen it already gross out humor hand in toilet i trainspotting i masturbation hmm i fast times at ridgemont high i i american pie i the list goes on bad dialogue in one sequence eric says it's none of my business i but i and 30 seconds later mia says why is this any of your business bad editing at least five minutes worth of film are wasted on nyc traffic shots hr it's also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a tight knit group of friends in any world i can't comment on what makes everyone laugh but if you enjoy low brow basic bathroom humor and insults by all means enjoy if you want something a little smarter but on the same lines see i boomerang i if you want a solid what goes around romantic comedy go for i the tao of steve i but anyone who thinks i whipped i is witty and an accurate portrayal dating well i cannot agree at all,0
br br i am a big time horror sci fi fan regardless of budget but after watching countless horror movies late night on cable and video this has to be the worst of all movies with bloody special effects what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that kept being shown over and over again and people running around screaming from left then to right then back again it should have stayed with the beginning convenience store scene and stopped there and been 15 minutes instead it is dragged out very long it is very very x5 low budget many scenes were way way too long narrator sounded very amateurish like a random person out of junior high was talking this is the only movie to rate lower in my opinion than manos red zone cuba benji and godzilla vs megalon despite their higher budgets 10 snoozes try to stay awake through whole movie in one setting or better yet avoid it like you would an undead brain eating mob the why did i ever see this piece of zombie dung blues epitome of nauseatingly bad made movies etc ad infinitum infinity 10,0
people forget that there have been several king kong ripoffs congo king kong vs godzilla king kong 1976 they all ripoff one another but yeti stands on its own it only borrows one element from king kong and that is the animal's attraction with one female br br the yeti myth is based on bigfoot not like king kong and archeologists have been fascinated it at one time they did exist but there is no scientific data to prove it br br this movie is hard to find but its worth watching it the first time i watched it was on elvira's mistress of the dark shows in the early 1980's it sent chills down my spine as a kid especially when the yeti got mad i saw it again around 1 00am on abc about 2 to 3yrs ago seeing it again made me appreciate it more it has some overall good effects for its time and the story involves a mute boy and his dog and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the yeti for his own purposes also the music is pretty cool its very yeti like br br gianfranco parolini and the yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere br br vote 7 and half out of 10,1
i appreciate movies like this smart and well crafted entertaining absorbing well acted and nicely directed nobody even pacino is chewing the scenery trying to stand out one of the film's most effective moments aielo pulling over at his beloved off ramp is chilling precisely because of its restraint br br not as good as say quiz show city hall is of a similar cloth engaging the mind as well as eye ear and heart why such well hewn entertainment flops at the box office is anybody's guess br br you know pacino does chew it up in one particular scene but precisely because it's required great scene too,1
i'm a rather pedestrian person with somewhat lowbrow tastes however i occasionally try to raise the bar on my cultural awareness this movie was one of my attempts i was in awe throughout the entire movie i liked it so much that i got my own tape so i could see it again this is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie i saw it as a huge question to the viewer what is the depth of sacrifice to duty one can accept can be asked to accept should accept as a military member this is of course an important question to me this question weighs heavily on the viewer of this movie br br recommended,1
the first time i saw this film i loved it when i was 11 i was more interested in the music and dancing as i've grown older i've become more interested in the acting as well while the first half is just a retrospective of michael's career from the jackson 5 up to bad it was still entertaining to watch the badder sequence could've been left out though the kids were pretty good speed demon and leave me alone were funny especially when the police officer tells michael i need your autograph right here after stopping him for dancing in a no dancing zone but it's smooth criminal that's the icing on the cake joe pesci did an excellent job as the toughie and that hair was wild the dancing is perfect and so are the special effects the only thing i could have done without was the spiders any fan of michael's should see this if you haven't already i give it a 10,1
my wife and i took our 13 year old son to see this film and were absolutely delighted with the winsome fun of the film it has extra appeal to boys and men who remember their childhood but even women enjoy the film and especially hallie kate eisenberg's refrain boys are so weird it's refreshing to see a film that unapologetically shows that boys and girls are indeed different in their emotional and social makeup boys really do these kinds of strange things and usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers silly we enjoyed the film so much that my son and an 11 year old friend myself and my daughters 23 year old boyfriend went to see the movie the next day for a guys day out we had even more fun the second time around and everyone raved about it it's clean and delightfully acted by a pre adolescent cast reminiscent of the tv classic freaks and geeks we all feel it will become a sleeper hit not unlike the freaks geeks which didn't survive its first season but sold out its dvd release do see it especially if you have boys and you'll find it stimulates conversation about fun and safety girls will love it because of the opportunity it affords to say boys are so weird don't miss it,1
letters with no destination end up in another world found in the back rooms of the post office here alice manages to land a job in hope of finding her lost father what she does discover is the tormented soul of her boss frank a quiet little aussie flic that came and went at the cinema now you find it in the deep dark corner of the video shop overshadowed by fifty copies of that dreaded godzilla film it's a shame because this turned out to be a satisfying film telling a brave tale with strong simple images and effective performances from the two leads this film succeeds where garry marshall's other dead letter office flic dear god 1996 usa failed and comes close to the brilliance of not the kevin costner turkey but he jianjun's postman 1995 china,1
richard dix is a big not very nice industrialist who has nearly worked himself to death if he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him can he find happiness for the last months of his life well he'll likely be better off if he disregards the voice of the whistler br br this william castle directed entry has some great moments the introduction and the depiction of richard dix's life through newsreel a la citizen kane and some intriguing plotting in the final reels dix's performance is generally pretty good but unfortunately the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do also the movie veers from a dark and fascinating beginning to an almost cheerful 30s movie like midsection full of nice urban ethnic types who don't mind that they aren't rich and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so br br this is a decent movie worth seeing but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role,0

this film is so much of a rip off of the masterpeice demons and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching the acting is terrible the action scenes are speeded up the script is almost painful and budget non existent br br if you think this film is good then you havn't seen a real horror film skip this and get a copy of the movie demons,0
this move is slow plodding cold dark and without a plot or hope it follows that tried and true european formula that they love to subsidize that is never seen but that the critics think makes an important point br br the movie is valuable if nothing more than to show the huge difference in the thinking between americans and europeans regarding employment in this movie the men are still nursing their wounds from years ago and feel it's the government's duty to provide them with work whereas in the u s we know we have to go out there and create value for someone br br spain never looked so backward,0

3lbs is obviously just a self indulgent programme for stanley tucci to be a producer moody deep doctor unlike house he has absolutely no personality and unlike grey's anatomy the brain surgery cases are't even interesting this programme is supposed to be set in a leading centre for neurlogical cases yet there's nothing interesting or exciting going on not even the so called pathetic 'feud' between him and a rival adds anything to the show and neither do those hallucinations in the pilot there was a brief glimpse into the leads's social life as a father snooze boring and pointless br br this show is pants there's a glut of medical dramas around at the moment and this does nothing to make it stand out as special,0
after an anonymous phone call about a spacecraft that would have crashed in a frozen wood two police officers find evidences that the event really happened and apparently one martian had walked away from the spot they drive to the nearby hi way café and they find a bus stopped and seven passengers waiting the reopening of a snowed in bridge however the driver tells that he had only six passengers when he parked the bus while interrogating the travelers weird things happen in the diner with the lights switching on and off and the turntable turning on and off when the passengers are released and the bus follows his travel one passenger returns to the diner and discloses a plot of invasion of earth br br will the real martian please stand up is one of the best episodes of this great series the intriguing story has ironic and witty dialogs funny characters and situations and a surprising and totally unexpected plot point in the very end my vote is eight br br title brazil o marciano the martian,1
the lion king series is easily the crowning achievement in disney animation the original lion king is the greatest masterpiece in cel animation lion king ii simba's pride is the by far the best direct to video sequel that disney or any other studio has made for an animated feature it deserved a theatrical release the same can be said for this movie it has the original cast songs by elton john a hilarious story exciting action and touching character moments everything you've come to expect from this series not so much a new story but filler and extended background on timon and pumbaa and their place in this story what impressed me the most was the care taken in the animation all to often disney shorts on the animation quality of their video and television efforts but here they seamlessly blend new animation with footage from the original film the scenes never seem out of place nathan lane and ernie sabella are in full swing as timon and pumbaa matthew broderick robert guillame and moira kelly reprise their roles as simba rafiki and nala respectively we even get a return visit by whoopi goldberg and cheech marin as the hyenas there are many big laughs in this movie so if you love lion king you need this movie the story is just not complete without it,1
i am a big fan of the movie but not for the usual reasons i think travolta and winger performed at higher than average rates i think the sets were representative of the location and the era i liked the sound track and the charlie daniels band however i think the photography was amazing since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and gilley's had low ceilings perhaps 10 12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a smoke filled bar hung 2 4 feet below the ceiling the camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors the bull the bar the women the dancing the low level of light that actually was in the bar what a feat sure there was auxiliary lighting but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar it had to be low light shots ray villalobos the camera operator was outstanding he got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film thanks ray great work,1

stylishly directed picturesquely photographed and brilliantly acted  crosby's interpretation seems exactly right hardwicke has his best role ever while bendix is a treat too  this yankee's appeal is universal and irresistible br br one of the principal joys of the movie of course are the songs as might be expected bing is in fine voice and although hardwicke's solo has been cut we can still hear him sing heartily as he dances merrily with crosby and bendix in their famous novelty number busy doing nothing it's also a treat to hear rhonda fleming who although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer was rarely given a chance to be heard in the cinema she has a lovely voice that more than matches her ravishing looksand she looks very fetching indeed in her mary kay dodson costumes br br director tay garnett gets the most out of his lavish budget using all the resources at his command to present every fabulous scene as effectively as possible perhaps the eclipse looks a trifle too contrived but who's complaining br br in short as the trailer actually describes an entertainment delight from start to finish,1
a perfect little atrocity i doubt if a single shot lasted for more then the reglamentary mtv 4 4 seconds woeful casting worse even than in kusminsky's version a reminder he managed to miscast juliet binoche and ralph feinnnes but hey the rich got what they deserved dark and brooding heathcliff reduced to the state of a golden locked angel frail and angellic catherine presented as a chubby melon breasted heffer meek and weak linton is a peeping tom and innocent isabel becomes sara michelle gellar's character from cruel intentions 15 year old eddie bauer and abercrombie and fitch donners take notice this thing was made for you it is an hour and a half long music video where everything is given to you you are saved from the uncomfortable necessity of not even trying to understand the complexity of the characters but even from initial shock at their actions the actors tried but as i stated before they were miscasted decent photography but editing is on the level of tv production class in high school i implore you all read the book or the cliffnotes even watch the previous versions of it even kusminsky's but stay away from the numerous future reruns during which you will not receive the benefit of the commercial free premiere,0
when someone remakes a classic movie the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original also there's a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences br br well the 1973 tv version of double indemnity has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original the main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all fred macmurray was great as the lecherous leering insurance agent walter neff in the original richard crenna just seems world weary and tired edward g robinson brought great manic energy to his role as macmurray's boss barton keys lee j cobb a fine actor appears almost bored with the proceedings samantha eggar is all wrong as the conniving back stabbing phyllis dietrichson while barbara stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place br br robert webber in the old richard gaines role as robinson's boss norton and john fiedler taking the porter hall role as the crucial witness bring some life to the movie in particular webber recreates the norton role well in a 1970s context br br however after the movie starts the whole thing just sort of lies there without any life or electricity this is one film that never should have been remade,0
while it certainly wasn't the best movie i've ever seen it was certainly worth the 8 which can't be said for many movies these days br br this was a pleasant account of a true story although many of the details of the real story were twisted for the movie ie billy sunday's character was three or four people in the real story combined together robert deniro was of course good and cuba gooding jr was also impressive,1

for the life of me i cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the jerry springer show it's so incrediably trashy some ways sadly it's a guilty pleasure we all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode it's part of our pop culture i saw this on usa recently it's pretty bad i will admit that jerry does a horrible job of what i think he meant as acting or something like it jamie pressley is in it she's playing herself basically all she needed was her lover boy kid rock it would've been perfect then so i would recommend skipping ringmaster just watch the jerry springer show it's more enjoyable than this br br 2 10,0

i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the 1930s in this beautiful film the story is simple an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children the faces of the actors are marvelous to see the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine which was more sophisticated and intricate the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism humanity and history portrayed,1

many mystery stories follow the standard whodunit path murder most foul gathering of clues gaggle of possible perps sprinkling of red herrings and inevitable showdown between clever evildoer and even more clever crime solver br br forgotten abandons the well trod and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts the fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly tied package might frustrate some but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale which probes disturbs and haunts with the question what does an evil person look like br br excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily forgotten,1
i think if you were to ask most jw's whether they expect a miracle cure because of their faith you will find they do not i know i do not what you will find instead is that they believe the promises christ made of a resurrection so even even if the worst were to happen and we die while holding onto our integrity jehovah can and will correct this br br it really gets down to a simple question is god real to you or is this all just make believe if he is real and you trust him you will follow his directions no matter what the short term outcome may be br br i had a heart attack about a year and a half ago one in my family was horrified when she saw the words no blood written in large letters over my chart i reasoned with her that if i were in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life would that be a good time to anger the only one could return me to life when the time came she didn't get it god just isn't real enough to her too bad i wish she could have the comfort a strong faith gives,1
this show is so incredibly hilarious that i couldn't stop watching the marathon on comedy central tonight despite the fact that i've seen all the episodes previously i've always regarded silverman as a huge talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience i watch this show and i laugh a very large percentage of the time i can't say that about many tv shows can you this show is finally something new and interesting and most importantly funny this is a show i will never miss and it is one i will buy on dvd as soon as it comes out you owe it to yourself to watch this show i predict a long run for this series and just to be clear the people who are offended by this show just don't get it perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they don't understand anyone who uses the word bigot in reference to silverman or who claims that she only aims to shock is way off the mark she's exactly the opposite just google her and you'll quickly see that she's a huge proponent of civil rights etc if you don't know that she's ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints you don't get it and if you don't get it do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity,1
there are so many words i want to use to describe this movie but can't really do that can i this movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit laugh cry and then pee i'm serious don't watch this movie if you're easily offended by profanity sex nudity homosexuality and everything else associated with nature being a woman and that might not even be a factor i can watch this movie over and over again trey parker and matt stone are absolutely brilliant along with all their other debuts i think baseketball is the prize winner i'm laughing now just thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the movie watch the movie that's all i'm going to say it's sort of hard for me to leave this comment because i'm one of those people like ozzy osbourne who has a curse word in almost every line that blurts out of their mouth when they speak so i'm keeping it professional best movie heck yeah,1
all dogs go to heaven is one of the best movies i've ever seen i first saw it when i was like 3 now i'm 12 and i rented it it makes me think of things and it brings back so many memories those were the days i love the music i love when charlie is arriving in heaven i love the song let me be surprised i love how charlie looks and his voice bert reynolds could only play charlie's voice this great i love this movie the 1st one is the best one because it's so original and great it really does bring back memories that no one can describe not even me if only i could go back to those days i love the characters if this is the way the memories come back when i'm 12 imagine how i'll feel when i'm like 19 i hope i'll be able to watch this when i'm older when i first seen this i never knew that i would really look back on it and feel this way i hope it will be available to watch i'm so happy that this movie was made and the amazing idea came to mind and heart on a scale from 1 10 i'd give it a perfect 10 it's an amazing movie it's so hard to explain the feeling when i get older and if i have kids i hope they can experience this feeling,1
such a film of beauty that it's hard to describe maybe it's the absence of superfluous dialogue or maybe it's the absolutely stellar soundtrack or maybe it's just meena mumari's feet but it's a joy to watch this movie again and again i've never seen another indian movie that comes close to it and few from any country rival its perfection,1
this does give away some of the plot by the way a charlie brown christmas is one of those timeless classics that teach you the value christmas and just enjoying the holiday this however does not it tries to capture the emotion of a charlie brown christmas there even is another christmas play but fails with lackluster and easy jokes charlie brown is no longer wondering about the spirit of christmas but is instead wants to buy a present for peggy jean 25 gloves what his sister sally is the most annoying character in the movie here is one of her jokes sally wants to write a letter to santa but doesn't know how to spell charlie for some reason he needs to be in her letter so instead decides to name him sam because she knows how to spell sam also sally plays an angel in the play with one word to day hark she instead says hockey stick har har if sally saying hark 12 times all oddly sounding exactly the same doesn't kill you nothing will peppermint patty and marcy are a large focal point but that hardly makes it better marcy is funny with her responses to patty but patty is another story she sounds like a boy which doesn't dispel the rumors and gets mad when she has to be the sheep in the play terrible baas and all apparently she is the sheep every year and is worried she will forget her lines lines she doesn't have she is so worried she mentions it twice one right after the other and gets the same response i'm assuming she must have short term memory loss or something lucy and linus are more welcome although linus still has annoying advice but hardly amount to much air time i'm sure schroeder isn't even in this one all in all it tries to be a parasite to the original but compromised the message for a few quick laughs,0
michael keaton has really never been a good actor in the tim burton batman movies he always falls in the shadows of his great villains here he stars as a widowed husband that picks up radio frequencies that seems like is dead people that tries making contact with the living br br well this is supposed to be a pretty shocking thriller but it really misses about every spot there is shocking you because there's way too much stuff that ends up unexplained undiscovered and uninteresting so where's the shocking excitement when it all gets so bad movie made in the first place that white noise makes a fool out of itself truly bad acting and horrifying edited this movie is nothing to watch michael keaton tries making a thriller comeback but ends up missing the target more than ever,0
i saw this movie when i was really little it is by far one of the strangest movies i have ever seen now normally i like weird movies but this was just a bit too much br br there's not much of a plot to the movie if anything it starts out like toy story where toys come to life and raggedy ann and andy go on an adventure to rescue their new friend babette from there craziness ensues there's the greedy the looneys a sea monster named gazooks and a bunch of pirates singing show tunes all of which just made the movie weirder also i can't help but feel that babette is annoying and a bit too whiny she definitely didn't help the movie br br now even though i didn't like this movie there were a few cute parts i liked the camel's song even though it was a song about being lonely it had a friendly feel to it then there was sir leonard while most of the looneys were just plain nuts sir leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest king koo koo was just a little dirtbag that made dr evil look like a serious villain also there was raggedy andy's song no girl's toy it was definitely good song for little boys who wanted to act tough but honestly even these things didn't make the movie any better but remember this is just my perspective br br while i personally wouldn't recommend this movie even i have to admit it does have its charming moments see it if you're interested but only if you're in the mood for something really out of the ordinary,0
this mess is so bad it doesn't even qualify as horror br br debbie rochon's talent is completely wasted in this film she is not even the villain the rest of the actors look like porno wannabes and the plot is so lame i won't even mention it br br do yourself a favor and skip to the end credits to hear upcoming band twomarlowe perform better than sex it's total 80's disco candy song nice up tempo song about gambleing sex way more entertaining than bleed put it this way when one has the equipment to copy videos but decides only to record the song at the end of movie you have a really bad movie,0
i am surprised than many viewers hold more respect for the sequel to this brilliant movie i have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best br br even though ive seen the making of i still have doubts when watching those 35mins of pure torture its that powerful br br a 10 out of 10 because this movie achieved perfectly what it set out to do be the best fake snuff film ever made,1
okay i've always been a fan of batman i loved the animated series and even batman beyond i even read a batman comic now and then so as can be imagined i was a little excited when i heard about this series and then i was severely disappointed this series is nothing it doesn't even begin to compare with the original series it's like one long toy commercial no depth whatsoever and what the heck was with the joker who in my most humble opinion is the best batman villain of all time and they killed him i wish i could say his design was the worst part actually i wish i could say there was anything about this series that was remotely creative or interesting in short because believe me i could say so much more do not waste your time on this show or your money,0
end of the world is an uneventful movie which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth the main character is some kind of scientist i'm not exactly sure what kind he has two jobs at a government facility guarded by four security men his first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job 2 job 2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room at least that's the best i can figure apparently the plant is not exactly top secret as the scientist brings his wife there she hangs out they're on their way to a dinner while he discovers a message from space major earth disruption repeated over and over he says something about it being the first message from space he's ever been able to decipher his wife tells him they're going to be late for the dinner party so they leave and go to the party moments later he finds out that china has suffered a major earthquake from there the movie goes nowhere yes christopher lee is in it but that really doesn't help much besides lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in howling ii this movie is boring but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like christopher lee or z grade sci fi plus there's lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed,0
in die nibelungen siegfried siegfried was betrayed now kriemhild seeks revenge she marries hagen and through a series of events finally engages in a very drastic but fitting action at the end br br one of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at certain portrayals attila the hun called etzel in the movie is shown as the strange person from the east possibly an allusion to the soviet union obviously it was not fritz lang's fault that hitler used the nibelungenlied for german national pride in the third reich but one can see what the fuhrer liked about the story nonetheless this is an absolutely formidable movie,1
i simply cant understand why all these relics from the ceausescu era refuse to let go one can see clearly how frustrated they were during the commie censorship that forbade them so many things to show in their movies and now they imagine its dunno what big deal of artsy fartsy freedom so fill the screen with people defecating urinating vomiting swearing and any other kinds of hideousness imaginable this is not cinema friends and neighbors this is simply visual perversion forget about bunuels chien andalou about david lynch about forman and neorealism and other movie makers who were able to work with an aesthetics of ugliness those people were mastering their jobs well you don't do us a favor all you daneliucs and nicolaescus and saizescus and muresans and marinescus and margineanus and other obsolete old timers and leave us alone its bit time to see some romanian movies on screen enough with your immature terribilisms you are not directors you are illiterate,0
largely dense road movie with some comic relief provided by the excellent john cleese although he is really sending up his performance in fawlty towers seems to flip from over the top slapstick to slushy sentimentality at the drop of a hat and the worst part of the film is that martin and hawn have to find themselves who they are etc see it at your peril,0
this is a smart drama about the way of life in a texas honky tonk in the early 1980's john travolta and debra winger turn out two very believable performances as bud and sissy davis this film really opens up the country music scene and helped introduce america to the mechanical bull if you love a good romance film then you will love this movie,1
gurinda chada's semi autobiographical film 2002 is a gentle poignant comedy set in the ethnically diverse community near heahthrow airport in west london br br like the airliners which constantly arrive and depart from overhead we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters jess bhamra parminder nagra and jules paxton keira knightley as they strike up an unlikely friendship which centres around their mutual passion for soccer and their technical infatuation with david beckham br br much of the comedy grows out of the misunderstandings of the families of these two talented girls as they break all the expectations and conventions of their very different family backgrounds br br somewhere in the middle as broker peacemaker and blighted athlete joe jonathan reece myers team coach for the hounslow harriers intercedes in times of crisis while at the same time remaining the main object of affection of both the main characters br br eventually and not without many obstacles and triumphs on the way we finally see our dedicated and beloved soccer heroines soaring away to realise their dreams br br with great performances from bollywood veteran anupam kher mr bhamra shaheen khan mrs bhamra juliet stevenson mrs paxton and frank harper mr paxton this really is a film that captures the urgent passion of adolescence and crosses all ethnic frontiers br br pinky bamrha archie panjabi and taz trey farley are struggling their own struggles but nevertheless contribute greatly to our understanding of the main characters in the film br br in it's own special way this film tells an important story that in quite incidental the football it celebrates the evolution in the understanding of ordinary people in ordinary families and the innate ability of the young to teach the old,1
to summarize this movie without a real plot this movie consists of 80 minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes the music is just awful the humor isn't funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks it seems to me that the movie has actually been written by a 14 year old boy who thinks that drinking is cool women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks also the movie has nothing to do with the original american pie movies other than a few names and mr levenstein who is a minor character in this one the only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls don't watch this movie and don't be fooled by the 5 4 rating because it obviously overrated and doesn't deserve anything above 2,0
forget neo and bourne and all those half baked made up modern heroes they only look 12 year oldish to please the wide audience of geeks that want to be their heroes since they cannot be rambo or mcclane or even indiana jones hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick br br however their action set pieces are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their masculinity without question this explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screens over the past few years for better rocky rambo or worse die hard 4 where john mcclane brace yourselves had no beard br br i say it is high time a new hero walked up and put their reign to an end this largo winch movie is far from perfect and perhaps too predictable at times but at least tomer sisley delivered a very promising performance as an action hero and the only one time where he was weakened is when mélanie thierry shaved his beard i rest my case br br i didn't know it when i entered the theater room but this might be the movie i've been waiting for a decade for the first time in france since belmondo can a movie be both well crafted and rooted in b genre without blushing over its performance in the meantime all we had to chew on was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too restricted to reach a wider audience in other words it was le pacte des loups or dobermann i like dobermann mind you i believe largo winch has what it takes to be both popular and quality film making br br i exited the theater room very pleased and hungry for more,1
not one of your harder hitting stories and that's a real strength of this film there are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all too predictable romantic tension they not only spare the audience this but throw in some surprises at the same time there are a few disney ish moments particularly near the end but they are manageable overall it was worth the rental and it was good relaxed fun br br btw if you get the dvd watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi we followed her directions and it was brilliant next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it because this is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out,1
i thought this was an awesome movie the theme song is sweet anyway the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning when everything should have been normal it was very weird and unrealistic the big cable company is mainly what i'm talking about apart from that the movie was very creative i think that all the acting was well done the actors acted out their characters' personalities perfectly everything fit together well it really is a shame that their isn't a soundtrack that would have been great because this is a canadian film and because it is one of my favorites i give this movie a 10 out of 10,1
i really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but wow did it turn corny or should i say just plain stupid this is just another example of outdated humor it might have been funny in 1940 but not now not even close br br dick powell is always interesting to watch i especially liked him once he started switching from his boyish looks and high voice of the busby berkeley musicals to where he's mature and sounds it too br br he was fine as jimmy macdonald but the rest of the cast just played stupid characters the worst being the boss raymond walburn of the maxford house coffee company who did nothing but shout all the time he was brutal to hear and was a big detriment to the movie,0
actually this movie has silly moments both in the claymation part and in the joe pesci and children part and it's much worse than other mj movies like the wiz captain eo and ghosts but as a die hard michael jackson fan since almost eleven years yeah that's half my life you guys i can't complain too much about it just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me but as a movie it's not good at all and i'm afraid that it would get a much lower grade for me if my darling mike hadn't been the one starring in it but since no one but mike is the moonwalker it has to get a 7 out of 10 from me,1
i had watched as much of the series as i could manage to watch on television but unfortunately started a job that got me working evenings i managed to catch some recordings of it at least and of course purchased the recently released dvd of the complete series watching the dvd you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at first but they ironed out a fair number of the flaws after the pilot was done the voices are well suited to the characters and the writing is excellent it's rather refreshing to see animation getting back to it's roots by reintroducing adult themes thing is with the way society has come in the last century you need to be a bit more blatant about it by today's standards in order to be recognised as an adult oriented show the characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that parallel what we often face in real life it's your typical sitcom in that regard but the humor is more like what you'd expect from late night television like a talk show skit or saturday night live back when snl was actually funny good job dreamworks perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going and also improve the marketing of merchandise for the series to help defray it's high costs it's a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature though hmm,1
if unlike some of the commenters here you are not staging a class war and don't mind seeing the lives of other people who are fairly successful extroverted bohemian gasp and not being terribly english at a party and getting into all sorts of trouble as a result this is not a bad film closer to euro cinema rather than an imitation of the usual slick american crap i believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making i'd defend this the film isn't any worse as a result and it puts the spotlight on the cast some of whom are really good kate hardie think that's her name as the sarcastic drunk is spot on the one exception being david baddiel who should never be allowed to appear in serious stuff it's light and we don't go for this kind of anatomising of relationship crap in this country but if you don't have any real friends to go to a party with than you could do worse than to sit in and watch this,1
despite its stereotypes virtually 'no name' cast and an obviously low budget i thought this film was alright much better than i expected it to be i was skeptical at first the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me but in the end i thought the film handled the concept well even if some scenes were a little clichéd br br the cast was quite good and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously i couldn't help thinking though that janine turner is a bit of a geena davis look a like maybe it's just her face or the make up hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time br br while it's not a 'must see' or a great film by any standard 'fatal error' is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end,0
i felt this film throughout i waas impressed with russell crowe's talent in developing his relationship with lillie such a typical aussie blend of softly softly approach a bit self depreciating and very persistent really loved the cinematography and direction pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressive br br gosh didn't russell's talent even in 1993 shine and i have yet to see gladiator,1

i'm not sure quite why i clicked contains spoiler because quite honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough of what is supposed to be going on to spoil it br br visually it mostly delivers well apart from some 80's throwback rubber mask monsters i'll say now that before watching this i had never seen the band lordi nor knew anything about them bar that they won eurovision apparently the monsters in this are members of the band pretty much in their stage personas whatever anyway i didn't know this while watching i just thought the monsters demons were mostly passable just about br br i'm almost sure there is a semi coherent explanation behind what we see on screen but it may actually be better not to know it it probably would actually have been incredibly lame come to think on it the action keeps it rolling along pretty much well enough to keep the viewer mostly entertained even if half the entertainment factor is joking about wtf is supposed to be happening in this movie exactly br br i gave it a four mainly because i got a good laugh out of it especially out of how it explains pretty much nothing must have been the mood i was in but i found that hella funny for some reason then i look up the movie on the internet and find out that nobody knows what the hell it's supposed to be about that amused me further and raised my score an extra half point to a 4 10 br br it's not scary or particularly coherent but it's pretty nice visually and sonically overall far from essential but watchable don't expect too much and don't expect it to make any sense and it might entertain you if you are in the right mood,0
words can't describe how bad this movie is i can't explain it by writing only you have too see it for yourself to get at grip of how horrible a movie really can be not that i recommend you to do that there are so many clichés mistakes and all other negative things you can imagine here that will just make you cry to start with the technical first there are a lot of mistakes regarding the airplane i won't list them here but just mention the coloring of the plane they didn't even manage to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline but instead used a 747 painted in the original boeing livery very bad the plot is stupid and has been done many times before only much much better there are so many ridiculous moments here that i lost count of it really early also i was on the bad guys' side all the time in the movie because the good guys were so stupid executive decision should without a doubt be you're choice over this one even the turbulence movies are better in fact every other movie in the world is better than this one,0
surely one the french films of the decade so far a taut atmospheric thriller making full use of the lead characters hearing impediment to use sound in a way rarely explored in cinema emannuelle devos gives a truly stunning multi faceted performance at times devious and manipulative at other times open and vulnerable another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for offerings from france,1
stan ollie become saps at sea when their wayward little boat is commandeered by a vicious murderer br br the boys are wonderful in this feature which starts out with one of their most hilarious set pieces the horn factory always a few steps out of sync with the rest of creation laurel hardy inhabit a world where icy radios bedded billy goats are the rule not the exception with its brief length the film is more in style with their classic short subjects which explains its episodic nature br br only the boys get screen credit but movie mavens will recognize other familiar faces james finlayson appears as a loony doctor richard cramer does full justice to his bad guy role sweet mary gordon plays the boys' perplexed neighbor that's charlie hall as the apartment house desk clerk and silent screen comic ben turpin portrays a most peculiar plumber br br one of the film's script writers was silent comedian harry langdon br br stan ollie are the main focus however watching hardy go berserk at the sound of a horn or laurel's antics with bananas for instance reminds the viewer why these fellows remain absolute cinematic giants,1
prince stars as 'the kid' in this semi autobiographical film of a talented but narcissistic young musician who has a less then stellar home life true the acting leaves a tad to be desired barring morris day and especially clarence williams who are both pitch perfect but the movie is still great and among the best to come out of the 1980s it has the best soundtrack of any movie of the last 50 years at least highly quotable lines and the dumpster scene is hilarious plus apollonia is just simply stunning on an unrelated not when i saw prince in concert in 2004 he blew down the stadium he is an expert showman and it was one of the best concerts that i've experienced br br my grade a br br dvd extras disc 1 commentary with director albert magnoli producer robert cavallo director of photography donald thorin theatrical trailer trailers for under the cherry moon and grafitti bridge disc 2 a 12 minute featurette on the first avenue club purple rain bachstage pass a half hour featurette on the movie which i'll review later on it's page riffs raffs and revolution the impact and influence of purple rain 10 minute featurette 30 minutes of mtv's premiere footage when mtv didn't suck donkey balls 5 prince music videos let's go crazy take me with you when doves cry i would die 4 u baby i'm a star and purple rain 2 videos by the time jungle love and the bird and a music video for sex shooter by apollonia 6 br br eye candy apollonia shows her fine ass titties,1
sudden impact tends to be treated as eastwood's artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director the reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support in some places it actually owes more to death wish than the original dirty harry film one might argue if that is so at the end of the day it's a film about guilt justice and retribution for me at the end of the day it's more empathy than sympathy however in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film forget the go ahead punk make my day scene that's iconic but not original but look at the views of san fransisco taken from the air zooming in on the city the first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where sondra locke's character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces so all in all sudden impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature eastwood is as a director and if i remember correctly it was actually the first time eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology also i think this is the first well paced film eastwood directed although eastwood has enormous talent as a director dramaturgy has always been his weak point see play misty for me breezy etc thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story the only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog,1
one two three four five six seven eight and back haha this is a must see first of all to see the work out there are a lot of work out shown see those close ups man you will enjoy it a few years ago a video clip was surely based on this movie it's a slasher but without suspense the ending is funny too and the clothes she's wearing in the wood confronting the copper jesus looks like a clown the killings are mostly done off screen the blood flows but never too gory there are a lot of fight scene's too and hey no one got hurt and what about the weapon to kill never seen a big one like that won't spoil it you must see it and being a slasher there's a lot of t a too to guess who's the killer you will be trapped a few times and that's the best part but what about the story of the copper in the woods huh but still due his cheesiness this one is still one that many would like to have i'm glad that i have my copy one of those slasher failures but man those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles if you are in your 40's then this is one is back to memory lane,0
a young man named court is loved by everyone his painful bloody death brings everyone closer you can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie whether predictable or not and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs this is a moving story full of milieu and sensuality br br one other thing someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it didn't seem plausible but the elements for this are set up subtly note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves he is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment to this day tractors are pretty dangerous,1
i was really disappointed with this film the first waters movie i saw was serial mom and i loved it then i saw pecker and i loved it then i watched polyester and really sort of hated it the only thing i liked about that movie was divine she he had a hell of a lot of talent i was truly surprised as a whole i wouldn't recommend this film,0
question how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers walther mathau in full furious and brilliant grumpy old man mode answer quietly deadpan and with perfect timing as george burns does here br br i know nothing of vaudeville but this remains a favourite film the two leads are hilarious the script funny the direction and pacing very fine richard benjamin is very funny as straight man trying to get at burns through the window etc even the small parts are great br br there are so many funny scenes mathau messing up the commercial burns repeating his answers as if senile br br a delight br br enterrrrrr,1
what else can you say about this movie except that it's plain awful tina louise and adam west are the reasons why to see this but that's it but their talents are wasted in this junk i think that they used a double in some of adam's scenes like when he's running because you can't see his face if adam was embarrassed in being in zombie nightmare just think what he must've felt about appearing in this if it was before or after i'm not sure but still zombie nightmare is a classic check out the mystery science theater 3000 version first and last compared to this the gang is very annoying and over acting by some of the actors a rip off of the wild one starring marlon brando of course tina looks stunning though i hope her and adam got a good paycheck pass,0
nina foch insists that my name is julia ross in this 1945 film noir also starring dame may witty and george macready it's short and because it is the film suffers it could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer br br when i was growing up foch was a fixture on television playing a neurotic woman the wife with the cheating husband the nervous wreck she became one of the great acting teachers in los angeles here she's a pretty young ingenue playing the title role julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by mrs hughes and her son ralph little does she know though we learn immediately that the employment agent is a front set up to get just the right woman for this assignment a woman with no family and no boyfriend br br it's a live in situation once julia gets to the house she's drugged and when she wakes up she's told she's mrs hughes and not allowed to leave br br the acting is very good low budget but still entertaining some things particularly at the end happen way too quickly which is why i said the movie is too short nevertheless i recommend it,1
valliant effort to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle to pronounce this director's distaste for war the audience not only learns a great deal about early mining rescue procedures but we learn that europeans at the interval between wwi and wwii had concerning pacifists for lack of a better term the speeches given by both representatives of each country at the end of the film are inspiring given the time although the revised edition through the transfer technology of early foreign films cuts off characters heads at times this film holds it's own in many different aspects character analysis lighting techniques historical content and a scenario that has tested and inspired many a writer and filmmaker br br pabst went on to direct and put to screen weil brecht's three penny opera starring the original star lotte lenya,1
this is a great film from reading other reviews i can see that i'm not the only one who shed a tear tamilyn tomita acted with such skill and conviction she made the ending heartfelt and memorable in the hands of a lesser actress her last scene would have seemed trite and corny one would never guess this film was done on a tight limited budget the cinematography is gorgeous and there are a number of big name actors the script is so wonderful i can see why they all wanted to be in it if you watch the long long list of credits at the end you'll see that half of hawaii pitched in to make this film happen and for good reason the soundtrack available on cd is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the film my only complaint is that i almost didn't want the film to end,1
this is the last time i rent a video without checking in at the imdb reviews the limey is directed by steven soderbergh who also wrote wrote the truly awful nightwatch with ewan macgregor and directed such trash as out of sight with the anti talented jennifer lopez terence stamp is a fine actor and it is a shame he involved himself in such a bad film there is frequent confusing editing that seems like it was a last minute decision in order to make up for the lack or story filming and just plain common sense this film does everything wrong what were they thinking,0
loyalty to peter falk is all that kept me from giving this awful picture the 1 it deserved for that matter loyalty to mr falk was what kept me watching this film all the way from heads to tails even if you forgive all the glaring errors this was just plain the poorest excuse for a made for tv columbo film ever i'm glad i watched it on tv for free would have hated to have coughed up the bucks for a print,0
he was my hero for all time until he went along with if you can call it a movie i went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero's acting and the hole thing was i can't believe that steven segal's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong br br the plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel you'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book br br steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation he shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all br br i hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic the condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner br br my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds i read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget segal being paid 5 of that and that the movie still came in under budget i must concur br br it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie,0
too many secondary plot lines without a primary one too many hot buttons are pushed without any reason they managed to stuff this boring film that does not say anything with every drama element that is out there death divorce money issues parenting problems suicide psychological problems drug abuse adoption rejected love traveling problems sex generations misunderstandings robbery legal issues guns medical ethics deep real love  you would think that it would make for an interesting movie but hell no  all these events are secondary to something primary which is not there boring not to mention that the super deep and super long lecture to the child at the end of the film is a total nonsense pity br br oh forgot to mention the actors all of them are quite good that's what kept me from turning it off to bad their talents went to waste the film is well shot too the light the motion etc of every episode that's all in place it's just the meaning that's missing,0
this film has its good points hot chicks people die br br the problem the hot chicks barley get nude and you don't get to see many of the people dieing mostly just lots of fast movements and screaming though there were two good kill scenes br br also for those of you watching this for jenna jameson she is just a side chearator with a very small role and minor nude scenes br br what this film needed script and story would be nice but i will not complain about that simply put it needs more nudity and better kill scenes cuz lets face it that is why we watch these flicks br br i wouldn't waste my money on it and if you must wait until it's on the old shelves at your local video store,0
i just did not enjoy this film but then i loved babe a pig in the city and have been spoiled by talking animal films that are exceptionally well done in every way the animals were not likeable they were all irritating especially chris rock's guinea pig but then what could i expect it's chris rock i believe i smiled once or twice at a couple cute lines but that's it,0
did anyone read the script this has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year three great actors paul giamatti rachel weisz and miranda richardson couldn't pull this one out about two thirds it looked like giamatti eyes were saying i can't believe i signed the contract it's not the worst movie i ever saw but it's on the really really bad christmas movie list not enough lines but what else can be said okay the movie just doesn't move with vaughn's con man dialogue his character is just a creepy guy that you just can't get past it was just a lackluster walk through that no one seemed to be able to get into,0
i saw this film while at birmingham southern college in 1975 when it was shown in combination with the red balloon both films are similar in their dream like quality the bulk of the film entails a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner a little boy is away at school a cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are and begins to warily stalk his prey the boy begins his walk home from school and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend the fish becomes agitated by the cat's presence and finally jumps out of the bowl the cat quickly walks over to the fish gently picks him up with his paws and returns him to his bowl the boy returns happily to his fish none the wiser br br the ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity it is hard to imagine how the director could've pulled the technical feat back in 1959 it seems more a trick for 2003 br br if you can find it watch it you won't be disappointed and if you do find it let me know so i can get a copy too,1
the one thing that occurred to me after watching this drivel was i would never get the time i used to watch this back again if you want to see stacey keach and michael dorn try and earn what must have been then the down payments on a holiday home then stay tuned wooden acting poor special effects the only comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is over as soon as she has done her obligatory b movie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie the opportunity to have made what could have been a decent movie disappears the moment nicole eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds whilst the police military and joe public don't cotton on that the woman drinking coffee dosn't use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once she must obviously be from another planet just where i wish i was when this movie was on,0
as a fan of eric rohmer's studies of the contemporary war between the sexes i was very eager to see the lady and the duke l'anglaise et le duc for how he would treat men and women during a real war the french revolution br br the film looks beautiful with each scene designed as a period painting like a tableaux vivant and i expected much talking as that's rohmer's style but maybe rohmer was restrained by basing the screenplay on a real woman's writings is why this mostly felt like a docudrama version of the scarlet pimpernel br br as awful as the excesses of robespierre et al how about some recognition that the french aristocrats were spoiled brats i kept humming to myself marat we're poor and the poor stay poor you could also pick a tune from les miz br br i wasn't all that sympathetic as the central figure has to go back and forth between her city home and country manor to stay ahead of the revolution at one point her maid claims the pantry is bare but sure manages to lay out a fine repast i simply didn't understand her an english sympathizer who alternately rejects and defends her former lover and patron as he and the revolution keep shifting political focus i think i was supposed to sympathize with her consistency more than their political machinations like a character out of the scarlet pimpernel hey the only reason she didn't go back home was her disgrace after an affair and child with the prince of wales or somebody br br usually in a revolutionary period there's some groundswell of change going on in relations between men and women but i saw none here i once went to a herbert marcuse lecture that concluded with a lengthy q a the last question from an audience member far older than the rest of us acolytes heck she had gray hair was why are revolutionaries so grim she was hooted at and marcuse didn't deign to respond to it seriously but it's the only thing of substance i remember from the whole evening rohmer demonstrates that counter revolutionaries are also grim and didactic br br originally written 8 11 2002,0
the title got my attention and then i wondered what will come out in the plot as we have seen so many super people movies these years and in fact i really liked it as there were a number of unusual funny scenes that i didn't expect uma thurman performed as average in g girl's role surprisingly i was again able to watch her toes in wide screen like in the beginning of kill bill luke wilson however played very well the idiot everyday guy who meets the big woman i could really get into his situation if you want a light touch of fun you should definitely watch g girl's and average matt's adventures especially to cheer up your partner 7 10 in my collection,1
now please don't start calling me names like unpatriotic weirdo and more br br the very length of this movie 4 hours is its biggest mistake no editing at all seems like j p dutta fell in love with his project too much even lagaan was 4 hours long but it was entertaining and gave a message as well br br it's based on true incidents and real people kudos to it but were the repetitive war scenes really needed on top of it the focus constantly shifted from one battalion squadron to another and it was impossible to keep a track of them all br br between the skirmishes there were songs about loneliness lovesickness and related stuff there were chummy conversations in the beginning it gave some relief from the violence but became so monotonous later that one could even correctly predict nature of the forthcoming talk br br why were the soldiers walking around as if they were lions in jungle fully unaware that enemy was lurking somewhere near and when they were shot it elicited sympathy but it seemed unmindful of them to be so cocksure of their safety in the first place br br music was melodious and the lyrics were soulful but did not fit with the movie better to listen to them on the soundtrack rather than in the movie br br acting was the saving grace from seasoned veterans like sanjay dutt and ajay devgan to relative newbies like abhishek bachchan and akshaye khanna everyone acted like a pro manoj bajpai and ashutosh rana deserve a special mention for lightening up the mood whenever necessary br br dialogues ranged from brilliant from madhuri with love to illogical monotonous pakistan se zyada musalman hindusthan mein hain and the expletive spree consisting of all the mcs bcs cs and f words wasn't really required br br loc kargil attempts to provide a fitting tribute to the brave indian soldiers but tries too hard and ultimately fails indian soldiers surely deserve a better tribute,0
barbara stanwyck gives this early douglas sirk directed universal produced soap just the kick that it needs not nearly as memorable as sirk's later melodramas it's easy to see by watching all i desire where sirk would be heading artistically in the next few years stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to her family in smalltown u s a after deserting them a decade earlier her family and community have mixed emotions in dealing with her shocking return some of the cinematography is amazing and stanwyck is tough as nails and really gives this film a shot of energy overall a fairly good show,1
i thought that i was never going to find a horror movie as bad as the return of the texas chainsaw massacre but this film compete with it br br i´m not a person that get asleep when watching a movie but i did it 15 minutes after the trance started i woke up and started to watching it agian why did i deserve that all the movie was a torture i have to use fast forward to watch it complete br br i can´t stand why one of my favourites actors of all time mr walken could done this thing i have to think that he made the director a favor or he was really in the need of money because film after film he is doing he is ruining himself and so fast br br what about the movie it´s not scary stupid plot characters are awful but i really liked the one played by jared harris effects are very poor lack of deaths blood etc in three words it has anything and i mean it can´t stand how a director can make a film like this br br anyway when i got more disappointed was when i saw in the video cover that the film was presented by stephen king i think he could never present this crap no i rented it in argentina i not recommend it in a million years br br i rate this movie with a 2 out of 10 as i say in my return of the texas chainsaw massacre review there will be always a worse movies thats why it don´t deserves a 1 out of 10,0
let's see in the st elsewhere finale we found out that there was no hospital and that every thing had been in the mind of an autistic child newhart ended by telling us that it had all been a dream and roseanne ended by telling us that it all had taken place in her mind very creative annoying was more like it yes it was just a tv show and wasn't at all reality it's just that when you get caught up in a great movie or tv show you end up at least wanting to believe that it's all real at least as far as the reality it portrays on screen this type of series finale had been done twice before and was old hat frustrating and simply not fun to watch now newhart being all a dream at least done in a creative way that far exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show the idea itself was not too engaging but it was so brilliantly done that its arguably the best series finale ever roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan,0
today if someone mentions the name victor mclaglen the response most likely will be who or perhaps why well believe it or not victor mclaglen won the academy award for best actor in this film which is about a poor desperate man who is willing to sell out his best friend for carfare to the united states it's an interesting movie which shows how low even the most well meaning shnooks will go just for a few bucks the movie takes place in british dominated ireland and while all the other characters are either directly or indirectly fighting for the political independence of ireland all mr mclaglen's character is concerned about is getting money and getting drunk the movie makes one wonder whether political activism is worth all the trouble because while the activist is struggling to make a point many others not only do not care they don't even know what the fuss is all about the morale of this movie is look out for the friend he may sell you out for a dime,1
did they use their entire budget paying the porno stars or what br br sound effects background music and the editing in general was so bad you'd think some 12 year old wanna be made the film br br most of the acting was good considering the script the innocent virgin played her part really well br br the mutants look really cool and this actually could have been a really cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel but unfortunately for all involved that's not the case br br turn left was made better than this movie and those guys didn't even have any money good thing i didn't rent the movie myself,0
this is a quirky little movie and i have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well br br it follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous las vegas illusionist and is partly about following his dream partly about the dreams of others and all about the travails of showbiz i thought the movie was charming and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worthwhile br br alan arkin is terrific as the magician who never was and his mentoring of max makes for a funny and touching relationship br br not for everyone probably but if you like movies about the journey then i think you'll like this one,1
once again disney manages to make a children's movie which totally ignores its background about the only thing common with this and the original gadget cartoons is the names the most glaring errors are the characters penny does not have her book brain has been reduced from a character to a fancy prop dr claw is more a show off than an evil villain etc but there are more than that the horrors start from the first minutes of the film having gadget as a security guard called john brown doesn't help identifying him as the classic inspector gadget and right in the beginning we see disney's blatant attempt to turn every story ever into a love affair between a man and a woman they introduce brenda who only serves to make this movie disney compatible add to this the fact that the claw seen in this film and the classic dr claw are almost diagonally opposite and you'll see this is going to be nowhere near the original storyline what would help would be a better storyline to replace it but as you guessed disney failed in that too the whole movie is just gadget acting silly for silliness's sake and lusting after brenda as if to add insult to the injury disney introduced the new gadgetmobile it doesn't look function or think like the old gadgetmobile at all it's just the canonical comic relief figure disney obviously recognised that the gadget cartoons were a comedy so they made the film a comedy too but they took out all the clever running gags like the assignment paper exploding in the chief's face and replaced them with gadget being a moron the gadgetmobile being a wise ass and claw showing off someone should tell disney that children's movie doesn't imply total lack of any brain usage gadget should be targeted for children of 10 12 years not children of 10 12 months like this movie whatever this movie is supposed to be it is not repeat not the real inspector gadget because i love the old gadget i hate this,0
hey babu riba is a film about a young woman mariana nicknamed esther after a famous american movie star and four young men glenn sacha kicha and pop all perhaps 15 17 years old in 1953 belgrade yugoslavia the five are committed friends and crazy about jazz blue jeans or anything american it seems br br the very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties in the wake of changing communist politics they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 the year before the film was made br br i enjoyed the film with some reservations the subtitles for one thing were difficult especially in the beginning there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all perhaps the conversational pace required it but i couldn't always both read the text and absorb the scene which caused me to not always understand which character was involved i watched the movie a video from our public library with a friend and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative br br this yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability idealism and strong and loyal bonds to each other there is a main flashforward and it was intriguing keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis a vis the 1953 cast and what had actually happened br br i would rate it 7 out of 10 and would like to see other films by the director jovan acin 1941 1991,1
this was not the worst movie i've ever seen but that's about as much as can be said about it it starts off with some good atmosphere the hospital is suitably sterile and alienating the mood is set to eerie and then nothing well somethings just somethings that clearly don't fit in and no effort is made to clarify the connection between the bizarre and yet not particularly intimidating critters and the hospital they've taken over i mean come on biker duds some band watched a bit too much gwar br br my personal favorite was the head demon who looks rather a lot like a middle aged trucker desperately attempting menace while simultaneously looking like he'd really like prefer to sag down on an afghan covered couch undo his belt pop a can of cheap beer probably schlitz and watch the game honestly i've seen far scarier truckers at truckstops drinking coffee wwwwoooooohhhhhhoooooooo scary br br the other monsters are even more cartoonish and even less scary at least on the dvd the videos give some explanation of their presence in the hospital they apparently just randomly pop up in places play some bippy metal and cause people to be dead a bit barring a few good special effects and acting that is not entirely terrible given a lack of decent writing there's just nothing here it's a background noise movie only,0
this is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see i thought it was just another documentary but it really is something else it doesn't try to teach you anything it shows you how life works in nature br br i won't talk about the quality of the pictures because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatched br br earth is funny tense and sad it can make you laugh it can make you cry sometimes both at the same time this is the first movie that made me cry not because you feel sorry for the animals but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with yet we don't appreciate it one bit br br this movie should be shown obligatory in schools it is the most wonderful film you will ever see so go and see it who knows maybe it is the last time we might see our planet like this br br 10 10 but i would easily rate it more if it were possible,1
to be as honest as i possibly can the devil's plaything or veil of blood or vampire ecstasy or the curse of the black sisters or is a complete bore the movie has a good premise behind it  the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the body of a descendant through the aid and assistance of a group of women dressed in black  but the execution is horrible there are great long moments of screen time when literally nothing happens characters just stand around with nothing to do there's no mystery no suspense and no plot points to care about the acting is simply abysmal most of the acting involves a group of below average looking women dancing naked while staring at the camera they do this repeatedly and what little plot there is seems to be designed to get more of these less than attractive women naked so they can join in the dancing while it's not as bad or pointless as the dancing or the plot in something like orgy of the dead it comes close,0
new york city houses one man above all others the possibly immortal dr anton mordrid mordrid is the sworn protector of humanity using his magical powers to keep his brother and rival kabal chained up so that he may not enslave the human race well wouldn't you know it a prophesy comes true and kabal breaks free and begins collecting elements including platinum and uranium for his alchemy experiments with the help of a police woman named sam can mordrid defeat his evil brother dr mordrid comes to me courtesy of charles band in the full moon archive collection i had not heard of it which is a bit odd given that i'm a big fan of jeffrey combs mordrid and the film isn't that old but now it's mine and i can enjoy it again and again the film certainly is fun in the classic full moon style richard band provides the music which doesn't differ much from all his other scores and brian thompson plays the evil kabal we even have animated dinosaur bones what more do you want of course the cheese factor is high i felt much of the film was a rip off of the dr strange comics and the blue pantsuit was silly and plot holes are everywhere i could list at least five but why bother and why does the ancient symbol of mordrid and kabal look suspiciously like a hammer and sickle combs has never been a strong actor so he fits right in with the cheese these aren't complaints full moon fans have come to expect these things and devour them like crack laced grape nuts i'm guilty i loved this film br br if you're not a full moon fan or a jeffrey combs fan you may want to look elsewhere but if you like the early 1990s style of movie making and haircuts you'll eat this up stallone and schwarzenegger fans might like seeing brian thompson as a villain looking as goony as ever and not being able to enunciate english beyond a third grade level i did i wish there was a mordrid ii but the company that makes a sequel to practically everything is gingerdead man 3 really necessary passed on this one,1
it's hard to believe that this is a sequel to henry fool hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both movies while henry fool is refreshing witty comical fay grim is slow boring and doesn't go anywhere where has the wit gone i am baffled br br it is 10 years since i saw henry fool and many of its dialogs and scenes are still vivid in my memory fay grim is painful to watch this is no fault of the actors who are good parker posey or great jeff goldblum the blame lies entirely with the plot the dialog and even some of the filming low budget is no excuse a huge disappointment br br sorry i couldn't pay attention to the plot i was so bored so disappointed if you enjoyed this one you might not enjoy henry fool so much the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other there is no continuity in the characters' personalities it's all a fraud to entice fans of henry fool to watch the sequel br br i'm switching this off now henry in some sort of jail with a taliban,0
this is a dramatic film in the whole sense of the word it tells a tail that here in greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is sure it has some extremes but every now and then real life sorrow surpasses art it is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and the whole social structure build around them the film has a deeper understanding of greek ways of life stereotypes and social structure unlike most greek films that have a certain fast food mainstream audience this one does not target anyone in particular but while you watch it you feel that someone put the best possible words and pictures to describe your feelings i am not a big fan of traditional music either but i wouldn't like to hear anything else when it was played during the film br br if someone told me to say something against this film i'd define the following sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or somewhat cut i guess the editing had to cut it up to fit the 2hours and a bit for the theatres br br anyway i could write more and more to express my thought over this but i guess u have to see it and discuss it with a friend a must see,1
br br if you're at all interested in pirates pirate movies new orleans early 19th century american history or yul brynner see this film for yourself and make up your own mind about it don't be put off by various lacklustre reviews my reaction to it was that it is entertaining well acted for the most part has some very witty dialogue and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm appeal and legendary fascination of the privateer jean lafitte while not all the events in the film are historically accurate can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this i feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role lafitte played in new orleans' history and the love hate relationship between the respectable citizens of new orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city's favorite sons don't worry about what the film doesn't do but watch it for what it does do i e for its study of one of new orleans' and america's most intriguing historical figures,1
when i bought this dvd i though it seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in portuguese standards let's give it a chance i was totally wrong what a disappointing movie first it's not a comedy it's a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many portuguese soap operas second the plot is so boring and leads nowhere it has no structure it just flows like the wind in one or another direction the production is also bad the sound mixing is horrible because sometimes the voices are disconnected it made me remind some old portuguese movies from the 80's the acting should have been better too well to sum up it's not with films like this one that portuguese cinema will improve in fact it was one of the worst portuguese movies i have seen in the last years bad argument bad acting bad production i had no high hopes for this movie but it was much worse than i've ever imagined just forget about it,0

this man's navy is as other comments have indicated a rare and well filmed look at navy lighter than air lta activities the lta crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack and the filming at the various nas locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone however the first half of the movie is all about beery his relationship with his service pals and him meeting the tom drake character and his mother and getting drake's leg fixed only then does the second film start the second film is mostly ltas in action taking on a surfaced sub guys get killed and much damage is caused the look is fairly gritty and realistic i imagine then we shift to southeast asia did the navy have ltas there never mind this part is really wild with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle and the japs are shooting like mad shades of vietnam except the getaway is oh so leisurely this is a blimp we're talking about in the end a feel good wwii drama about a very unusual part of the war,1
two films are useful for scaring people to god this and 'event horizon' one has a significant and poignant message the other is as one dimensional as a religious movie can get too bad paul anderson went on to the accursed resident evil movies he really had something going br br thief in the night is hampered by many obvious independent film attributes acting storytelling dialog and persuasion and it's obvious what the film's intentions are from the start the christian film industry hasn't learned from the failures of this so we are stuck with the omega code left behind and the other tribulation movies their underlying element is that they are so concerned with selling their message get saved folks that everything else becomes second to whacking the audience over the head with a bible br br overall i can't believe i'm even writing this much about a movie this ineffective skip it entirely and go back to sam neil gouging out his eyeballs 1 out of 5,0
there is no such a thing as perfect murder lieutenant columbo knows that ken franklin who is the other half of the writing team of detective stories doesn't know that he kills his partner jim ferris who had plans on going solo now columbo steps into the picture and asks all sorts of questions from mr franklin and returns for one more question columbo murder by the book 1971 is directed by the young steven spielberg before his days of fame steven bochco wrote it columbo is a fantastic character with his shabby look it's hard to believe this man could solve any crime but he could each and every one of them peter falk is the one and only person in the world that could portray this character so no remakes please this part is a very good example of how columbo worked jack cassidy plays the murderer and martin milner plays the victim rosemary forsyth plays the victim's wife joanna ferris there's something endearing in the scenes between columbo and her how he makes the omelet and everything barbara colby plays lilly la sanka she actually met a tragic fate when she died after a homicide like she does here i've been a fan of columbo since childhood and i still enjoy watching them there was a break for many years that they weren't showing columbo stories at all but now he's back back for one more question,1
i still can't believe that wes craven was responsible for this piece of crap this movie is worse than deadly friend the plot is stupid the acting is mediocre and the film is deadly dull i don't know why wes craven hates his debut last house on the left an absolute masterpiece of the genre and likes probably this turkey don't get me wrong i really like some of his movies but it was a real torture sitting and watching this,0
forbidden planet is the best sf film from the golden age of sf cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder as soon as the spaceship lands the audience via the ships human crew travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure we meet the unforgetable robbie the mysterious dr morbuis his beautiful and innocent daughter altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet the krell who died out overnight or did they br br you can nitpick and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of claustraphobia i feel and bebe and louis barron s electronic music adds even more atmosphere br br i m shocked this film isn t in the top 250 imdb films,1
i truly enjoyed the movie however i did not realize that little richard had so many things going on in his life first of all i was not aware of lucille there is very little hardly any mention of females being intimately involved with little richard even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of females in a romantic way i wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned overall the movie was great i also did not like leon playing the part of little richard he is a good actor but i feel that the part of should have went to a different actor visually he did not remind me of little richard i also was totally unaware of the promiscuity that little richard was a part of from the movie he was pictured as a sexual addict in todays time he would be referred to counseling for his sexual addition he was a voyeur i don't want to ruin the movie for someone that has not seen the movie however there were several things about the movie that i feel should not have been a part of the final cut,1
filmatography excellent nice camera angles i don't remember seeing a movie of late with good close ups until this one could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft camera ny is pictured good i liked the upside down angles in particular a different touch br br music not impressive songs don't stick around in your mind even after watching the movie may be i expected same quality like anniyan a disappointment br br actors kamal needs to slowly pull away from hard core action sequences his age and belly really show up also he should avoid close romantic sequences going forward it was a very awkward to see a mature aged star still trying to play like a 20 heroes scenes love can be expressed at any age as we get older you still can express love nicely from a distance without touching a woman too much for example the love expressed by rajinikanth in chandrmukhi br br jyotika just appears for the namesake in the movie not sure why she accepted this well that is not my problem i guess br br others just have a small presence br br direction i expected gautham to excel or measure up to his other movie kakka kakka he disappointmented me it took a long time to release the movie due to various issues he slips in few scenes even abvious things got slipped from a famous director br br overall just a okay movie too much graphics definitely not for kids and adults who expect some kind of entertainment br br thx,0
living in the middle east in israel i was excited when i bought my ticket for syriana having seen the trailer and being a thriller lover i expected to see first of all a fast moving breath catching movie which wisely dips in global policy making and the relation between oil power and corruption from a fresh angle well i almost left the movie in the middle the pace was painfully slow almost all characters were stereotyped the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult but as steve rhodes wrote in his review in the end you don't care save your money save your time choose another movie br br robi chernitsky,0
i don't see how you can say that freddy's nightmares is cheesy and a rip off you obviously don't know good tv when you see it the episodes are packed with drama and blood freddy is creative in the way he kills people i love freddy's nightmares and i hope to get all 44 episodes on dvd the best episodes are saturday night special school daze and love stinks if you think this series sucked then you're entitled to your opinion but remember it's only your opinion and it means nothing freddy's nightmares will always be one of the best series ever and you'll come to accept that fact soon enough if you don't like it then don't watch it but don't deny it's brilliance,1
sistas in da hood looking for revenge and bling bling except da hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s i do not remember any westerns like this when i was growing up what would randolph scott say if he saw lil' kim he might say alright i have to admit that i tuned into this just to see her bare midriffs and low cut blouses are not the staple of the usual cowboy flick but these are the cowgirls and they are fine br br now don't go looking for any major story here and the usual stuff of ghetto crime drama are here in a different setting and when's the last time you heard john wayne call someone dawg and i don't remember the earp brothers hugging and kissing before they marched to the ok corral br br i watch this on bet so i missed the action that got it an r rating but i doubt if i will buy the dvd to see it unless i can be assured it was lil' kim in that action,0

there have been very few films i have not been able to sit through i made it through battle field earth no problem but this this is one of the single worst films ever to be made i understand whoopi goldberg tried to get of acting in it i do not blame her i would feel ashamed to have this on a resume i belive it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls flat on it's face well it happens here not to mention the sfx look for the dino with the control cables hanging out of it rear end halfway through the film i was still looking for a plot i never found one save yourself the trouble of renting this and save 90 minutes of your life,0
you talking' to me 1987 is a pretty bad movie starring some dude who i have never seen before or since starring as a guy from the neighborhood who tries to become an actor he has a heavy jones for taxi driver as tries to use that shtick to make it big when he learns the hard facts of life he does what everyone else does changes his image he goes from good fella to a surf's up dude over night his friend can't believe the change but he scores with faith ford and get's a cool paying gig can this young punk keep his street cred whilst making it big br br this is a real lame movie that tries too hard to incorporate too many things at once an interesting idea that falls apart due to poor execution who knows maybe somebody will pick up the ball and run because the film makers fumbled the ball this time br br don't waste your time with this movie unless you want to see a hot faith ford and a young bubba from forest gump br br xx,0
the true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way note that this change need not be positive or beneficial at the end br br by that measure enchanted april is a resounding success as a film in general it succeeds quite well excellent ensemble cast well developed characters you come to care about wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations in short the film is well enchanting although all the performances are first rate three must be mentioned josie lawrence jim broadbent and joan plowright it says something when miranda richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast most highly recommended particularly if you are a romantic at heart further deponent saith not,1
basically a dentist husband wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity the premise is interesting the acting is good and the music although sometimes abrupt and without direction is pretty cool br br the problem is the plot the husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show she has a minor role and then walks back in to give her something but sees her with another man the rest of the movie deals with his angst about this episode his visual hallucinations and a macho alter ego denis leary a former patient of his and his fear in confronting his wife lest he will have to do something about it i won't tell you the ending but let me say that the film goes nowhere and the ending is like a sputtering whimper the motivations of the characters are missing why is she cheating on him he's a dentist decent looking good father the film doesn't say who's she doing it with don't expect any answers on that either why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this who knows what purpose does all the kids vomiting serve where is this film going good performances by campbell scott and hope davis and denis leary as comic relief are completely wasted by this stilted nonsense which doesn't know if it wants to be american beauty or a family film a root canal is more interesting avoid it,0
i usually don't walk out of a movie but halfway thru i did this movie promised something different but i kept thinking haven't i seen that before spoiler alert back in 1 the spaceship crashes and lands on earth well all these years later with a super adult on board no less this thing still manages to burn up and crash what this advanced civilization can't seem to develop landing gear for an industry that's so liberal we get to see another woody allen movie no blacks please superman runs around saving people making sure he sticks to europe and the us don't go into darkie areas please maybe i could stomach this about 30 years ago but now now,0
after a quasi gothic all fruity music video the movie starts with cassidy the lead singer killing herself in a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll we don't live n that world the insipid band members decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence when i say clown i mean actual clown he tell them they're all going to die via cassidy's ghost the spirit possesses dora one of the band mates we couldn't care less as the characters are all boring vapid and extremely horribly acted written by adam hackbarth an incredibly apropos surname if there ever was one and directed by corbin timbrook who after the attendant and tower of blood has to know that he keeps making crap for a living this movie s a constant battle between the film's incompetence and the viewer's need to stay awake not enough blood to appease gore hounds nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs this movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone br br my grade f br br eye candy amanda carraway gets topless br br where i saw it starz on demand,0
this is just a bad movie with what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better it almost were with the heroine beautiful almost like salma hayek hero fighting almost like jackie chan battles and duels almost like in crouching tiger music almost like in say conan etc almost but in the end it's just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it maybe apart of john rhys davies flying in duel like those warriors in hero or before mentioned crouching tiger i am really ashamed of poor old john he is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better so as you so if you still have a chance just watch something else,0
i recently may 2008 discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a dvd although i've seen a great deal of high quality movies since then late 70's i was 10 in 1978 this three episode low budget thing still stands strong br br what's fun is that i now watched it with my 10 year old daughter and she experiences just the same as i remember from back then the creepy music she had to hold my hand even though she's been raised with watching lotr and resident evil the ever changing theories of who the culprit actually is and also complaining about the theatrical voices from an era before norway discovered the difference between stage acting and movie acting br br this is the one and only good science fiction movie or series ever made in norway and it's still worth watching,1
with the exception of family this new season is worse than season one i can't imagine what they are thinking as a fan of horror can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem but this series gets worse with each outing i can't imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day toiling to churn out such crap story is that too much to ask for character how can we give damn about the fate of anyone in these stories if we are not engaged who cares if they get carved up or whatever almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or reason why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting even dante's effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion ironically the production values and performances tend to be up to speed while the content is utter crap i have great hopes for exec producer's garris's valarie under the stairs but we shall see,0
this amusing bugs bunny cartoon sees the return of the still unnamed marvin the martian and his sidekick k 9 the green dog br br this time instead of trying to destroy the earth marvin is on a mission to land capture an earth creature and take it back to mars of course the creature he picks is bugs bunny at first bugs thinks marvin and k 9 are trick or treating but realises this can't be right when marvin drastically enlarges bug's rabbit hole with a ray gun bugs tries to trick his way out of the situation in a couple of ways including persuading marvin that k 9 is planning a mutiny eventually he is captured using an acme strait jacket ejecting bazooka amazingly for an acme product it works as advertised and bug's is forced to use his wits to get k 9 to release him the tables are soon turned and the two disgruntled martians are trussed up and bugs is trying to fly their saucer back to earth br br i really enjoyed this although the ending is a little weak compared to the rest of the story marvin's voice has changed slightly here and he gets visible emotional when he is angry but this didn't make me like him or the cartoon any less,1
this was a fairly creepy movie i found the music to be effective for this the photographs mario took of the village were also unnerving however i had three problems with this film one is that the lighting was very dark so some of the time it was hard to tell what was going on but this may have just been my copy the second is that the very beginning is not explained very well and i'm still not sure what was going on there the third problem is that i didn't understand the ending but apparently some people do of course there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things and the male lead is very 70s all in all watchable but not even close to being a favorite,0
brief summary this movie demeans everyone it touches that means you br br first off let me say i'm not a purist and this might have been funny for a few minutes the impersonations are not bad but overall it's just dull and excruciatingly not funny a few simple jokes are repeated over and over again br br it's clear that this movies only exists to squeeze the last few dollars out of the now trademarked laurel and hardy the producers cannot have any real regard for their place in film history or their talents this is what offended me the most br br of course my daughter liked it so i'm also a failure as a parent,0
i hated this crap every friday as part of tgif it was on and consistently sucked big time with stupidity each and every week if you want to see something funny go watch no on would tell starring candice cameron and fred savage it really is hilarious shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible tv show this show really makes me sick i hate those kids and bob saget needs to go jump off a bridge for ever making this crapfest i've seen funner stuff everywhere else but here i ahet writing 10 lines watch 'full house' to see the least humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment,0
i wouldn't call it awful but nothing at all shines in this movie and it is encumbered with some seriously unbelievable basic plot development it starts out well but once the main hit is done it devolves into a long subplot around a young girl which is not compelling and some action scenes which are theatre of the absurd unrealistic for example there is a prolonged shootout at the airport in which the lighting is all stroboscopic no explanation for that how credible is it that a airport storage area is going to have lights that flash on and off confusingly and just enough to let snipes do his incredible escape schtick this is one of far too few action scenes punctuated by pointlessly drawn out set ups that just fails to draw one into suspending belief br br in addition the whole premise seems to be that the united states cia team can shoot the place up but get away with it by saying national security to the brits this gimmick relies on a stereotype that is to far afield from reality to be satisfying br br there are a lot better action movies out there better formulated better executed this one is entertaining at times but there is just not enough meat on the bone and after a while it becomes downright boring something that should never happen in a good action movie,0
i'm sorry i had high hopes for this movie unfortunately it was too long too thin and too weak to hold my attention when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream i felt cheated surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper something more meaningful br br so don't buy a large drink or you'll be running to the rest room my kids didn't enjoy it either ah well,0
originally i rented this film for my daughter since she is keen on soccer and i was not disappointed that way except the plot interfered with the soccer scenes as a dad i suppose i was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbianism but i have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to children nowadays as uncomfortable as i feel with the topic in a way this emotion was a segue right into the main premise of the film that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices this dilemma is introduced by a young british born teen girl jasminder jess of east indian heritage who dreams of playing professional soccer the pending marriage of her older sister in a traditional hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities for her to explore in a nice way her hopes and fears for her future br br the multi cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore jess's frustration with her parents expectations for her again no different in substance than most child parent relationships br br in summary the soccer scenes are great lots to learn in slowmo and while i didn't need the storyline something was needed to keep the movie going,1
heads hands and feet a band from the past just like strange fruit a triple whammy there those who have professed not to like this film are either heartless or under 40 and have had no experience of the real thing sad for them this is an achingly well observed little picture that is an excellent way of passing an hour or two and will probably not even fade much on the second showing stephen rae timothy spall as the fat drummer in many ways quite the most delightful figure of all and bill nighy a new name for me as the neurotic vocalist and front man all turn in super performances and juliet aubrey has lovely doe eyes to go with some sharp acting as karen who tries to hold the band together as they spectacularly self destruct br br the syd barrett brian wilson echoes are loud and clear mott the hoople rear up before one in all their inflated ridiculousness and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute don't compare this with spinal tap or the rutles or the full monty it's unfair on all of them the nearest comparison is the commitments and that's no bad thing and any film that can conjure up memories of blodwyn pig a band i do not remember ever seeing but the name lives on well it shows somebody in the team knew what they were on about br br a small delight and thanks for the memory br br oh and i've got another one stiff little fingers a a and what about steeleye span spooky tooth ten inch nails anyone you have to see the movie or have been on the road,1
at first sight this movie doesn't look like a particular great one after all a bette davis movies with only 166 votes on imdb and a rating of 6 5 must be a rather bad one but the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surprise br br you would at first expect that this is a normal average typical '30's movie with a formulaic love story but the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story which also helps to make this movie a very pleasant one to watch br br the story is carried by its two main characters played by bette davis and george brent their helped by a cast of mostly amusing characters but the movie mainly involves just around them two their character are involved in a most unusual and clever written love story that work humorous as well it makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch that is perfectly entertaining br br the movie is quite short just over an hour long which means that the story doesn't waste any time on needless plot lines development and characters it makes the movie also rather fast paced which helps to make this movie a perfectly watchable one by todays standards as well it does perhaps makes the movie a bit of a simple one at times but this never goes at the expense of its entertainment or fun br br a delightful pleasant simple romantic comedy that deserves to be seen by more br br 8 10,1
the part where meg visits the mechanic and he says is the piston firing short implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée was hilarious i love meg ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie very lovable and very intelligent too her innocent indignant expressions have you wishing she was yours the hero handles the garage mechanic to physicist transformation well einstein had a romantic side to his psyche the puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well it's awfully underrated and deserves accolades and attempts at a revival it loses out one vote for including the highly improbable far fetched theory being bought by the us govt i don't see why it doesn't figure in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century great movie it has the presidential seal of approval on it,1
you'll know what i mean after you've seen red eye br br overall red eye was a better than expected thriller it gets off to a slow start and slowly builds but by the time it was over it's a thumper br br it's hard to exactly define what makes this thriller as thrilling as i found it except that simply put the director did a creditable job of pulling you into the action of what would otherwise have been a run of the mill plot i rather tended to forget i was watching a movie that says a lot br br other factors i think are the closeness of victim and bad guy and that over time you begin to really relate to the victim a scant 8 out of 10 more like a 7 5 but that's pretty good,1
this move was friggin hilarious funniest i've seen in a while akshay and john kick ass as always and the chicks are hot too the story is awesome lots of great jokes and whoever reviewed this before me is an idiot to him i say that u are not of indian background so u wouldn't understand the humor u moron don't rate movies u don't understand what did u watch the subtitle version where majority of jokes are lost in translation thats what i thought jackass br br akshay kumar is the best actor ever and proves once again his versatility he can do not only action but comedy as well and is excellent at it john has proved himself as well this is his first comedy role and he was also excellent at it,1
today i found they all laughed on vhs on sale in a rental it was a really old and very used vhs i had no information about this movie but i liked the references listed on its cover the names of peter bogdanovich audrey hepburn john ritter and specially dorothy stratten attracted me the price was very low and i decided to risk and buy it i searched imdb and the user rating of 6 0 was an excellent reference i looked in mick martin marsha porter video dvd guide 2003 and  wow  four stars so i decided that i could not waste more time and immediately see it indeed i have just finished watching they all laughed and i found it a very boring overrated movie the characters are badly developed and i spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story the plot is supposed to be funny private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing but i have not laughed along the whole story the coincidences in a huge city like new york are ridiculous ben gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man with the women falling for him as if her were a brad pitt antonio banderas or george clooney is quite ridiculous in the end the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the playboy centerfold and playmate of the year dorothy stratten murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie and whose life was showed in star 80 and death of a centerfold the dorothy stratten story the amazing beauty of the sexy patti hansen the future mrs keith richards the always wonderful even being fifty two years old audrey hepburn and the song amigo from roberto carlos although i do not like him roberto carlos has been the most popular brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as the king i will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions manly dorothy stratten my vote is four br br title brazil muito riso e muita alegria many laughs and lots of happiness,0
when this first came out 6 months after the tragedy i didn't want to see it i didn't want to open old wounds i regretted it now i have seen the movie thank god i did it shows you the bravery of all the fdny and nypd i salute you it offered me closure i can now move on with my life,1
connie hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at times br br that's it folks the sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or not br br these 70s sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness flared trousers big hair zapata moustaches etc this one isn't br br the script is bad the acting is bad the direction is bad and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally bad br br the title hinting at a sex comedy is grossly misleading br br i heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague,0
or an audience a quick recap br br so you've got this doctor who's been experimenting with stolen body parts for some vague reason he wants to perfect transplants but feels he needs to do this in his basement wtf and then suddenly unfortunately and conveniently his fiancé gets her head cut off in a traffic accident that he's responsible for agonized with grief he preserves her head in a lasagna pan or is it strudel and pumps it full of adreno serum sic to keep it alive and then she awakes talking her head off so to speak even though her neck was obviously severed at the vocal cords and she has no lungs so she couldn't speak even if she had 'em seems the ungrateful b tch doesn't appreciate all that her fiancé has done for her just like a woman br br then his grief turns to horniness as he sees the possibility of grafting his beloved's head onto the body of the first sleazy bimbo he can pick up off the street meanwhile the doctor's assistant a sort of dime store igor gets into philosophical arguments with the head who has struck up a telekinetic friendship with the monster in the closet every mad scientist has one eventually the screenwriter realizes that he can't keep inflicting his misogyny and fear of intimacy issues on the audience ad infinitum so he kills everybody then presumably goes to the bank to cash the check before the movie's financial backers have a chance to stop payment on it br br have i mentioned that i think this is a bad movie br br someone should tell turner classic movies to stop showing that edited version without the gory stuff the sight of the assistant with his arm ripped off pirouetting around the house without leaving much blood anywhere is just too precious,0
this is a great film the first time i saw it i thought it was absorbing from start to finish and i still do now i may not have seen the play but even if i had it wouldn't stop me thinking that the film is just as good,1
carlos mencia was excellent this is hour special he was working hard to show everybody he was the real deal i know people have said he's stolen material in this special but that is not true carlos brings comedy up front the way he wants it not how anyone else wants it that is why he is so good people say he's not funny because he says dee dee dee too much and they still haven't realized thats part of his act and they don't want it that way but he brings it like that anyway and succeeds in making people laugh for all the haters out there here is a message carlos is here to stay you have no point in trying to bring him down,1
i can't believe how awful this movie turned out to be i feel magnanimous even referring to it as a movie the acting was flat the editing was terrible and the plot leaves many major questions unanswered the premise was ok if unoriginal a small group of aliens is living in the us and trying to slowly take over humanity but it goes rapidly downhill from there how could they convince a human to accept an alien as his wife in order to make they alien human hybrid they require they show a larval alien but never show what it does they have a plastic surgeon that can produce perfect looking skin on an industrial scale they throw in the obligatory huge alien monster with teeth the ending was almost too painful to watch i suppose that i'm mostly disappointed that bruce boxlietner would have anything to do with this how could he say to the huge alien monster with teeth get away from him you son of a b tch with a straight face it's a long fall from his babylon 5 days avoid this at all costs,0
ok a slasher movie a very very stupid slasher movie br br we got your stereotypical teenagers in a house thing going we got a fbi agent that's seen dirty harry one time too many so what's the secret punks we got about 4 different little camera shots and scene that make no sense at all hey man i'm fixing the sprinklers that guy was my favorite part of the movie suddenly there's a preacher tied up on a couch watching home movies he gets killed br br they follow the killer into the middle of nowhere with no cops suddenly she's in a church wearing a wedding dress i swear this is the stupidest slasher movie i've ever seen,0
i watch this movie all the time i've watched it with family ages 3 to 87 and everyone in between they all loved it it really shows the true scenes a dog has and the love and loyalty you get from a pet just beautiful br br it's great for thoes who love comedy movies the tear jerker movies or even just pets br br the music is wonderful the animals spectacular the scenes truly thought out and the characters perfect what i liked about the characters is the true and nicely mixed personalities shadow the oldest a golden retriever he's the wise one filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog chance the american bulldog puppy is basically a puppy with a witty side the comical character and sassy the hymilayan cat she's the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for their owner the real girly one,1
this has just been broadcast on bbc and i am absolutely delighted to have seen it as the credits rolled the cast alone made certain that i would give it a go after just five minutes i was completely immersed in this beautiful film br br yes it was formulaic and predictable but that somehow added to it's charm the flashbacks to the forties were wonderfully placed and captured a feeling equalled in few productions br br a real feel good film punctuated throughout with outstanding music when it's released i'll buy it,1
wow uhm well wow i guess i'll start with the plot a betrothed woman lucy arrives at the family home of her would be husband mathurin in france where they are awaiting the arrival of the bishop or cardinal or someone in the catholic church to marry them to satisfy a will while waiting young lucy learns about a legend of a beast who roamed the grounds centuries before in bed that night she begins fantasizing about the beast and his rape turned consensual tryst with the former lady of the house that's where it gets interesting the plot is really pretty thin and it seems to drag on for quite a while in the middle of the flick but the filmmaker rewards those who stick it out with a shocking and hilarious finale br br this movie isn't for everyone if you're looking for great cinema look elsewhere if you're looking for a far out movie about bestiality that almost casts a sympathetic glance over the subject this movie is for you if you have a weak stomach don't be afraid of this one outside of some horse on horse action at the beginning the 'deeds' are pretty cartoonish imo,1
i saw this at a screening last night too i was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what i expected not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusion br br i won't bother rehashing the plot too much because i think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better but i will say that adam sandler's performance was really refreshing and real he was funny and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies don cheadle was believable as always br br this movie isn't funny like borat or billy madison but it has a good pace about it i'd say 90 of the audience laughed for most of the film midway through the movie slows down to address the drama end of things and does a really nice job of tying it all together br br i also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up the whole black friend white friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves,1
man to man tries hard to be a good movie it has its heart at the right place it aspires to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate but there lies also some of the problems of this picture it strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged so it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic man to man doesn't let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head joseph fiennes exemplifies this in his role he does his best to look concerned genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that man to man is not worth watching but there are enough points to defend it it is entertaining has some humorous scenes and the show stealing kristin scott thomas of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like the elephant man david lynch but you'll be leaving the theatre satisfied it tries to grab your heart even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious and succeeds most of the time,0
this screwy comedy seems very forced indeed the actors try very hard to make a go of an essentially unfunny script and as a result it doesn't really go anywhere the idea of a woman finding out she was pregnant after getting a quickie divorce just isn't all that funny and then when cooper sneaks off with the baby because he doesn't want it put up for adoption just seems terribly unfunny and it's really pushing hard to turn this into a comedy it's really a shame too as the actors were more capable than the script and i found myself just bored by the whole mess considering that cooper made so many good comedies i recommend you see them instead,0
the good thing about this film is that it stands alone you don't have to have seen the original unfortunately this is also it's biggest drawback it would have been nice to have included a few of the original characters in the new story and seen how their lives had developed sinclair as in the original is excellent and provides the films best comic moments as he attempts to deal with awkward and embarrassing situations but the supporting cast is not as strong as in the original movie forsyth is to be congratulated on a brave attempt to move the character on and create an original sequel but the film is ultimately flawed and lacks the warmth of the original,1
radio was not a 24 hour 7days a week happening when i grew up in the 1930s england so children's hour was a treat for me when we had batteries and an accumulator to spare for the power the few programmes i heard therefore made a great impression on my young mind and the 3 that i recall still are toytown one about all the animals at the zoo and grey owl talking about the animals he knew which he called his brothers it was only in recently that i learnt that grey owl wasn't a genuine indian but the tribute paid by the sioux chief makes great sense to me a man becomes what he dreams would that we could all dream as world changing and beneficial as archie grey owl belaney would that a new grey owl could influence world leaders to clean up the environment,1
in the barbarian and the geisha john wayne plays townsend harris a real envoy from the united states who was responsible for truly opening up japan to international relations in the late 1850s before him commodore perry basically pushed into japan with gunboats and forced a treaty upon the japanese in 1853 harris who arrived just a bit later worked through the details and helped ensure compliance as many of the japanese felt no particular inclination to honor the first treaty all this is true and shown in the film according to some other sources i found the romance between harris and a japanese geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is much of the focus of this film hence the title br br my first reaction the first time i saw this movie was one of surprise john wayne as a diplomat when he's being diplomatic in most films he says please and thank you as he pummels people so seeing him playing a man who is not a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed very odd indeed in fact i can't think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role by the way i've seen photos of harris and wayne has practically no resemblance to him at all br br however despite the story taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the strange casting the film is still very watchable the color cinematography is nice the film shows some nice insights into japanese customs and culture and the acting isn't bad all in all a likable and watchable film despite it's odd casting br br ps read through the trivia for this film you find out a bit more about the real life characters as well as a supposed fight between wayne and the director john huston where wayne apparently knocked him out based on what i've read about huston and the way he got along with actors this is an incident i tend to believe and it's also a nice example of john wayne diplomacy,1
after watching revolt of the zombies starring future academy award winner dean jagger i was left with one burning question how was a society that created these ultimate warrior fighting machines ever defeated in the first place br br that's the question you'll be pondering if you take time to watch revolt of the zombies towards the end of world war i the french discover a cult from occupied cambodia where these undead creatures who cannot be stopped with bullets form a brigade of monks who go over the top and dislodge the hun br br this scares the living fecal matter out of everyone concerned so an international expedition is formed to find out destroy the secret of these zombies so no nation can get their hands on it and rule the world br br but we've got some dissent in those ranks first is snidely whiplash villain roy d'arcy who murders the buddhist monk who has the secret and second is dean jagger power is the ultimate aphrodisiac as we all know and he's determined to woo dorothy stone away from rival robert noland br br i think you've got some idea how this comes out especially since a race of zombies didn't conquer the world for one country dean jagger as he got the oscar for twelve o'clock high must have shuddered every time he thought about this film and the awful dialog he tried to give a spark of sincerity to br br moral of the story you might make an ultimate warrior with the zombie potion and the zombie chant but you can't make an ultimate love slave,0

while some performances were good victoria rowell adrienne barbeau and the two italian girlfriends come to mind the story was lame and derivative the emphasis on the girlfriend's racial background was handled clumsily at best and the relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes not as real people i found myself wincing uncomfortably at many moments that were supposed to be funny i can hardly comprehend why the local paper here in sf said this was a good movie and wonder who posted the glowing review here on imdb very disappointed in this movie and mad i actually went to a theatre to see it based on the faulty connection to garden state which is a far funnier more inventive and touching movie than this one i must especially mention the emotional climax in the church which was so wooden and by the numbers that i nearly left and some in the audience actually did that was followed by a silly climax at the graveyard which i saw coming 10 minutes before it happened i really don't like being misled to spend my money so uselessly,0

dangerous offender is the story of a seemingly anti social girl and how she got that way it's based on a true story and though i was irritated by the one note depiction i e ever scowling of the title character and the hard to believe dedication of her lawyer i'm forced to accept that life does imitate art and that there are people out there like that br br the movie succeeds for me because although there's little softening of the title character's demeanour until almost the end one is gradually moved to sympathy for her as the movie shows how she got to her present state which proves to be self destructive rather than anti social br br truly a moving movie which will bring a lump to your throat when you think on it which will be often br br despite its many flaws including that it's hard to watch sometimes because of bodily functions and suicide attempts this is another production that i'm proud to call canadian,1
for all of the hype about this film i kept an open mind as to what i would ultimately think and although a bit slow at times the first 90 of the movie is quite good with more than a few old time scares that make one jumpy and unsettled i actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes where dark remains fails however is in its climax the ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be miles apart from its body the storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and the answer i was seeking most what really happened to emma was not elucidated upon the rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best and in the end i felt very cheated what could have been a superb horror film was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending,0

let me first state that i enjoy watching bad movies it's funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones this film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way this vehicle for sam mraovich's delusional ego doesn't just border on talentless ineptitude it has redefined the very meaning of the words this should forever be the barometer for bad movies sort of the mendoza line for film mr mraovich writes directs and stars as blunt object arthur sailes battling scorned wives and the christian forces of evil as he and his partner ben dead behind the eyes sheets struggle for marital equality as a libertarian i believe gays should have a right to get married ben arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes the portrayal of all things christian are so ugly and ham fisted trademark mraovich that you can't possibly take any of them seriously arthur's brother victor the bible toting jesus freak is so horribly over the top evil effeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role that's because sam multitasking mraovich was also casting director the worst of it all is sam mraovich himself when you think leading man do the words pasty balding and chubby come to mind sam also delivers lines like domino's pizza cold and usually wrong the final tally you suck at writing directing acting and casting that's the ed wood quadruple crown congratulations you horrible little man,0
'holes' was a great movie disney made the right choice every person who i have talked to about it said they loved it everyone casted was fit for the part they had and shia labeouf really has a future with acting sigourney weaver was perfect for the warden she was exactly how i imagined her everyone who hasn't seen it i recommend it and i guarantee you will 'dig it',1
this film is just a kids against evil genre thunderbirds is just the hook to get people to see it but are almost incidental in use the fact that the action takes place on tracy island is just a ploy to pull in the public it was interesting to note what the film makers view of future london will be and how the world all fits together br br the best part of this film are some of the lines delivered by lady penelope which are highly comical these provided some light relief for those expecting a rerun of the tv series br br having said that it passes 90 or so minutes in a 'fun' way and so may just be worth watching,0
being the beatlemaniac that i am i approached two of us with a combination of fear and fascination having seen 'in his life the john lennon story' i was quite concerned that two of us will turn out no better the fact that aidan quinn and jared harris look absolutely nothing like john lennon and paul mccartney  even with some make up and proper hairdos  didn't help one bit br br but i was more than a bit pleasantly surprised it's probably thanks to the involvement of michael lindsay hogg who directed let it be in 1970 and consequently probably knew john and paul quite well that the characters and the dialogue came across as convincing as they did the writing credit for two of us is given to a man named mark stanfield of whom i know absolutely nothing i feel confident that director lindsay hogg had more than a bit to do with the script two of us is not a biography of the beatles it has very little plot in fact and takes place all in one day in new york city what it does is imagine a meeting between john and paul in 1976 while john lived in new york that meeting is entirely fictitious of course  though it can't truly be disproved that such a meeting actually took place but through that imagined conversation it gives us a glimpse into the personalities of these two great musicians  their intelligence their sense of humor their different reaction to stardom and most of all their relationship what made them such a great team and what broke them up br br since it's a talk movie nothing much except for dialogue between two characters for an hour and a half it's likely to bore all but true fans of the beatles but it's a fantastic piece of writing and storytelling and is both informative and touching for those interested in these two musical giants very quickly you'll get over the shock of how different the actors look from their counterparts and feel like john and paul had come to life  so intimate and convincing is the script and so committed are the actors two of us gives you priceless insight into the lives of two geniuses and a tale that is both sad and funny most certainly recommended,1
when a small glob of space age silly putty lands on earth it soon begins consuming earthlings and putting on weight the only part of this senseless drivel that i enjoyed was all the cool classic cars this dog had so many holes it could be sliced and sold for swiss cheese this thing actually made 20 million bucks and mcqueen's salary was 3k all were vastly overpaid the 'monster' looked a lot like a large beanbag and the 'teens' looked as though they could have children approaching their teen age years and those blasts from the shotgun sounded like a pellet rifle with a sound suppressor the ending was pitifully trite obviously the producers were leaving the door open for a sequel and there were many thumbs down,0
i got this dvd well over 2 years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday i don't know why it took me so long as i do like the inspector gadget show and even the new gadget and the gadgetinis while it may have a bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie there are some old things missing that bog this gadget right down the toilet br br first of all the classic inspector gadget theme song and music is completely absent the composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but it's still just no good enough the gadget mobile is now a talking car not a car that can turn into a van plus it looks a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool penny no longer has her computer book and she and brain hardly make an appearance at all br br the plot is non existent there's something about a transformation formula and doctor claw using for some never revealed evil but that's all i got what the deal was with the short giant italian guy i will never know it had nothing to do with anything br br and if the title is anything to go by his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever and he stays on the force so why it's called 'last case' is a mystery also br br i wasn't impressed at all this is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on dvd but don't let that prompt you into buying whatever inspector gadget dvds you can i sold this mere seconds after finally watching it no kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it,0
contrary to its title this film offers no spice and thus audience is subjected to a tasteless dish all humor appears forced theatrical mechanical staged reminiscent of those pakistani plays available on video including even the mannerisms everybody is screaming shouting and doing odd things for no reason the premise looks interesting as it is a straight lift from hollywood's 'boeing boeing john abraham who is so natural in almost all his films is a complete misfit here if we keep morality factor aside even then the bizarre events looks trite akshay kumar and paresh rawal two experienced stalwarts try hard to lift the film by being natural but in vain at least the characters of three girls should be made contrasting in order to bring some interesting elements but sadly here too all of them appears those brainless buxomed bimbettes 3bs who talk behave and even scream in quite similar fashion the major hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls at his same home pretending that they will never get to know about each other just to do some sex what else the same could be done in hundreds of other ways therefore so much dramabaazi for no reason is not something audience will digest easily but surely great flesh show and tempting promos always gives such films a great initial now for those who call it a situational comedy i call it a pathetic taste sense of humor of such cinema going audience is surely gone corrupted and demented to the extent that they are connecting to a sadistic weird and maddening type of humor where it is not the characters that they laugh at but rather at themselves and at their own frustrations that look how senseless we have become that in order to laugh we have to bear with such things,0
this gets a two because i liked it as a kid but it became so redundant that i just started to hate it i can't give this a descriptive review because it would be restating one thing after the other i probably wouldn't say anything that everyone else didn't say already br br the only other thing about this show is that it's pretty nasty with the kid with the boil to that twisted babysitter to the stupidity that runs around and about in it i have a cousin that loves this show and he's the strangest and dumbest person i have met this show should be pulled from the air it's always the same thing over and over they need to put better shows on nick i'm getting really really tired of stuff like this,0
an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe they've taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that they've taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but it's simply bizarre by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwater dull script i suppose there weren't enough naked people in the factual version it's hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist's life we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they'd favored the rest of the film with same brevity,0
i saw the 10p m showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special although i did not leave the theater wanting my time back as i don't actually pay for movies anymore i didn't really find any redeeming qualities br br there were a few lines and such that made me chuckle but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger in mind more than age as this film is rated r male audience the fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well i know you all want to hear samuel l say his infamous line but let's be honest it's a whole lot of hype for very little pay off the only truly horrible part of the film was the cg which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen br br now i am a reasonable man i knew going into the theater that i wasn't going to be seeing casablanka and i am at least thankful that this film is an original albiet inane idea and not some re make or franchise spin off however to be honest if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months,0
i was prepared to laugh throughout this movie like a mystery science theater experiment but it was just boring it appears that the producers had many biker enthusiast friends and from there casually decided to make a movie br br it is frequently unwatchable lots of footage of the bikers riding on a dirt road with the same music played repeatedly unfortunately renee harmon is barely in the movie harmon probably would have livened things up perhaps she had other commitments the day this was filmed br br of course the bikers terrorize a small town fights murder a cowardly cop a goofy mechanic etc one of the bikers always wears a football helmet a weak attempt to distinguish him from all the other outlaws br br the script has nothing to offer one scene features a biker assaulting a woman yelling in the lady's face you're all the same you're all the same we come back to the scene a minute later and he again declares you're all the same couldn't the writer think of something more creative to say br br at the end the good guys have killed the bad guys we also learn that the wedding between middle aged mechanic joe and young susie has been canceled susie is going away to college and we abruptly learn that joe's wedding is still on but with a different bride end,0
even though there's a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from this 'succubus' is often named as the best jess franco film heck even the legendary filmmaker fritz lang counts 'succubus' among his personal favorites so maybe it's me but i thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie the opening is great though and shows janine reynaud performing an sm act on stage it's all downhill from here unfortunately reynaud's character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score this could have been his greatest film indeed if it wasn't for the lame and uninteresting story it's supposed to be psychedelic but i'd say sophomoric is a better term to describe what's shown here half of the time you don't have a clue what's going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to last ages this most certainly isn't franco's best film according to me i wouldn't even recommend it to die hard exploitation fans if you're looking for more superior jess franco film try to get your hands on 'las vampiras' 'the awful dr orloff' or 'female vampire',0
one of the better kung fu movies but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews the movie starts out well enough with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier which is rarer than you'd think for this era and make the non fight dialogue sequences passable for a kung fu movie this is a great compliment unlike other chinese action movies which were always period pieces or in the wake of jackie chan's police story i cop dramas pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china unfortunately in the latter 1 3 of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary br br the action is overall good featuring a duel between sammo and 1 2 of the shaw brothers' only 2 stars kar leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li's bad guy there's only 20 minutes of combat here which is standard but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other but there are smooth edits and then there's this it really takes away from the fights when it's this obvious the footage was messed with br br that said if you like kung fu movies my opinion here won't dissuade you and if you don't you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this,1
i can not believe i wasted my money to rent this movie i thought it was a porn flick when it started and it never got any better the acting the music drowning out the actors horrible save your money you have to read the movie all the way through b c they knew the music would drowned out the speaking lines i never got the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being butchered what did that have to do with the real btk killer i understand why there were no famous actors actresses in this movie the script would have turned me away within the first page of reading you would be better off watching paint dry,0
when i look back on my college days at ohio university there will always be one event in which i will remember with fond memories channel 23 is ou's local access channel and until the last few years pretty much played anything they were sent this included many diy movies ranging from a guy microwaving marshmallow peeps and then scanning pictures of them online to a version of macbeth starring 8th graders who had apparently just learned how to make squibs br br however the king in my opinion of the channel 23 lineup was midnight skater the first time i watched it was around 2am i should have been studying or sleeping or watching regular tv but no all that is for pussies my roommate and i watched midnight skater and when it was complete i don't think either of us believed that any of the movie had just happened but sure enough it was on a few nights later and we had to come to grips that this movie did in fact exist br br i could go on and on about how awful it is but its the sort of awful that makes life worth living the plot is disjointed the acting terrible the everything soul scarring but by god if there are others watching with you its impossible not to have a good time watching it its sort of like the first time you hear guts by chuck pahalniuk you hear it you're disgusted and shaken but five minutes later all you want and desire is to make someone else experience the abject horror you just endured br br long story short midnight skater for all of its epic flaws makes for some very late night fun plus i desperately want the theme to midnight skater kudos to whoever wrote it and sang it sweet god i love that song,0

this movie does contradict the first one as far as the origins of the care bears and the care bear cousins goes i won't deny that however if you look at part ii as a separate film then it's a very good movie i remember watching this in the early 80's and fitting into its targeted demographic audience then and absolutely loving it much more than the first movie not that i didn't enjoy that one too it's just that this one seemed to have a little something extra to it sure it's darker than the first one too but perhaps maybe that's why it's so good and it's dark in deeper kind of subtle way too that kids may not fully understand but could still be a bit scared of because of the atmosphere it gives off and adults watching will surely get quicker as i have now watching this film again now in my mid twenties where you basically have a young girl making a deal with an evil spirit demon in exchange for something else get the picture but simply watching that as a child sure as i said it may have been a little scary but nothing traumatizing in fact if anything it gave me another fantasy game i could play when i was that age i can't tell you the number of times i used to pretend dark heart wanted to imprison me have me help him capture the care bears tried to make me turn over to his dark side and other things like that etc so this movie was also good for my imagination and it's also got great emotional depth to it too i used to watch it at least once a week br br also hadley kay was the perfect choice for the voice of dark heart i always thought so and i always will br br now it's just too bad that they never made a soundtrack available sometimes i just want to hear growing up without watching the movie as good as it is br br what good is love and caring if it can't save her,1
this film is a twisted nonsense of a movie set in japan about a dysfunctional family who end up with a strange violent guest who just sits back and watches the 4 members of the family at their worst nothing is sacred in this movie with sex drugs and violence stretched to such a limit i'm surprised it got past the censors br br overall i think it will appeal only to those whom we shouldn't be encouraging rather than any supposed underlying message coming out for the rest of us to consider a film that panders to the worst element in society and is in anyway utter gash a disappointment from a man who made the sublime dead or alive and audition movies,0

spoiler warning br br first of all i rated this movie 2 out of 10 br br the idea is good but there are too many stupid errors in the movie failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been first of all she never fights alone after an initial very strange doubt from her mother which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie the rape victim is not alone br br she is also unbelievably naive always falling into the crew's strange traps br br her friends are unbelievably nasty br br the thing that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon ethan is very much the leader of the crew hey they even say so and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk but when ethan changes his opinion he just doesn't manage to convince even one single person in the crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong everyone just simply hates him why the movie provides no explanation how did he ever become the leader br br a funny note is that my girlfriend thought i was watching beverly hills when she came in two actors from the same successful tv series a cheap way to get viewers,0

salvage is the worst so called horror film i've ever seen there is nothing remotely horrific about it it doesn't deserve to be in a genre so fine first of all i don't see how so many people can think this piece of crap such a great movie if i wrote something as boring and utterly ridiculous as this i would be laughed at and too embarrassed to subject others to the stupidity of it second the acting is terrible and the lead actress is excruciatingly ugly third the story sucks its been used before and the excuse that its a cheap movie is no excuse read the summery on the back of the case it reveals the whole story i do not recommend that you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste on something that will leave you regretting that you watched it i feel really bad for those crooks and the irony of their name all hail anthony perkins,0
stephen king was raised on flicks like this flicks not films br br movies like this and 'jeepers creepers' are throwbacks to the good 'ol day drive in horror flicks they are meant to be fun cheaply made and hopefully a few good scares br br anyone looking for a theory on the human condition should pass on this creature feature because that's all this is all it ever will be br br stop trashing what has already deemed itself as trash good fun trash br br if you enjoyed this i recommend 'jeepers creepers' 'jeepers creepers 2' '30 days of night' 'scarecrows' '88 'they live' 'planet terror' 'death proof' and 'halloween iii season of the witch',1
a lot of people hated this movie but that i blame on two facts 1 they want it to be too much like the first couple of american pie movies and 2 they are trying to take it too seriously br br this one i found was the best one out of all six and i absolutely love dwight the plot is predictable i'll say that but then what teen comedy isn't road trip dirty deeds etc etc they are all incredibly predictable but still goddamn funny i say this is worth watching i love it i find it hilarious just don't watch it while comparing it to the first ones because it's nothing alike br br after watching naked mile and this one it became obvious that all the american pie movies were about and only about the stiflers which is fine by me br br watch enjoy love xd,1
it breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be its very underrated people forgot what movies are really about nowadays they only think about bum bum movies which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends like transformers movies which are oriented with hyper mega high budget like 300mln or even higher on special effects only and which are dumb movies without storyline its the kind of a movie what i despite most of course it is fun watching greatly made cgis but we do not gain anything essential from that kind of movies br br i honestly think that performance was excellent especially busy philipps alongside with erika christensen and victor garber whom i respect made this movie an oscar worth emotional performance by busy philipps was astonishing its such a shame we wont see oscar in her hands which she deserves,1
i have seen a lot of bad films most of the time i can enjoy a crappy horror film for what it is but this really takes badness to new extremes br br it is bland the plot for what it is never really goes anywhere and takes its time over it there are no shocks no horror no suspense just a load of guys rubbing themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick finish br br a blight on the crappy horror genre avoid at all costs br br,0
christ oh christ one watches stunned incredulous and possibly deranged as this tawdry exercise in mirthless smut unfolds with all the wit and dexterity of a palsied galapagos tortoise can such things be does this movie actually exist or was i the unwitting guinea pig of some shadowy international drugs company sipping my coffee unaware that it had been spiked with a dangerous hallucinogen i've seen a lot of films and a lot of bad films but nothing prepared me for this by the end of it i was a gibbering snivelling wreck tearing at the carpet with my teeth like a dog clawing at the walls howling till my lungs were sore i pleaded desperately frenziedly for mercy to whom this appeal was made i don't know and longed with burning desire for the soothing balm of ozu yasujiro sweet weeping jesus the memories sometimes they come back to me when i'm at my most vulnerable when i'm least able to handle them i shudder i break down in tears i bite my fingernails till my hands are slathered with blood but i can't quite banish the awful flashbacks from my mind i'm haunted i'm damaged i'm a shell of a man br br the other user comments here suggest that i am not alone in having undergone this terrifying experience which can only mean one of two things a the film does in fact exist or b i am but one victim among legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions what is quite mind boggling is that some people seem to have enjoyed their ordeal or at least have not been left traumatised by it perhaps they're part of the operation god damn them the maniacs god damn them all to hell,0
taiwanese director ang lee whose previous films include 'sense and sensibility' and 'the ice storm' turned to the american civil war for his latest feature based on a novel by daniel woodrell it follows the exploits of a group of southern guerrillas known as bushwhackers as they fight their northern equivalents the jayhawkers in the backwater of missouri br br as one might expect there is plenty of visceral action but the focus is on the tension that the war put on the young men who fought it many of whom were fighting against their former neighbours and even family jake roedel tobey maguire is such a man or rather boy as he is only seventeen when the war reaches missouri he is the son of a german immigrant but instead of following his countrymen and becoming a unionist he joins his lifelong friend jack bull chiles skeet ulrich and rides with the bushwhackers despite a lack of acceptance because of his ancestry and an unwillingness to participate in the murder of unarmed union men he remains loyal to the cause so does his friend daniel holt jeffrey wright a black slave freed by another bushwhacker and so fighting for the south br br lee handles the subject with aplomb never rushing the deep introspection that the plot demands in favour of action and this lends the film a sense of the reality of war long periods of boredom and waiting interposed with occasional flashes of intensely terrifying fighting the action is unglamorised and admirably candid recognising that both sides committed a great number of atrocities br br the performances are superb with maguire and wright both courageous and dignified up and coming irish actor jonathan rhys meyers is particularly chilling as a cold blooded killer while skeet ulrich is enjoyably suave and arrogant lee never flinches from the reality of war but his actors do an admirable job of showing the good that comes from it the growth of friendship the demonstration of courage and on a wider scale the emancipation of oppressed peoples ride with the devil is a beautiful and deeply compassionate film that regularly shocks but always moves the audience,1
a very addictive series i had not seen an exact combination among drama action suspense and sci fi never before i am impressed every chapter the screenplay is very intelligent i don't know how the creators invent all this amazing stories every character have a strange past troubles stormy relationships it gives to the show the human sense needed for creating intimate characters br br the most incredible is the fact that all the characters are related among them the numbers they have met before without knowing it and so on the others enigmatic security system and the darma initiative are elements that don't let us lose a chapter br br mr jj abrams what did you think to create this amazing story,1
dig i would say to anyone even if you don't like metallica to see 'some kind of monster' it is a spinal tap type documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world acting like mental kids during a breakdown of sorts it's fun and fascinating along the same lines comes dig a film about 'the dandy warhol's' and 'the brian jonestown massacre' two portland bands who start off a kind of music scene in there home town only for one of the bands to become huge and one to fall by the wayside into the musical history books right from the start the two bands pull in opposite directions just on their ability to make decisions whether good or bad filmed over seven years and at times painful to watch we see the dandy's meteoric rise to fame thanks to that vodaphone ad and the jonestown seminal fall from scene instigators to bickering wannabes as the bands become more disjointed the friendships are stretched tension tight and at several points snap into arguments and even on stage fights all of this is half funny and half tragic and believe it or not is perversely watch able like i said at the beginning you can watch the metallica film even if you have no interest in the band dig on the other hand is slightly different and is more enjoyable and a whole lot easier to watch if you have a passing interest in either band still a good film and more a testament to not be in a band than encouraging that as a career path dig is a mad ride on rock and roll's coat tails and a fine example of the pitfalls and pleasures of being or wanting to be famous,1
what begins as a fairly clever farce about a somewhat shady security monitoring company turns almost instantaneously into an uninteresting and completely inane murder mystery david arquette and the great stanley tucci try mightily to make this train wreck watchable but some things are just not humanly possible br br what for instance causes gale to turn suddenly from a sweet motherly figure into a drunken shrew at tommy's parents house why would heinrich although admittedly a sleezebag want to destroy the business to which he devotes his life by robbing and possibly murdering his customers why does the seemingly sensible tommy believe that heinrich could be a murderer based almost entirely on a dream and even if that were believable why wouldn't he go to the police and why didn't gale activate the alarm when she got home especially after scolding howie about it being off of course all of these events are necessary for the plot and i use the term very very loosely to unfold and it might be forgivable if it resulted in even the slightest bit of comedy but everything from howie's description of his date rape to the coroner's misidentification of gale to the final joke about gale and howie still being dead is more tasteless and pathetic than anything else br br i checked the box indicating that my comments contained spoilers but there's nothing more i or anyone else could do to spoil this thing that already stinks to high heaven,0
what can i say i ignored the reviews and went to see it myself damn the reviews were so right what a waste of money considering it's budget br br good thing i went to see kill bill after this one br br to see a really scary movie would be crossroads br br bottom line i like girl in gold boots better than this crap,0
fatty drives the bus is simply the funniest most original and entertaining piece of work i have ever had the pleasure of seeing br br this movie is by no means up to hollywood standards or even that of a straight to video movie fluff comedy starring terry hulk hogan in terms of camera work editing acting budget or anything else br br what this movie does have though is a very original and enjoyable story and it is obviously done by people who love making it and the enthusiasm of the all the cast and crew really break through all its budget and acting downfalls br br this movie proves that you don't need a huge budget or decent actors to make a great film all you need are some original ideas and some passion for what your doing br br simply the best movie ever i don't care how you get it rent it order it steal it download it just see this movie br br now i just hope they make a dvd version,1
this movie i don't know why they would take such an indellible character as pippi longstocking and cast the singularly charmless tami erin i will never know why they would spend money on art direction and some not all that bad special effects then not bother to edit it properly i will never know why the sets and costumes are sometimes in period and sometimes bizarrely not why they commissioned such bad songs why the script doesn't make any sense whatsoever not even on a silly children's film level what were they thinking nothing about this movie is quite as it should be every single part is dubbed and always poorly every sound effect is slightly wrong every edit is in the wrong place every performance is bad in some way it does manage to create an appropriate atmosphere despite all the problems but it never captures the magic that is astrid lindgren's creation,0
wow i loved the whole series and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly perhaps it waffled a bit in seasons 4 5 while remaining better than anything else on television but 6 and particularly 6b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons br br 6b started with such a sombre mood and janice's always keen insight into the family angst that doom filled line about knowing tony's penchant for sitting and staring anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know tony melfi's discomfort over the psychiatric study and its references to the sociopath's self deluding sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series say with tony's panic attack over the ducks leaving his pool and resonates with phil's wave bye bye line to his grandchildren before the coup de grace of the final episode not to get into chase's dark humour br br i could go on and on but i'll just add that i thought the final show starting with the opening strains of vanilla fudge to supply the ironic foreshadow you keep me hangin' on to the terminal moments where tony fades back into complacency with his family in tow or blasts apart like aj's suv or phil's head were utterly utterly perfect the best tv ever br br pretty good in a dying medium pathologically supplying the jack off fantasies aj derides and then into which he promptly subsides a tip of the pork pie to mr chase,1
although this was obviously a low budget production the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing one of walken's few musical roles to date he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well watch for the cartwheel also starring jason connery a great children's story and very likable characters,1
no br br basically your watching something that doesn't make sense to not spoil the film for people who actually want to this take a look at the flick i will explain the story br br a normal everyday to day women is walking down a street then find's herself driving by in her own car she follows her and many events take place during that time that include her and her family br br i specifically made an account to comment on this film of how horribly written this was the acting was great the events were great but the story just brought it nowhere it could of been added to tremendously and be made into a worldwide epidemic i'm not sure what the writer was trying to accomplish by making this usually at the end of films most of your questions get answers but this film has you asking what just happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just passed for nothing br br spoiler starts br br they had this area between 2 dimensions ours and behind the glass that would come into our world and kill us it was not elaborated on all during the film and you never know how it was happening or why it was or when it happened nothing gets explained during the film the main character shouldn't of even been the main character at the end of the film the guy who finally figures it all out and runs away her sisters boyfriend should of been the main character but sadly the movie ends 20 seconds after br br i bought this movie for 10 threw it out right after don't waste your time i really hope nothing like this is made again,0
i am a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because i heard how interesting it was i can honestly say it was very interesting indeed the two lead actors are awesome the film isn't ever boring and the concept behind it though obviously inspired by the columbine killings and the home movies of the killers is really interesting there are some weaknesses such as the final 20 minutes which really detracts from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesn't make any sense at all the shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction but in cinema verite that is a given but i still think the movie is very well done and the director ben coccio deserves some credit,1
fraidy cat the 4th of these cartoons is a good one at least i like it so i'm surprised that this is getting mixed reviews br br this one is more of a macabre story than a funny one although it has its moments of comedy the atmosphere is dark and spooky suspense is another strong element here as for humor it's mostly dark humor br br in this short tom listens to a creepy radio show at night and is absolutely terrified because it is about ghosts something he believes while tom is scared to death jerry is watching everything and can't help but laugh the whole time in fact jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more with the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner he creates a big ghost br br tom lives the scariest experience of his whole life although jerry scares tom without a good reason the way the story is made ends up being funny plus once again there is no violence here because this is one of tom jerry's oldest cartoons however i don't get that joke of tom's 9 lives nearly sucked into the vacuum cleaner br br when tom finally finds out that it was all a jerry's scheme and that jerry made a fool out of him jerry is «caught with the hand in the cookie jar» he deserves to be discovered yet tom shows an incredible patience before reacting he angrily looks at jerry for about a minute the funny thing is that jerry invites tom to laugh with him and takes about half a minute to realize that tom is looking at him with a very serious face jerry tries to be funny but tom doesn't laugh br br overall this is a different peculiar and remarkable tom jerry experience,1
this movie is just plain terrible poor john savage had to stoop this low in order to be in another movie he stars as a rare type of vampire that is to help a lady that looks like a washed out and thrown in the streets hooker that is a dancer at a local strip club she acidently tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires as they get carried away making out on the floor of the dressing room savage is then assigned by a short leader of this rare vampire breed that looks like a cross between 80's punk rock and one of the olsen twins with purple hair this movie just gets all to crazy with savage rapping and dancing with a midget with a tattooed spider on his head also one of the rare he quotes the elephant man and jimmy durante and i just had to laugh this just gets rediculas and then the most gross special effects that they could come up with is corri throwing up her organs and pulling them out of her mouth and you can tell that that is all to fake her son doesn't know what to do with his moms new identity and becomes more of a pest than an object of serenity i enjoy a good vampire film believe me i do but i just hated this one even the photography stinks in and out blurs with the camera switching this way and that trying to make it look like the vampires move to fast for the camera to keep up and then the camera turns all to bright in the scene of savage chasing the son of corri around till he blinds himself avoid this one,0
this movie is a half documentary and it is pretty interesting br br this is a good movie based on the true story of how a bunch of norwegian saboturs managed to stop the heavy water production in rukjan norway and the deliverance of the rest of the heavy water to germany br br this movie isn't perfect and it could have been a bit better the best part of the movie is that some of the saboturs are played by themselves br br if you're interested in history of wwii and film this is a movie that's worth a look,1
no i've never seen any of the santa slasher series i e 'silent night deadly night ' the original 'black christmas' or this one 'christmas evil ' i've heard all about their reputation or mads mothers against deranged santas i thought i would rent this one as i've heard it pop up as a reference on a 'fat guys at the movies' segment br br mothers should be against this but not for the ooooohhhh killer santa but for the fact this movie was just plain crap boring long  even at only 92 minutes crap br br little boy sees santa arrive down a chimney in 1947 deliver presents eat some goodies and miraculously float up the chimney boy goes to bed but returns to living room to witness mommy and santa sort of getting it on apparently this messed up that kid for the rest of his life though the scene was about as steamy as when ralphie's dad got the leg lamp in 'a christmas story ' he was sooo disturbed he went to the attic and well cut his own hand br br fast forward to the future now it's 1980 and messed up boy works in a toy factory we get a whiff of him being a little off kilter and he stalks both kids and parents alike who's naughty who's nice blah blah it takes a good two thirds of the film to get him to finally snap  as if that's not foreshadowed from frame one no movie should take that long br br i will admit this movie had its tension building but only because i kept expecting him to do something anything to anyone when he finally does well punish who's naughty it's as graphic as a garbage pail kid card and i haven't mentioned the wtf ending i'm thinking it was a metaphor but in reality it's just as weird as the rest of the movie take the brother who's upset his sibling is killing and his solution isuh killing don't open this mess even on christmas eve or evil again i didn't watch the other santa slashers but this one sucked bad it built up suspense due to the nature of the movie and never once delivered a decent present,0

this series could very well be the best britcom ever and that is saying a great deal considering the competitors fawlty towers good neighbours to name just two br br what made butterflies so superior even to the best of the best is that it did not just exemplify great classic classy and intelligent comedy but it also expanded horizons reflecting flawlessly gently and at every detail the great social change that was occurring in britain at the time br br i remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it the lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself this was the first time i saw real people using cordless phones and the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in north america at the time then there were the decors shop fronts cars these people even the layabout sons with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor were sophisticated they were examples of the new europeans that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade 1980s br br of course the premise was strange and fantastic the idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary particularly to north americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things sure the situation was depicted in american movies and tv but not with the intensity of butterflies or the movie montenegro and if the premise was not surprising enough the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme a potential affair that was not really about sex or even romance butterflies dazzled many but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief at the time anyway br br butterflies turned out to be in so many ways prophetic it documented ahead of its time post modern ennui all pervasive lifestyle the notion of emotional infidelity and generational disconnect and male discontent portrayed perfectly by the strained father son relationships it is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come,1
a beautiful movie especially if you like horses wwii films and the austere hungarian plateau a story of courage compassion and loyalty that transcends generations the horsemanship is spectacular as well as the main characters' horse in his own training br br i will buy this movie and watch it again this is a family film and i recommend it highly a good ''family nite'' movie although there are some violent scenes it was the nazi occupation of hungary the native people were very interesting in the way they stood their ground even in the face of certain death from a nazi officer who had his own personal reasons for hunting down brady a hauntingly beautiful film,1
this is peter falk's film period br br i was 10 years old when this film came out i was already a film maven at the time of course neither my parents nor i saw this film when it came out but i was in love with the typeface of its ads the aura that this was an important film okay 34 years later i've finally seen the film having never seen any cassavetes directed film previously he's a hack overall zero sense of timing editing gena's performance reminds me too much of dustin hoffman's stint in rain man technically on par but entirely one note as tom cruise stole rain man falk takes the cake for this film br br i was annoyed with gena's performance really throughout it seemed better suited for awakenings blecch it's not all her fault she's a basket case from first scene to last we never find out why but falk's character seems real is performed wonderfully by falk as a seriously flawed man br br shave off at least an hour an editor needed and this would have been an arresting portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple cro magnon man coming to grips with a wife who doesn't work yet cannot deal with her three kids her husband's long hours of work br br i'd rather remember cassavetes for the dirty dozen or rosemary's baby he would have been a better director had he snipped his own tendency for excess as he amply demonstrates with this film br br bob,0
charming in every way this film is perfect if you're in the mood to feel good if you love jazz music it is a must see if you enjoy seeing loveable characters that make you smile can bring a tear to your eye and swing like there's no tomorrow this film is for you if you are looking for an intense deep heavy piece of art to be dissected and analyzed perhaps you best stick with something by darren aronofsky in other words reviewer djjohn lighten up don't you know a good time when you see one my only complaint is that the movie was just too darn short i guess i'll just have to watch it several more times to get my fill,1
so we get so see added footage of brando interesting but not exactly oscar worthy stuff susannah york was hardly a slouch new scene where lois finds out clark is superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn't notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that let's listen to donner make fun of lester's version that made more logical sense the president talks of the zod defacing the washington monument when it was originally mount rushmore tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd superman's freedom of the press line sounded silly compared to care to step outside which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to clark's earlier scene in the truck stop then there is the ending with the turn back the world to go back in time effect it turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for hackensack n j ever went since it doesn't free zod and company any more,0
this movies chronicles the life and times of william castle he made a series of low budget horror films in the 1950s 1960s that he sold with gimmicks in 13 ghosts you need viewers to see the ghosts they were in color the film was in b w the tingler had theatre seats equipped with a buzzer that jolted the audience when a monster escapes into a movie theatre marabre issued a life insurance policy to all members in case they were frightened to death the movies themselves were pretty bad but the gimmicks had people rushing to see them in this doc there are interviews with directors inspired by castle actors in his movies and his daughter it also gets into his home life and the kind of man he was by all accounts he was a great guy the documentary is affectionate very funny and absolutely riveting it's very short under 90 minutes and there's never a dull moment a must see for castle fans and horror movie fans my one complaint there were very few sequences shown from his pictures that aside this is just great,1

i'm a big fan of the true crime genre but i couldn't sit through this putrid piece it was almost as if dahmer was intended as erotica down to the porn flic soundtrack there was no look at what made dahmer tick no exploration of who his victims were nothing but look at how creepy this guy is and i have to give the filmmakers this much their dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen,0
this one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre slasher movies but it's surely a damn bad movie br br the holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates it's poor production values and stupid plot i mean the sub genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far there is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add br br the clichès are more than boring the gore is minimal and so does the mystery br br this is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that shouldn't be hyped even if it has a video nastie label br br i am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of trash,0
a sweet natured young mountain man with a sad past henry thomas comes upon an abandoned baby girl in the woods and instantly falls in love with her the town elders generally support him in keeping the child though a local temptress cara seymour thinks little of the new family a determined little girl on a long walk and a sinister travelling salesman david strathairn at his creepiest have parallel stories which converge in a fateful way this is a charming slice of life in the ozarks in the same vein as where the lillies bloom the dollmaker all three were shot on location in those beautiful hills and cover the lives of simple living but not simple minded american folk a minimum of strong language and brief but pointed violence make this fairly safe family viewing,1

this movie is an utter waste of time the plot is awful the dialogue is awful br br the acting is ok but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with the photography and some of the special effects are ok too but again there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch there is no logical progression to the story the story line is utter nonsense it isn't even scary for a movie to be scary there has to be at least a small element of believability this movie has no believability at all br br there are only three characters in the movie each character is shallow and has no personality br br most of the special effects and make up work are both badly done or at most mediocre br br i hope you read this and do not waste time on this movie unless you are curious to see an entirely awful movie,0
to be honest i didn't like that much this movie when i saw it for the first time but i guess the trouble is that i haven't seen it in a theater big mistake because the 1 thing to see in cliffhanger is the settings and 2 is the cinematography try to see this movie on the largest tv possible and a great sound system the music is good and puts the movie to a higher level and a commercial potential the more i see it the more i like it br br it's definitely one of renny harlin's best movie this guy knows about action die hard 2 the long kiss good bye etc and it's particularly good in this movie the special effect are great and spectacular stallone really needed that movie get back with success still good to see him,1
i'm not sure this is a spoiler perhaps it is a public service if you are one of those people focused on instant gratification who skip end credits you will miss the final line of the end credits news announcer's voice over which states the u s has just surrendered to nazi germany on may 7 1945 to end wwii here are just a few of the problems with this close br br 1 the older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three more unholy movies in their mind's eye to fill in the yawning chasm between movie events and this startling conclusion br br 2 the average person will really kick themselves that they did not watch one of these unholy fill in the blanks flicks created in their own head for free instead of shelling out time and money to see this unholy from the video store or on cable br br 3 this end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about wwii leading them to the conclusion that george w bush is the latest heir to the nazi throne,0
i saw this for gary busey and fred williamson thinking they were buddy cops they are but busey is in the opening scene then doesn't show up again until like 40 minutes into the movie though every scene he's in is awesome especially when he disguises himself as a blind hobo br br what's incredible about this movie is the plot in the movie fred williamson is trying to find out who stalking and killing phone sex operators at one point i think thats its busey but it turns out i'm only partly right busey is not the killer but he is calling up and harassing the women over the phone why i don't know in no way is he connected to the killer he just does it for kicks i guess,0
a young basketball playing professor of genetics is doing research on the genetic sequence using human fetuses he hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging he's pressured into concluding his research because he hasn't published so the university is having trouble justifying funding him i think br br he does a trial injection on a monkey which quickly dies he then tries it on himself he starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy she's the one who had been demanding results from the research br br initially he seems to have no effects from the injection except some new strength he then realizes that he had some memory loss and starts recalling what happened additionally he starts to appear very unhealthy br br since the movie is named metamorphosis he does eventually change into something else you won't believe your eyes either what he turned into or the absolutely crappy costume the actor is wearing to depict what he's turned into incredibly there's a further change in store the end of the movie is really really absurd br br about the only thing this movie has going for it is that laura gemser is in it but she has a very small part br br i'd once seen a the video box for this with a sculpted plastic form glued to the boxcover possibly it might even have had some electronics in it at one time perhaps eyes that light up the main character's eyes occasionally turn green in the movie the copy i watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had held on the plastic which had been removed the novelty boxcover if it still had it would have been the only reason i would have held onto this movie i'm definitely getting rid of it,0
i just saw this episode this evening on a recently added presentation by one of our local independent channels which now presents two episodes each weekday br br as the gentleman opined in the other previous comment here i agree this may not have been one of the best programs of the series but i find it entertaining nonetheless br br my father was a friend of one of the principals in my hometown cincinnati for whom young rod serling had worked in the media there and i remember dad telling how talented and creative he was remembered there overall twilight zone is certainly one of the true classics in television and given its production during the height of the cold war period provides not only a view of this era in the country but also today a nostalgic picture of production techniques creative viewpoints and the actors of this era several decades ago br br minor spoiler br br this particular story depicts as did other presentations in this series and elsewhere a story where the locale is meant to provide a surprise ending sometimes the characters are on earth from elsewhere while the story at first implies at least one is an earthling these usually contained the message as here of a situation prompted by the doomsday buttons having finally been pressed by the super powers during this cold war period br br viewed today stories like this one provide a nostalgic look at this worldly viewpoint 4 5 decades ago and still provide some food for thought as did this episode br br while the dialog may not have stretched the considerable talents of the leads it still presents a simple important message and a worthwhile 20 some minutes of entertainment and interest,1
really truly abysmally garishly awful but actor clayton moore the movie lone ranger acquits himself competently as an actor he's the only one br br a rare treat for five minutes if you want to plumb the depths of grotesquely transparent special effects southern california as the moon again and again and again and acting so woodenly inept that it may be a spoof except that it's clear that it isn't no humor here except unintentionally br br the dialogue may be worse than any of these other aspects and the costumes well enough said plot what plot bad guy well head bad guy and his henchmen including his earthly agent called krog listen carefully or you'll suspect it's a spoof on the name of mcdonald's founder ray kroc and his unbelievably inept gunsels who however have handguns that never need reloading as does commando cody so there are numerous firefight standoffs br br enjoy,0
images are great and reflect well the landscapes of canada the story was on the other side quite boring to my eyes it was a love story in the woods just like titanic was a love story on a boat i did not feel that grey owl was great environmentalist i usually like lord attenborough but this one was bad,0
robert taylor definitely showed himself to be a fine dramatic actor in his role as a gun slinging buffalo hunter in this 1956 western it was one of the few times that taylor would play a heavy in a film nonetheless this picture was far from great as shortly after this taylor fled to television with the successful series the detectives br br stuart granger hid his british accent and turned in a formidable performance as taylor's partner br br taylor is a bigot here and his hatred for the indians really shows br br another very good performance here was by veteran actor lloyd nolan as an aged drinking old timer who joined in the hunt for buffalo as well in his early scenes nolan was really doing an excellent take off of walter huston in his oscar winning role in the treasure of the sierre madre in 1948 note the appearance of russ tamblyn in the film the following year tamblyn and nolan would join in the phenomenal peyton place br br the writing in the film is stiff at best by the film's end it's the elements of nature that did taylor in how about the elements of the writing here,0
this was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store don't make the same mistake i did this movie is tedious unconvincingly acted and generally boring the dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered i cringed at every scene they shared dennis hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self his role was clearly not a stretch for him and although the movie is supposedly set in puerto rico it feels a lot more like a hollywood movie lot all of the main characters are caucasian and several tend to speak english with pseudo irish accents odd anyway when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store keep walking,0
i laughed a lot while watching this it's an amusing short with a fun musical act and a lot of wackiness the characters are simple but their simplicity adds to the humor stylization the dialog is funny and often unexpected and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow wonderfully there's max who has apparently led a horrible life and there's edward who isn't sure what life he wants to lead my favorite character was tom edward's insane boss tom has a short role but a memorable one highly recommended for anyone who likes silly humor and you can find it online now which is a bonus i am a fan of all of jason's cartoons and can't wait to see what he comes out with next,1
at least something good came out of damon runyon's misguided attempt to sentimentalize the mafia guys and dolls the seemingly indestructible stage musical was captured on film in 1955 by joseph l mankiewicz all about eve in a colorful enjoyable movie that featured an all star cast including vivian blaine from the original broadway show jean simmons whose character bears an odd resemblance to audrey hepburn in roman holiday and two of the all time great leading men frank sinatra and marlon brando both of whom had recently won oscars for best supporting actor from here to eternity and best actor on the waterfront and were on the top of their game one listen to brando singing luck be a lady tonight speaks volumes about where the early dylan got his voice stubby kaye steals the show as nicely nicely johnson who brings down the house with sit down you're rocking the boat the ubiquitous sheldon leonard adds yet another page to his rogue's gallery of screen gangsters the film has a bright cartoonish look anticipating the pop art of the early 1960s the characters speak in a stylized patois apparently based on yiddish idioms although the film's social attitudes and gender roles are dated it's all great fun and even the gentle kidding of the salvation army is harmless and reflects no real animosity toward organized religion just seeing sinatra and brando in the same film is reason enough to watch this movie but it has lots of other attractions to offer during its 149 minutes,1
as this happens to be one of most favorite novels i was very excited to see the move i was not disappointed yes of course there are a few things that i could pick on but i think that the movie stuck true to the book and was a really good movie it seems that stephen king films mostly get a bad review but this is one of the good ones it is such a dark story which i guess is why i like it and what is better than the dead coming to life and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too if you have seen the movie do yourself a huge favor and now read the book it is a well written screen play the actors could have done a better job i only say this for rachel and ellie she was so whinny i liked everyone else a lot and most important to me it stuck true with the novel,1
fox's the true story of jesse james 1957 is a remarkably poor widescreen remake of their prestigious 1939 tyrone power henry fonda classic jesse james i'm not sure where the fault lies but the casting in this version of the two central characters the uneven direction of nicholas ray and the ham fisted screenplay must surely have something to do with it br br in the late thirties and forties tyrone power was fox's top leading man but in the fifties his star began to wane and studio head darryl zanuck started to groom newcomer robert wagner to take his place this was a major error on zanuck's part as wagner proved to be a less than a suitable replacement with the possible exceptions of broken lance 1954 and between heaven hell 1956 it is hard to think of wagner distinguishing himself in anything also jeffrey hunter was nothing more than a fox contract player before being assigned to play frank james to wagner's jesse in the true story of jesse james borrowed from the studio the previous year this actor's one distinguishing mark was his excellent and revealing performance in john ford's classic the searchers but his playing here along with wagner as the second half of the james brothers is nothing short of boring neither player bring any personality or colour to their respective roles they totally miss the mark lacking the charisma and appeal so vividly displayed by power and fonda in the original the movie is also marred by too many flashbacks and with the all over the place screenplay wagner as the robin hood of the american west comes across as a charmless introverted twit that you can feel no empathy for whatsoever the supporting cast are hardly worth mentioning but it is a shame to see such a great actress as agnes moorhead barely getting a look in as ma james br br the best aspects of this uninvolving so so western is the wonderful cinemascope colour cinematography by the great joe mcdonald and the excellent music score by the underrated and little known composer leigh harline,0
it's hard to tell you more about this film without spoiling it i enjoyed it because i wasn't expecting what i was seeing but an ordinary sex drama so it's a pscyho sexual thriller in which nothing is what it seems it features emmanuelle seigner no stranger to the genre and to nudity in which her husband polanski had directed her and a creepy performance did i say creepy yes creepy from toreton bernard tavernier's actor it looks like a pascal bruckner meets roman polanski better than bitter moon like a chabrol gone astray or clouzot thriller i have seen someone mentioning les diaboliques but closer to georges franju's les yeux sans visage eyes without a face the godfather of dr phibes and more a gem i am just afraid they will blow this into a hollywood remake like they did with nighwatch and the vanishing,1
i think that this movie was reasonbaly good it's kinda weird that now the olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all i enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on full house anyway the casting was good and the movie was somewhat funny i kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names it's just kind of an older version of it takes two,1
well i do like the gore in this movie it is genuingly unsetteling anyone that's been to the dentist will know why the story really isn't that bad corbin bersen's character's motivations do make a lot more sense than in most horror movies br br i've seen worse acting directing script etc but at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie so it comes down to if you enjoy that type of thing or not i tried to watch the sequel but it was exactly exactly the same thing as this movie just keep in mind if you enjoy people getting tortured at the dentist then this is the movie for you,0
disney might just be on to something here first they had remember the titans with denzel a story based on truth involving sports and a small town in middle america now with quaid and the rookie yet another sports story based on truth br br both movies move you to tears at times and both make you smile and feel all warm after seeing them my wife and i took in the rookie and we expected it to be a great feel good type movie we were not let down when asked if we'd be buying this on dvd when it comes out it was a no brainer most definately,1
as low budget indies go you will usually find that you get what you pay for and let me just say i didn't pay much for frightworld br br writer director david r williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park besieged by the vengeful spirit of a slain serial killer not a bad premise but executed with a bevy of low budget mistakes the camera work tries to be too cleaver for it's audience by constantly using shaky quick cuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing gory or scary to show us this becomes evident right off the bat as we are introduced to the would be killer and soon realize that the acting is the scariest thing happening after a painfully long title sequence we are brought back to modern times yet the acting remains the same frightworld does generate some rather unique cinematography when showing scenery from inside the fun house but with an extremely long running time it can't save the film from it's below average indie hell br br there is some mediocre nudity but not much for gore which is usually the saving grace for these types of movies br br fans of really bad b movies might find something of interest here otherwise don't spend a lot of cash,0
based on ray russell's dark bestseller this john watcher in the woods hough directed bust has little going for it br br though it does not lack gory violence it lack narrative sensibility and characters br br the incubus of the title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into vaginas during intercourse or to be more precise rape br br john cassavetes moonlighting from his successful directing career is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women br br horrific possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are not considered and neither is the audience's tolerance for slow moving garbage br br the script's reluctance to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major problems with this vapid big schlong on the loose exercise,0
this was among the stupidest and preachiest of the anti nuke films out of the 1980s br br the idea that a kid and a basketball star could change the world is pretty far fetched given how many children's peace marches and celebrity protests there were and are br br but the idea that the soviet union would agree to a total nuclear disarmament because some apparatchik kids learned of a silent protest in the west is ludicrous br br what ended the cold war america's tough dare i say reaganesque stance and the internal failures of socialism it was not the peace marches the die ins or films like amazing grace chuck miracle mile or testament,0
if the lion king was a disney version of hamlet then the lion king 3 hakuna matata is a disney version of guildenstern and rosencrantz are dead just like tom stoppard's beguiling film we get to view the action from the point of view of two of the minor characters from the original timon the meerkat with a penchant for breaking into song at the drop of a hat and pumbaa the warthog with flatulence issues by following their story rather than simba's we get to see why all the animals bowed down as simba was presented from pride rock we find out what made timon and pumbaa decide to follow simba back to pride rock to oust scar and we find out how they dealt with the hyena's once and for all nathan lane as timon gets most of the best jokes but he is ably supported by ernie sabella as pumbaa it is also good to hear matthew broderick and whoopi goldberg reprising their roles julie kavner and jerry stiller lend their distinctive voices to two new characters timon's mother and uncle the only downside is the constant stop start rewind fast forward device which doesn't always help to progress the story having said that there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie with more laughs than any other third in a disney series movie hakuna matata is worth watching if only for the hot tub scene which is still funny despite being a little bit predictable,1
this film was horrible the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the real world the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film school br br i do not recommend this film to anyone who a knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations b knows any detail about film making or appreciation br br i do recommend this film to the average or below average mind i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber if you must watch this film on a full mind i highly recommend some kind of inebriation br br it is a total waste of what little production value it has,0
i'm trying to picture the pitch for dark angel i'm thinking matrix i'm thinking bladerunner i'm thinking that chick that plays faith in angel wearing shiny black leather or some chick just like her leave that one with us only get this we'll do it without any plot dialogue character decent action or budget just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes right br br flashy shallow dreary formulaic passionless tedious dull dumb humourless desultory barely competent live action anime without any action or indeed any life sf just the way joe fanboy likes it in fact,0
wow what can i say first off imdb says this is in the late 60s which means carlito would be very close to going to prison he got out in 75 and said he was in for 5 years they used a bunch of nobody actors and a story that didn't even make sense they bring back only one actor guzman and hes playing a totally different guy why did it end with him and this puerto rican chick wheres gale he said he was in love with her before wheres kleinfeld he said he knew him forever you'd think he'd have been in this one and if this made sense where are rocco and the black dude in the first one it was all just stupid this is an insult to pacino and the first film,0
i spent eight years running movie theatres in the 80's and 90's this was by far the worst film i ever showed to the public one thing that made it so bad was that it put on airs of trying to be a great inspiring film even the great gregory peck could not save this horrid piece of drivel from being far less than mediocre jamie lee curtis in an early non horror film role demonstrated clearly that she had not yet learned to act she's still trying but it isn't getting much better br br i'm sorry and here's the spoiler international nuclear disarmament is never going to happen just because it makes children afraid to play little league baseball even the shows on nick and the disney channel are not stupid enough to try to make us believe that dreck br br this is not worth the time you would waste watching it on cable tv it is not worth the price of a movie rental your dollar would be better spent on an extra package of microwave popcorn to go with the other movie you picked because it can only be better than this,0
i enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the biscuit the script and dialogue is laughable the acting was awful where did they get them from music was ok i have to say luckily i didn't buy or rent the movie but its now disposed of br br i was geared up at the beginning when the stranger martin sheen started to tell his story i have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between hopalong and tex where hopalong shot tex's finger off and told him to practise for 40 years to reach his league but thats where it all went pear shaped thereafter i had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better never did,0
lars von trier's europa is a worthy echo of the third man about an american coming to post world war ii europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mystery br br jean marc barr plays leopold kessler a german american who refused to join the us army during the war arrives in frankfurt as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on the zentropa railway what he doesn't know is the war is still secretly going on with an underground terrorist group called the werewolves who target american allies leopold is strongly against taking any sides but is drawn in and seduced by katharina hartmann barbara sukowa the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company her father was a nazi sympathizer but is pardoned by the american colonel harris eddie considine because he can help get the german transportation system up and running again the colonel soon enlists or forces leopold to be a spy without giving him a choice or chance to think about it to see if the werewolves might carry out attacks on the trains br br soon leopold is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noir ish way where everyone and everything is not what it seems its amazing to watch the naive leopold deal with everything his lover the terrorists the colonel annoying passengers his disgruntled uncle even the railway company's officials who come to examine his work ethic before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control the film is endlessly unpredictable br br the film stylishly shot it always takes place at night during the winter with lots of falling snow its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout also background screens displaying images that counter act with the images up front add max von sydow's hypnotic narration and europa becomes a dreamlike place that's out of this world br br this is now a personal favorite film of mine,1
i always enjoyed watching this when it came on television during prime time every year in the 60's it's a typical hollywood history epic dramatized stylized and full of inaccuracies but so what it's an entertaining movie and a good looking film cecil b demille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film his son in law actor anthony quinn who had the supporting role of beluche in the '38 film is the director in his directorial debut and swan song as he had never directed a film before and never would again demille assembled a crew who had recently worked on his 10 commandments to help quinn pull it off including longtime demille associate producer actor henry wilcoxon overseeing the project also from the 10 commandments are screenwriter jesse lasky cinematographer loyalk griggs assistant director francisco day 2nd unit director arthur rosson art directors walter tyler and hal pereira set directors sam comer and ray moyer costume designers edith head john jensen and ralph lester who as a costume design team received the buccaneer's only oscar nomination a great cast here from team demille headed up by yul brynner as pirate jean lafitte and charleton heston as future president general andrew jackson also in the cast are charles boyer e g marshall lorne greene claire bloom and inger stevens at just over two hours it drags in some spots but makes up for it with some excellent battle scenes i would give it a 7 5 out of 10,1
this movie wastes virtually every actor's talents in what could best be charitably called a potboiler br br despite it's action packed 'top gun' opening it is all downhill from there with plenty of stereotypes and unlikely situations following each other until you try to choke yourself on your popcorn br br there are so many dead end story lines in this movie i was guessing at one point it was made by splicing together a discarded tv series br br quinn's mexican drug lord role is laughable and his 'associates' plucked right out of a 1970's quinn martin cop show costner's character is wooden and gives us no reason to believe he actually fell in love with mendez' wife nor are we convincingly led to believe the wife is aching for companionship and will jump the first hot body coming along br br definitely a 'b' movie at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved,0
this film needs to be seen the truest picture of what is going on in the world that i've seen since darwin's nightmare go see it and if you're lucky enough to have it open in your city be sure to see it on the big screen instead of dvd the writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for the ideas to come through though hardly perfect joan cusack is amazing and the rest of the cast is good too it's inspiring that john cusack got this movie made and i believe he had to use some of his own money to do it it's a wild absurd ride obviously made without the resources it needed but still succeeds jon stewart steven colbert snl even bill maher haven't shown the guts to say what this film says,1
after seeing the previews i felt that this movie was going to be a nice improvement over that fast furious series so i already expected it to have a lacking storyline but at least this time it won't be loaded with a bunch of powerless civics with fart cans unfortunately i was wrong if you could only imagine a fast furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you br br this is the absolute worst movie i had ever seen i'm being nice no i would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said not only was the storyline non existent but the action was crap too i guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie for an example there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a slr mclaren to win and after the bit where eddy griffin got in a fight with one of his girls an imus comment would work in this case the girl asks to pull over and get out of the plane and of course they do in the middle of the desert after this wonderful scene i couldn't take it anymore so i only got to see half of this monstrosity this is the first movie i had ever walked out on afterwards i had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells br br i gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option you're better off going to the local car show and stopping at a strip joint on the way home i will keep all viewers in my prayers,0
this movie deserves credit for its original approach it combines elements of theater film and epic storytelling unfortunately it falls flat on all levels the films biggest weakness is it's unwillingness to commit to anything it has camp moralistic and epic elements without ever committing to any of them as for the story itself chretien de troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable unbearably innocent percival into a most ungallant and rude churl br br most likely two types of people will see this francophiles or arthuriophiles speaking as one of the latter i found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story,0
italian horror suspense film about a wealthy english lord who cruises pubs and taverns for girls with red hair just like his recently deceased wife evelyn you know he must have really loved his wife because he brings them to his home a huge rotting castle and makes them disrobe and then tortures them whips them and kills them the most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the film's end we see this guy played by antonio de teffe as the hero of the film anyway soon under the advice of his playboy uncle roberto maldera de teffe settles down with a girl he meets at his uncle's party she moves in and strange things begin to happen to de teffe's fragile state of mind he begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally well just look at the title if you are still curious also family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions poor aunt agatha she looks like she might even be younger than de teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old meets her fate in a foxy fashion another man is injected and then buried alive and of course there is a whole explanation as to why how evelyn did what she did director emilio miraglia does do some things fairly well the settings in the film are well suited for this film though trying to make us believe it is england is ludicrous at best none of the actors look english many having dark black hair and mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an englishman wouldn't be caught dead in the cars drive on their wrong side of the road but all that notwithstanding the crypt scene was effectively shot and i liked the cheesy resolution too and of course any film with the sultry red headed erika blanc is always a plus there is a streak of sexual perversion however which i found somewhat appalling with the idea that torturing women was quite alright and healthy in order to relieve one of his mental demons c'mon,0
this film is awful the screenplay is bad the is script mediocre and even the sex scenes are worthless the thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking this movie was shot in a dark shadowy and monochromatic style a la war of the worlds which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film greg morrisey's brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film the twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic the only highlight is sharon stone's performance as catherine tramell faithfully continued in this sequel but it isn't enough to make up for the other shortcomings the only circumstance under which a basic instinct 3 should be made would be if michael douglas agrees to join the cast,0
strictly a routine by the numbers western directed by genre mainstay andrew v mclaglen so is that any wonder army colonel brian keith spars with smarmy bandit dean martin who has just kidnapped the colonel's wife honor blackman who never found her niche after playing pussy galore in goldfinger fist fights shoot outs stagecoach robberies and denver pyle in a supporting role in other words absolutely nothing new or original talking in a low monotone throughout keith gets to dally with a prostitute something of a shock after his run on tv's family affair but otherwise this low rent material wastes keith's amiable talents it's also bad news for dino who doesn't seem to notice or care hack direction poor writing and several unfunny attempts at lowball humor from,0
excruciatingly slow paced over scripted black comedy with a too clever premise and bad acting br br maybe this would have worked as a twilight zone or tales from the crypt episode but by the last half you just want it to get to its predictable ending and be done with it already,0
this movie had potential and i was willing to give it a try but there are so many timeline problems that are so obvious it's hard to swallow being treated like such an idiot br br rise to power is set in the late sixties carlito's way is set in the mid to late seventies for this movie to be realistic it would have to be set in the fifties if not the late forties br br rise to power has no sign of gail pennelope ann miller no sign of kleinfeld no sign of rolando that carlito supposedly ran with in his hey day none of the primary characters in the original film were in this movie we're supposed to believe that carlito met all these people in the span of a few years br br rise to power ends with carlito walking down the beach talking about retiring in paradise which is what he wanted to do in the original film also the pre quel creates the rocco and earl characters what's supposed to happen with them since they are clearly not in carlito's way it's also hard to understand how carlito could have the relationship with the italians he has in the original film watching the events of rise to power where are the taglialucci's in this film there is probably seven years between the two films and he spends five of them in prison it's like trying to put a square plug into a round hole br br it is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making some bucks by making an average gangster film and throwing a character called carlito brigante into the story the film had some good moments but i think they would have been better off leaving this movie to stand by itself instead of trying to make it a prequel to carlito's way br br if you feel determined to see this movie the only advice i can give is to not think of the movie as a linear pre quel think of it like the spaghetti westerns with clint eastwood's man with no name in other words two movies that have the same character but aren't necessarily connected with each other,0
this is one of the most god awful movies ever shaq better just stick to basketball this movie took away apart of my life i will never have back i will make fun of this movie until i die and then some it is so horrible it is not even funny mst3000 would have a blast with this one,0
this is hands down the greatest stand up show ever i've seen a lot of stand up shows been to a lot of stand up shows and watch bet's comic view but i have never seen anyone who could match the skills of murphy on this show the impressions are excellent the skits are great and the timing is perfect you can even tell the crowd gets really into when he did raw a few years later it was also really good but this is 1 in my book also shows that at one time particularly the early to mid eighties that murphy was funny my favorite parts of the show is when he is retelling the family barbecue and ice cream mooommmm the ice cream man is coming another great part is where his mom is like clint eastwood,1
this sequel is thoroughly uneven incoherent and rambling in plot if there really is one and tries too damned hard to be modern ridiculous out of period and character 21 st century style songs predominate and cute yawn there are too many manufactured belaboured jokes with animals the actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot even glenn close and she is normally very good sweeps through this film parodying herself as the original de ville and the lead from sunset boulevard it's a film that isn't even good to look at this is a very good example of a bad and pointless sequel even basic instinct 2 had a plot characterisation and acceptable acting this doesn't it is bad,0
shakespeare's plays have a way of transcending time the language somehow breaks the time barrier but perhaps it is the actors who really do that br br after the disappointment in romeo and juliet the version with claire danes and leonardo dicaprio was hesitant take on another modern rendition of shakespeare to my surprise othello was great br br iago's character was played so well by the kenneth fellow even thoough iago is really evil and despicable the character was played so well that it does what shakespeare intended for the charater to be a pleasure for the audience to hate i have to say that fishburne's performance here was really good as well br br i recommend this for shakespeare scholars and lazy students who refuse to read the book alike,1
first nobody can understand why this movie is rated so poorly not only is this the first real horrific movie since a very long time for me who am pretty hard boiled with a decades long experience of horror starting with driving through dark rides ghost trains as a child second the main actress cheri christian has a face that lets you hope she will be the leading actress in major pictures of the future third this woman is that tremendously beautiful that i suggest the directors retire all those cameron diazes eva mendezes and how ever the names of these ephemeral bulb lights are mrs christian is not a light but a sun br br however dark remains is also of considerable metaphysical importance they idea that photographs shows creatures of the intermediary reign between reality and imagination that are not visible with one' own eyes is not new but i have never seen in a movie before that those creatures are visible on the photographs only for certain people and only to certain times this means that the photo is not just an iconic picture of reality by which reality turns into a sign but becomes an alternative form of reality which can change as the real reality can being a sign the changing of the picture means that it influences the photographed objects i e the sign behaves like an object now in our usual world of perception it is common that objects change signs f ex if someone grows a bird his photograph will show him with beard not without as it did before but the opposite the changing of objects by signs would imply that the photo with beard is first and only then the beard grows on the man this is very simply expressed the case that happen with the photos taken by the main character in the prison in this movie this is new and we must be thankful for everything new in horror movies which usually just repeat and reorder effects and features that are already well known mostly since the silent time,1
checking the spoiler alert just in case br br perhaps one of the most horrendous movies i have ever seen mazes and monsters felt like i wasted 101 minutes of my life the only redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious but just ended up being funny since they were so bad evil dead anyone unfortunately for m m fortunately for us it did not develop a cult following and result in a trilogy this movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character robbie played by hanks encountered throughout the film it ended up being a fear mongering video about stereotypes that helped fuel the d d is the devil movement in the 80s br br if you want to avoid wasting your time and money steer clear of this junk br br p s even though the cover looks kinda interesting which is why i guess my brother bought it it in no way takes place in a fantasy realm unless you consider new england or new york city to be such a place,0
oh dear the first time i heard of this bad show was when one of my friends was yelling like an idiot johny test while we were playing video games i thought he was confusing johny quest by the way one of the best cartoons i've ever seen in my life and changing the quest with test its something weird that i'm wrong but actually i was wrong he wasn't changing nothing he heard of this show br br one day while watching tv i heard that cartoon network was going to be released i wasn't sure of what was the plot of this show so i adventured myself to watch it and here is my answer i want my damn hour back because i watched this crap and my gym partner's a monkey br br this is one of the worst shows i've ever seen first the beginning with the most stupid song in the world then the plot oh where are my manners i haven't said the plot of this show is about a boy who has to amazingly intelligent sisters that have a lab and make experiments with their own brother ohhh now i see why his name is johny test he is the test of his sisters experiments br br you know i honestly miss dexter's lab before it was transformed to the new dexter a total crap too this is a bad copy of that old good show except that this show is amazingly bad don't watch it make something more productive in that half hour than watch this crap,0
and i really mean that i caught it last night on vh1 and i was not expecting it to be so good this is now one of my favorites i must add that it has a killer soundtrack,1
this film is roughly what it sounds like a futuristic version of the cinderella legend but with songs and fairly tame sex scenes the film is not sure what it wants to be and pretty much ends up a mess it's more expensive looking than most of director al adamson's films but it's not at the same budget level that viewers have come to expect from sci fi films the actors are pretty bad and unlike most adamson films there are no former big namers or b actors some of the music is ok but it's easy to see why cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years,0
this is perhaps the creepiest display of santa claus ever committed to any medium whether it be a book a picture or a movie santa looks like a perv looking down on the children and the twisted story of bringing merlin in to help him defeat one of satan's minions pitch doesn't make things any better it's laughable to say the least with bad effects even for 1959 standards if a kid were to watch this movie he'd have nightmares and never want santa to visit they'd be scarred for life imagine the kid's in a christmas story when they start screaming after being put on santa's lap that's how this would turn out if kid's see this movie,0

first of all this film was not released to theatres tested poorly they say i say they figured the story of crooked cops politicians dedicated newspaper people had been done to death just send it dvd cable tv take the money run br br that being said i usually like this type of movie especially with this named cast morgan freeman justin timberlake kevin spacey br br l l cool j cary elways john heard on the distaff side piper perabo roslyn sanchez br br the plot story have been done to death but the above cast brings life to this violent movie it is actually watchable br br justin timberlake is good as the dedicated young reporter for a throw away newspaper edited by morgan freeman the others are either crooked cops politicians or somewhat decent guys the 2 ladies are the girl friends of ll cool j justin timberlake do whats required it is quite violent many killings etc not for children by no means is the a great film but for what it is the cast it is definitely good br br ratings out of 4 86 points out of 100 imdb 8 out of 10,1
sandra bernhard is quite a character and certainly one of the funniest women on earth she began as a stand up comedienne in the 1970s but her big break came in 1983 when she starred opposite jerry lewis and robert de niro in scorsese's underrated masterpiece the king of comedy her film career never quite took off though she did make a couple of odd but entertaining pictures such as dallas doll 1994 or dinner rush 2000 but the most amazing parts were those she created for herself br br without you i'm nothing is undoubtedly her best effort it's an adaptation of her smash hit off broadway show which made her a superstar  and madonna's best friend for about four years in ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes sandra turns from nina simone to diana ross talks about her childhood andy warhol and san francisco and performs songs made famous by burt bacharach prince or sylvester director john boskovich got sandra to do a 90 minute tour de force performance that's both sexy and uniquely funny if you are a bernhard fan you can't miss out this film it's a tribute as well to her weird beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne and it has influenced filmmakers in their work  hedwig and the angry inch for instance would look a lot different if without you i'm nothing didn't exist,1
i don't recall walking out of a movie theater except this once not only that but i was with 7 friends and we all wanted to go an uninteresting plot characters made of clay violence with no point i didn't care when the good guys died i didn't care when the bad guys got it the fantasy and magic was laid on thick as liver pudding and there was no coherency in short fine entertainment if you happen to be spending an eternity in hell,0
the following are some of the most blaring problems with this movie 1 clichés abound seriously awful twists are everywhere br br 2 the narrative jumps around in time which would be fine if done well but it's not br br 3 lame characters that don't develop so much as either remain utterly static or drastically change for no good reason br br 4 big one horrible acting over the top from nearly every person br br the following are some of the best points from the movie 1 the lead is damn good looking br br as i see it there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie a people who can sit through 90 minutes of tripe simply because the lead is attractive br br b people who often think to themselves i like hollywood dreck rife with clichés and overacting but if only i could watch it in korean there's a lot of good korean cinema out there so why waste your time with garbage,0
body slam 1987 is a flat out terrible movie the low budget reeks the direction is pedestrian at best and the writing and acting is lame but if you're into old school wrestling circa 1970's through the mid 80' then you'll be more entertained than the average viewer i have to warn you this movie stinks on ice i gave it a two because i felt like being generous this turkey was directed by stunt master hal needham the stars are roddy piper the tonga kid and a bunch of scrub wrestlers and c list actors dirk benedict br br the synopsis of this movie is about a promoter who wants to combine hair rock and wrestling but their are others that don't want him to succeed there's more but i don't want to spoil it for you if you can stomach the bad acting and inane storyline there's a few surprises near the end for die hard wrestling fans br br i wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemy and i mean it,0
if you really enjoyed the 2002 resident evil movie then you should just see it instead of waisting 2 hours you'll never get back i can not believe that no one has commented that this movie is just a cheap knock off of re first a special commando force is the unique defense for a facility with a computer matrix that has an ai and holographic projection and this hive rip off has a series of traps that inevitably kill off one member of the squad at a time there's even a chess reference in the code names which was in the dialog of re despite the fact that there are no zombies the rook the movie's nemesis is some sort of bio creature very pail in color suggesting necrotic tissue with a lot of cyborg components just like a super mutant of re so a wag of the finger to mr richard taylor for claiming any credit for this story br br they are not the same movie obviously but the writer got the idea watching resident evil i think,0
this film has the look and feel of a student film project yeah there are some interesting albeit gimmicky edits and shots but the end result was juvenile br br the director didn't seem to be saying look at this film it seemed as if he were saying look at me i'm a director br br thumbs down,0

spinal tap was funny because if you knew a little about heavy metal you saw in jokes all over the place if you know anything about porn this mock documentary will leave you cold everything in it rings false br br spinal tap was funny because it took a familiar world and pushed it over the top this film is decidedly not funny because it paints a picture of how porn is made that bears no relationship to the real world br br the acting here is uniformly awful but that would not matter much if the core idea of the movie were good but it's not,0
the movie follows the events of the novel cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni could be translated as the most beloved among humans written by marin preda a very controversial book and movie a novel which became something like the bible or the story of hamlet very popular and hard to get due to its satiric contents over the communist regime it represents the drama of the intellectual man the humanist in a red world a movie filled with passion fear sexuality all the great ingredients for a great movie recipe one of the greatest romanian movies despite its psychological charge after all it is an european movie,1
well i do disagreed with the other comment posted piedras is much much better them magnolia or any of the other films that were mentioned br br specially about non real characters i think that someone just wrote that only because he never lived in the spanish society like i did and i'm not spanish is a very real film with real characters very well done by one of the best spanish actress antonia san juan br br about be a european film in contrast with an american film well we different societies personally i dislike american modern films a lot i like the classics and some of the andy american films but they are very few br br is a film about the continuous constitution of a person liked or not we all make mistakes but some can learn about the mistakes,1
firstly this is a very dated film non focused in its exposition of the left wing political revolution honestly when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to cease to be intellectual which in itself is quite nonsensical since the answer was arrived at by precisely being intellectual it reduces me to despair as if we all should return to being apes in the name of equality it is simply ridiculous our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities but this does not mean we should not educate ourselves to the highest possible degree but no doubt this non educational message ties in with godard's use of rock music hence the rolling stones br br the song 'sympathy for the devil' whose creation we witness and from which the film takes its name is in fact nothing special the chord sequence which is not especially original was used to much better effect in led zeppelin's 'thankyou' led zeppelin ii apart form that 'sir' mick jagger declaims in his usually nebulous manner rather like bob dylan notice how the first melodic phrase is unimaginatively repeated over again to form the verse br br besides the fact that the black panthers depicted in this film don't seem to know what they are fighting for the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography a message that in fact undermines the sexual 'liberation' of the 1960s and today indeed a message that would belie the behaviour of the rolling stones around the time the film was made br br no wonder the dvd came free with the sunday times for a truly profound historical exposition of left wing sympathy listen to luigi nono's masterpiece 'al gran sole carico'd'amore',0

where oh where to begin in describing the comprehensive wretchedness of neil labute's latest attempt at film making br br there are many kinds of film fans out there but by far the most annoying and shallow is mr intriguing you know mr intriguing don't you br br he's the fellow that no matter how stupid lame and incomprehensibly dull a film is he says gee i don't know why everyone hated it i found it intriguing he's the kind of guy who finds the scent of dog poop intriguing especially when he smears it in the shape of a hitler mustache on his upper lip and marches about the house ranting about the brilliance of science fiction that features thinly veiled references to greek mythology he's also the guy this version of the wicker man was made for no one else could stand it,0
bend it like beckham reminds me of the best of those 80's teeny bopper movies directed by john hughes everything takes place in a bubble gum colored world where everyone is attractive there are some easily resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop tunes nothing wrong with this however bend it like beckham is an absolute treat from beginning to end my wife and i found ourselves totally won over by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it and at the end as embarrassing as this is to admit we applauded and we saw this by the way in our living room not in a theatre watch this movie and enjoy br br grade b,1
there are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like stardust did all throughout the course of the film as magically fairy tale like as the princess bride stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's exciting hilarious and equipped with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable characters michelle pfeiffer and robert deniro's especially i challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile from the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finish br br ten stars and not a decimal less,1
to make a good movie you either need excellent actors or an excellent director you need at least one of the two in this eye of the needle we have none br br i don't even remember the name of the director he mustn't have done much in his career i like very much donald sutherland but he absolutely cannot be the main actor in a movie he falls short sutherland is excellent in a movie when he appears for not more than 15 minutes i would say for instance that sutherland was excellent in jfk of oliver stone when he talked to kevin costner on the bench of a park for 10 minutes non stop without even taking a breath wonderful but sutherland being the principal actor in a movie is no good br br kate nelligan she is probably good for tv series the dvd is awful terrible colors terrible light i couldn't even appreciate the scenery of storm island for how lousy the photography was br br this ken follett story was good but it's a pity they turned it into an uninteresting movie,0
it was pointed out in a now deleted post from another imdb user that anyone who might see the medusa touch should be warned about a scene that's eerily reminiscent of the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks in nyc but i hope anyone reading this will consider this warning despite an interesting pedigree producer elliott kastner produced harper and the long goodbye co producer arnon milchan co produced the oscar nominated l a confidential and screenwriter john briley won an oscar for gandhi and an international cast i found the medusa touch to be a heavy handed unintentional laugh riot it was a poorly directed horribly written and acted mess it tried to capitalize on the 70s telekinetic thrillers genre the movie fails on many counts please consider carrie and the underrated the fury both directed by brian depalma they were two entertaining and exciting thrillers that dealt with the same subject matter,0

on the night of his bachelor party paul coleman jason lee meets the gorgeous dancer becky julia stiles in the bar they drink a lot together and in the next morning he wakes up with her on the bed his future mother in law calls him and informs that his fiancée karen selma blair might be arriving in his apartment and he desperately asks becky to leave his place in a hurry sooner he finds that her has crabs and later in the preparation of his wedding dinner party he realizes that becky is the cousin of karen this is the beginning of a very funny comedy with hilarious situations the first attraction of this movie certainly is the central trio of actresses and actor julia stiles and selma blair who are excellent actresses and extremely gorgeous and jason lee who is amazingly funny have good performances i laughed a lot along the story but there are some scenes that are really hilarious for example when paul finds becky in his bed when he finds her paints his imagination in many situations in the drugstore trying to buy and get explanations about the crab medicine most of the scenes of his neighbor the minister when karen calls the department store or when the police finds a suspect of assaulting paul i could number many other scenes but better off the reader rent or buy this movie and have lots of fun my vote is seven br br title brazil louco por elas crazy for them,1

with a title like that it's above and beyond my comprehension how this movie just did not appeal to me granted there's a few decently sleazy moments and a little gore but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at profuse shock tactics the inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road he and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods he ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement the heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her a grabby neighbor and her sexually abrasive boss he explains to her that he is going to kill them all she winds up killing him and then turning her focus towards the men or pigs whom she tortures and kills herself most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sh t eating and genitalia destroying all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild the best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful man rape surely i spit on your corpse i p ss on your grave was intended as an unofficial sequel to i spit on your grave based on mainly the title and a reference the main character gives suggesting her mother was camille keaton i personally consider that to be a wildly blasphemous assertion this movie is a boring amateurish mess that strives for shocks but failed miserably,0

first off i would like to say that i am a fan of chris rock i like his other movies but this movie is just like my summary the biggest sack of crap ever in the beginning chris rock plays an aspiring comedian who get stage fright at a comedy building called the apollo on his way home from a gig while riding his bike he sees this woman he likes and is hit by a truck a little while later he chooses the body of an old white and selfish millionaire then he dresses up like the music group outkast while trying to replay the scene from the original where he comes out as a jockey second he goes back to the apollo and tries to be the comedian he tried to be in his previous body and starts dissing the white population and tries to be black do you get my drift this movie is awful it tries too hard to be like the original and in the process comes out looking like a sack of crap just take my advice don't even watch this movie,0

i felt like i was watching the fast and the furious again but with different actors and a little bit different plot i will say the cars in the film are very cool so if you like fast cars then you will probably find this movie mildly entertaining i also liked nadia bjorlin because i've seen her from days of our lives she is a really good singer but too bad they gave her such lousy songs to sing in this movie i mean songs about cars not exactly what you would here on the radio since it is a hollywood film you have to give this story a little lee way but in real life i don't think any average joe would come across such a hot girl as nadia bjorlin who can drive a race car fix a car engine and be a lead singer it's just all very silly br br another side note any one willing to wager 25 million on a car race is a nut but it was kinda of cool at the end when natasha stops right before the finish line and screws michael over priceless br br final verdict this movie is for car freaks so if you like fast cars then i'd recommend this,0
funny sad charming these are all words that floated through my head while i was watching this beautiful simple film br br it is rare that a movie truly moves me but shall we dance accomplished that with grace to spare gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movie viewing history it left me with a quiet sense of exultation but with a small touch of sadness mixed in br br and the dancing oh yes the dancing even if you are not a lover of the art or can't put one foot in front of another the steps displayed here will take your breath away and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can it was absolutely enchanting even the parts that show sugiyama's touchingly portrayed by koji yakusho stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous child like way and yet this film was not entirely about dancing but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings we witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast br br beauty pain emotion all the love and little agonies of life are here expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture br br,1

foxes is one movie i remember for it's portrayal of teenagers in the late 1970's as i am exactly jodie foster's age i related to this movie it deals with the frustrations temptations relationships rebellion of youth the soundtrack is great with inspiring rock eg more than a feeling by boston and sad numbers like on the radio by donna summer the music of my late teens yep i'll always remember this one even if it wasn't huge,1
gandhi my father is a well made movie it nicely portrays the life of gandhiji's eldest son harilal his character his differences with his father his love for his family his desire to stand on his own his failure his ego akshaye khanna completely justifies the role of harilal just not him everyone did well in the roles they played darshan jariwala is the best on screen gandhiji i've ever seen but i will cut three points as there were few shortcomings br br first movie was fifteen twenty minutes longer than it should have second the movie needed more research into harilal's character somewhere the character looked incomplete also his relation with his brothers was not shown there was no mention of any other child of gandhiji in the whole movie i believe the character like harilal should be having at least some differences his brothers as well considering the egoist nature of harilal br br anyways despite some shortcomings i liked the movie recommended,1
i was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in north carolina instead i watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the duke family and this went on and on if mr mcelwee's family had prevailed over the dukes i doubt that mr mcelwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco related diseases i grew up near the area where mr mcelwee's family began it tobacco business i expected more than mcewee's continual focus on his family i learned very little about the history of tobacco in the nc economy and the ramifications to the state's economy by tighter regulation of tobacco the countless references to the movie bright leaves are out of place so what if gary cooper played mr mcelwee's great grandfather does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the north carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film i didn't,0
i just love malle's documentaries they are so effortless and simple but still so fascinating i have no idea why this documentary works it is about glencoe minnesota 5000 people live there and nothing happens really but still malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting his love for humanity even racist or homophobic people is so overwhelming that you just can't help but also to fall in love with them too br br malle filmed most of it in 1979 he came back 6 years later to see what had changed this would have been a good film without the material 6 years later but this small addition makes it great it may sound like malle was just doing what has been done in the up series but in fact it is not the up series are about people malle's emphasis is not so much on what happened to each person but what has happened to this community and the change is great 1985 is the reagan era and the farmers are suffering once a proud community now no one sees much future at all and parents hope their children will educate them self and do something else than farming br br this documentary is quite relevant today our financial crises today started because of what was happening then just take a look to these final words in the film spoken by an older lawyer from the town in 1985 br br well i have high hopes for this country because the things that are going on right now can only be characterized in my mind as an obsession with greed and a nation doesn't live long with that obsession and particularly a democracy that there's good there's good a lot of good in this country and a lot of good people and they aren't gonna they aren't gonna subscribe to this philosophy of greed that's going on now it's horrible br br unfortunately it took more than 20 years and a hell of a headache before that happened,1
i have seen the movie holes and say that it has to be the best movie all year long it brings out the child in everyone i mean who would come up with the idea of having troublesome boys dig holes as their punishment louis sachar thats who although the movie was different from the book it was still very good for example caveman stanley was supposed to be the biggest one there weight wise and height wise but zigzag ricky was taller and armpit theodore was bigger also x ray rex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys but wasn't the only thing that i didn't like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long i would have rather seen more of the present than past but thats just my opinion i especially like the work of the boys though like squid alan who was played by jake m smith was supposed to be a moody and tough kid jake m smith performed just that and did a great job at it as did almost all of the actors in holes so i would say if you havent seen holes yet then you should definatly see it when it comes out again or you'll be missing out on a whole lotta fun,1
having seen most of ringo lam's films i can say that this is his best film to date and the most unusual it's a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick ass martial arts where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters the action is fantastic the story is tense and entertaining and the set design is truely memorable sadly burning paradise has not been made available on dvd and vhs is next to impossible to get your mitts on even if you near the second biggest china town in north america like i do if you can find it don't pass it up,1
good historical drama which is very educational and also very entertaining to people who like history very good acting and script not as sensual and sexy as it is sometimes marketed be prepared to peek into the pioneer spirit and human ability to adjust very touching as well for the spiritually mature not for people who do not like to think,1
as a producer of indie movies and a harsh critic of such i have to say i loved this movie it is funny and intelligent well directed and entertaining hats off to the producers and directors for making a good one i'll be watching for the next one i gave it a 10,1
the movie has only one flaw unfortunately this flaw damages all credibility of the piece br br it starts with the condemnation of the israeli occupation of disputed territories it fails to address the reason israelis are there egypt syria iraq and jordan attacked israel this is why israel occupys their land because those countries lost it in a war they started br br the film also claims that israel has defied the u n by not complying with resolution 242 problem is 242 was rejected immediately upon it's inception by the palestinians making it void br br many films are put together well and can really show footage that changes minds but remember when watching anything believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see br br all participants in this film are known critics of israel and some have made many antisemitic public comments removing any possible credibility to their words br br all participants are in dire need of a actual history lesson taught objectively not by some palestinian sympathizer,0
i was forced to watch this whole series of films as a young child and i was told they were real talk about child abuse i would have been less frightened of dracula or frankenstein this series is only good for people who believe in this ridiculousness and who want to indoctrinate their children into believing the same besides the obvious issues associated with brainwashing and indoctrination there's also the bad acting bad writing and bad special effects they are just all around terrible terrible movies yes believable and horrifying to a kid but i can't imagine a grown up buying into this shlock although i must say that i would be interested in seeing them today as an adult they might have a certain midnight cult movie feel to them,0
this film takes place in the 1950s according to this the dead called zombies have arisen to eat the living however a company has developed a collar that when put around the zombies neck makes them docile and perfect servants the robinsons mom helen carrie anne moss dad bill dylan baker and son timmy k'sun ray hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one tim names the zombie fido billy connolly and becomes friends with him but his dad hates him and timmy looses control of fido and things go wrong br br as you can see this is among many other things a takeoff on the lassie series with fido being a stand in for lassie timmy was named that for a reason every single of the famous lassie episodes are spun here my favorite is when timmy sends fido off to get help before the zombies eat him also it's a satire of those 1950s douglas sirk films where everything is bright and colorful but dark secrets are tearing people apart the characters wear very bright 1950s clothes moss is always in a dress the furnishings settings and cars especially are all 1950s in hyper bright colors even when the script becomes repetitious there's always something to look at the script is good but there are only so many lassie jokes you can make the melodramatics are kind of silly but the cast pulls it off everyone here is excellent and right on target even connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job moss is the best playing each line for all its worth but never going overboard br br this isn't for everybody of course the satire may be lost on most people and the gore is pretty tame the gore is done so casually and with happy music playing over it it's hard to take it seriously so for some people this will really work i give it an 8,1
in the hands of lesser actors than claudette colbert and robert ryan this film could have become silly and trite but with these two experienced thespians leading the way i found silent fury to be a most exciting and pleasurable little mystery when their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that colbert is already married and that he was best man at that wedding one can sense that there is some sort of plot against her at work as colbert ryan and her attorney set out to disprove the strangers claim of a prior marriage they are met at every turn by more evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is indeed already wed although it's not very difficult to figure out just who the main baddie is it's still lots of fun as the intensity and pace of the story increases all in all a good solid mystery film with fine performances by the two leading actors and a fine supporting cast which includes the often underrated paul kelly,1
this film evil breed the legend of samhain contains very little thought or effort it is ridiculed with specs of ultra fast slasher style death and plain disgusting acts of death the acting was rated a d as the actors show very little ability and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable the way they portrayed what people their ages act like was incredibly different the odd split of porn is fit in thought it really doesn't offer much and any area that is respectable but is quite quickly run down with absolute gut wrenching death example is the poor fellow whom is disemboweled from his anus and the scene lasts for about 5 minutes it is terribly obvious of how little of a fight the kids put up this film is a good choice for someone who likes to watch some awful deaths and practically torture,1
was lucky enough to be an extra in this great film and loved every minute of the filming went to the premier in london and had a great chat to phil peter martin and jon as did my wife fantastic after party too then a few weeks later had trip to the cinema with members of our bike club what a brilliant film it deserves to be up there with all the great biker films now we have the dvd sue my wife can't get enough of it neither can the kids get a bit of stick from the club who seem to think i'm a film star now oh well one can only dream i think they are just jealous the only downside of the first part of the filming was the weather rain rain and more rain but hey we was in wales hopefully there will be a follow up so keep me posted jon danny beck,1
budget limitations time restrictions shooting a script and then cutting it cutting it cutting it this crew is a group of good young filmmakers thoughtful in this script yes allegorical clever in zero dollar effects when time and knowledge is all you have relying on actors and friends and kind others for their time devotion locations and getting a first feature in the can a 1 in 1000 thing these guys make films good ones check out their shorts collection heartland horrors and see the development and i can vouch working with them is about the most fun thing you'll do in the business i'm stymied by harsh insulting criticism for this film wondering if one reviewer even heard one word of dialogue pondered one thought or concept or if all that was desired of this work was the visual gore of bashing and slashing to satisfy some mindless view of what horror should mean to an audience let the empty acre bring itself to you don't preconceive what you expect it should be just because it gets put in the horror thriller genre due to its supernatural premise it's a drama with depth beyond how far you can stick a blade into someone with a reverence for a message that doesn't assault your brain's visual center but rather draws upon one's empathetic imagination to experience other's suffering of mind and spirit mark ridgway curtis the empty acre,1
my wife and i both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made certainly in the top ten of those i've watched all the way through at least plan 9 was enjoyable br br i did really enjoy christine the dead zone firestarter carrie and some of his other films i didn't care much for cujo only because the sound was so bad on versions i've seen and i often couldn't tell what people were saying or pet sematary pet cemetery br br but this mess was a total mistake in every way possible the creatures themselves seemed designed by a 9 year old no offense to 9 year olds br br even the one liners made us groan and weren't remotely amusing,0
i never really watched this program before although it came highly recommended by members of my family funnily enough my girlfriend lives in hadfield the filming location and she pointed out a few landmarks when i first visited br br this got my interest going so i bought the 1st series on video and sat down to watch besides recognising some of the locations i found myself not in the least bit surprised once again the bbc were responsible for producing another example of the finest comedy in the world tlog easily ranks up there with red dwarf fawlty towers and monty python as probably the best br br suffice to say i am hooked on the program now the characters are superb and show unusual depth while retaining a scarily realistic edge the look and feel of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes bleak feeling of the north no disrespect to hadfield which i have found a very welcoming and warm place br br i only hope that it continues its originality throughout its run which based upon the 2nd series which concluded its rerun in the uk last night it certainly is br br well done the bbc,1
despite what the title may imply pigs is pigs does not star porky pig rather it features a young swine with an appetite more insatiable than john belushi's character in animal house his mother repeatedly scolds him but it does no good so much so that he goes to another house where a deranged scientist force feeds him more than any mere mortal can handle but there's a surprise at the end br br i would mostly say that this cartoon seemed like a place holder in between the really great cartoons daffy duck debuted three months after this came out but make no mistake about it they do some neat things here the whole force feeding sequence looks more relevant today given the obesity epidemic overtaking our country br br anyway not the greatest cartoon but worth seeing,1
that's right you heard me i am a huge fan of james patterson i own 10 of his books and i have read the entire series about lindsey boxer in my opinion the screenwriter should be shot br br what right did any film maker have to slaughter a terrific work of fiction and make it into a mockery of the mystery genre if i ever thought that harry potter was butchered then michael o'hara has proved me wrong br br i can only pray that the next screenwriter who tackles this fabulous book will do it a great deal more justice to michael o'hara and russell mulcahy don't quit your day job,0
this should be required viewing for all young people this is documentary at its best from the haunting music and terrific narration by olivier to its unflinching and penetrating analyses the world at war is unforgettable and irreplaceable for anyone who wants to know about humanity's sorry experience at the nadir of the 20th century,1
with the death of george nader on 4 february 2002 i thought of this most interesting program which even though it had only a short run was a tremendous idea with good story lines throughout generally unseen for over 40 years it would be worth viewing again the opening credits showed many differing images one of which was a snippit of colonel john paul stapp riding his famed rocket sled at the point where he was often referred to as the fastest man alive,1
i thoroughly enjoyed this flick i am of the firm belief that matt stone and trey parker are comic geniuses of our time they have the uncanny ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it rediculous but in a realistic way if that makes any sense this is mainly what makes south park soooo funny once you get past the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet cartoon ever you see in every episode the message that is being conveyed that is apparent in baseketball although it is directed by david zucker and is utterly rediculous it has a sincere message about corporate america and the disgrace that is major league sports i am also a fan of sports so i find this movie hilarious at times because it is so true in that bizarre way that people hate to love the opening prologue is brilliant tears from laughter form everytime i see those football players begin riverdance some may not like this movie because it's just not everyone's cup of tea but just like south park once you look past the absurdity it has a really genuine message that is conveyed through literal comic genius i gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars,1
in this movie joe pesci slams dunks a basketball joe pesci br br and being consistent the rest of the script is equally not believable br br pesci is a funny guy which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar but the other roles were pretty bad the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people which wasn't even well played instead of the man being an archetypal villain he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs then there's the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something i don't even remember she was that forgettable br br anyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this sunken film or at least one of those millions of media minions who can't critique efficiently you know the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6 br br stay away far away and shame on comedy central where i saw this film they usually pick better,0
if only to avoid making this type of film in the future this film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story br br one might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many important issues but it does so without any discernable motive the viewer comes away with no new perspectives unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders as it will invariably do during this pointless film br br one might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing br br,0
i've discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging the zombie on the front of the dvd looks cool and scary then you get to the movie and it's women with raccoon masks on zero special effects and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet the funny thing is that lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie the only thing i can think is that lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a cult classic however i can't possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made the real horror in this film is how bad it is i'm embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another lommel film again,0
i saw this movie being a jane austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels well this transposition is simply accurate intelligent delicate careful tactful respectful intense in a word perfect br br emma is one of austen's most delightful and funny novels thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters the movie respected this subtle irony not disregarding the comic element miss bates above all what engaged me in the novel and the movie renders it clearly is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the english novelist and the modern look with which women men and their relation are handled and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the 18th century who lived almost a secluded life could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did that most and still fascinates me we can feel this modernity throughout the movie just replace costumes and use a more current language but the situations the feelings the ideas would be extremely modern i think of the morbid interest in other people's lives or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women's relations and still the difficulty in revealing and giving expression to one's feelings especially love every situation gets a universal and out of time value br br the cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances a young gwyneth paltrow is particularly suitable for this role nowadays she would be probably too mature for it toni colette is simply great and how i envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear and then the breathtaking english countryside where every situation gets such a magic and dream like dimension a really enjoyable and deserving movie,1
la maman et la putain has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released post 68 and eternal in many respects true the actors don't act true they talk a lot but what they talk about is just what makes life worth living or dying the very long monologue spoken by françoise lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about womanhood manhood and love not easy to translate accurately though this movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman or two women in this case and imho jean pierre léaud is one of the greatest french actors,1
the man in the moon is a beautifully realistic look at life through the eyes of an adolescent director robert mulligan magically re creates screenwriter jenny wingfield's autobiography of her childhood with gorgeous cinematography and a haunting lyrical musical score this film hits home as one of the most powerful and emotionally affecting films in recent times br br this film is incredible all the acting first rate especially sam waterston and an astonishing performance by reese witherspoon in her film debut you will feel every emotion as this life changing summer in 1957 on the trant family farm comes to a conclusion br br the man in the moon was a limited release in 1991 and you will love the fact that most of you're family and friends will probably have never heard of it buy this dvd and enjoy 100 minutes of pure poetic art this film is truely the essence of filmaking at its finest,1
more directors like nacho vigalondo need a greater outlet for their talents 7 35 de la mañana is absolute genius what nacho is able to convey in 8 minutes takes some hollywood directors hours of film to achieve i watched this smiling but feeling a little dirty and not in the sexual way you sit and wonder how you should feel after watching this 8 min nugget i was entertained but was disturbed at the same time not many people can do that in just 8 minutes it starts off simple enough a young women comes in for breakfast at her usual place she sits down and someone starts singing from there the film takes you through so many different emotions all at once it is hard to describe it is in black white but this helps with the feeling the film gives you this film makes you want to know more about the characters how they interacted previously and how the ending impacted their lives afterward i guess it like the old saying leave them wanting more nacho vigalondo is able to do that watch this when you can show it to your friends and wonder how 8 minutes can be so much fun without taking off your clothes,1
the original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the tv series because most people watch for the 1930s style ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the underground can play at that game too hanging the storyline on a plot about the jarrow march was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so i suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing all the stuff about japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time this would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show it is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content,0
working with one of the best shakespeare sources this film manages to be creditable to it's source whilst still appealing to a wider audience br br branagh steals the film from under fishburne's nose and there's a talented cast on good form,0
this is the second animatrix short and the first of them to be what one could call 'artistic' it contains a lot of references metaphors and symbols in the dense amount of material especially with a running time of 9 minutes i've heard some complaints that this is anti human or tries to direct hate towards man for their sins against machine i don't think that's true it merely uses the robots to show us that as humans we aren't particularly accepting or open minded towards anyone different from ourselves i'd say it does a great job of that the plot is good it plays as a historical document recounting what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy thus it holds clips from fictional news reports and the like the voice acting is very good if there is not a lot of it the animation is nice and the use of color in spite of the usually realistic drawing style makes it more open to do the smooth transitions and other surreal imagery this has several bits of strong violence and disturbing visuals as well as a little nudity the disc holds a commentary not in english but subtitled and worth a listen read there is also a well done and informative making of based on both parts so i would advise watching it after seeing the next one as well i recommend this to anyone who enjoys the matrix universe and or science fiction in general 8 10,1
nora is a single mother of two who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s as do her friends a group of writers singers and actors the free love' philosophy isn't quite out of the system  and nora didn't count on falling in love particularly with a junkie hazlehurst won her first of two afi awards in the space of four years for her amazing portrayal of nora who makes sure she does the right thing by her children but falls in love with junkie javo friels at the same time garner  who would later costar in films such as love and other catastrophes and strange planet  is well cast as nora's pre pubescent daughter and caton perhaps in readiness for his role as host of the lifestyle program hot property in 2000 appears as a bearded painter early effort by director cameron is a winner he went on to make the award winning miniseries my brother jack among his later projects but it's the stunning delivery by hazlehurst which brings to life the intelligent searching script based on helen garner's award winning novel,1
this film is overblown predictable pretentious and hollow to its core the settings are faithful to the era but self conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure the lingering over artifacts stops the action and cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue tom hanks seems to be sleepwalking much as bruce willis did in hart's war tom you can't give depth to a character simply by making your face blank the content did not warrant the histrionic acting by paul newman this is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing,0
please don't waste your time this movie rehashes the worst of bram stoker's dracula van helsing anne rice's vampire lestat rock music and silly biblical references and blade high tech toys i really like vampire movies and novels and there are many out there that are very good but not this stinker not even the soundtrack helps it mostly because the movie resorts to ridiculous scary classical music rather than the kick ass metal some reported only a few times did i hear any metal mostly it was tortured violins avoid it like garlic and crucifixes,0
i first saw breaking glass in 1980 and thought that it would be one of the movie classics this film is a great look into the music industry with a great cast of performers this is one film that should be in the collection of everyone and any one that wants to get into the music industry i can't wait for it to be available on dvd,1
this film is a great example of fine storytelling the acting is superb the story is inspiring without being overly manipulative or fake there were a couple points where they probably made people a tad more good or bad than they really were but considering it is a hollywood movie they showed amazing restraint there wasn't a single explosion shown in the movie even though they had one opportunity to the film while having suspenseful parts was not made into an action movie the story is thus made to focus on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary times well done,1
after watching this i thought to myself there are either too few good writers directors or lots of producers br br at any rate this is a terrible movie terrible in a way that it's not fun but rather makes you grit your teeth and quiver makes you shout this is wrong at the movie immersion is zero by now most of you are probably used to the terrible errors weirdness es in movies that has computers hackers etc in them this movie is like that in every aspect br br the only good thing about the movie is the little girl emily brilliantly played by eliza bennett i hope she becomes big and make this thing at least worth something br br do yourself a favor don't watch this there is not even proper action in it total waste of time,0
despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in new zealand any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved apart from a clichés only plot the movie is let down by some weak acting accents and overall lack of tension br br whilst having the overall look of a big budget for nz the feel is decidedly small town kiwi br br has anyone not seen the brothers http imdb com title tt0250274 those who have will pick the similarities straightaway i've heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clichéd boys talking crap but it comes across as forced br br i believe oscar keightley sees himself as deeply ironic but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious br br those who have any doubts left at all that samoans living in nz culture has been deeply hopefully not permanently affected by american speech culture and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie br br robbie magasiva always looks good on screen but is let down by the script br br it always rubs me up the wrong way when a comedy has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clichéd punchline see the wanna be white boy br br i know someone who found this movie hilarious however that person has the brains of a tadpole and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars br br that kinda sums up the mentality of this flick ok but not great fun but not funny wake up nz this is not a 5 star movie despite all the glowing middle class white guilt reviews br br my advice if you watch it get drunk first,0
this is a low budget spoof of the espionage genre to help frame your expectations you should know that 1 the acting is wildly heavy handed the stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement frequent hand gestures and off key pacing 2 the script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility oftentimes lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plot elements 3 shots are frequently framed in off balance angles poking fun at genre excesses 4 a pop eyed jeff goldblum delivers complex and classically preposterous dialog in a winningly sarcastic manner br br the film has a guiding intelligence deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from the b films of the 1930's a secret code with a structure that would defy explanation by carl sagan the film's over the top acting is used mostly for comic effect during the first 90 minutes in an early running gag fay grim's son ned is so frequently told to leave that you can't help chuckling while feeling sorry for the lad parker posey's nicely choreographed fall from bed also helps set a humorous tone early in the film br br the film's slow pacing does not enhance the comedy elements or the drama elements that later emerge the film's impact as drama is significantly lessened by the early comedy moreover it is hard to be overly involved with the characters and their fates when the early portions of the film are so sarcastic the musical score is intentionally heavy handed and i found this and the off kilter camera angles more irritating than humorous br br the over the top acting the implausible and nearly incomprehensible plot of conspiracies counter conspiracies and the slow pacing will grind on many viewers the movie is much too long at 158 minutes br br that said fans who are receptive to the film's sarcasm might want to watch again using closed captioning to best catch the intelligent ridiculousness of the dialog the film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more heavy handed than light hearted but the comedy may well appeal to your tastes the film is worth a view for those who enjoy independent films fans of director hal harley or devotees of parker posey who has the most camera time,0
this is a sprawling 4 hours remake of the rider haggard story with the usual added female and an extraneous subplot with russian soldiers seeking a stone of power buried along with the treasure of king solomon it's very well shot giving a vivid sense of the wide open spaces of africa and very well acted patrick swayze is an excellent alan quatermain and allison doody is attractive as elizabeth maitland who hires quatermain to help rescue her father sidede onyulo as umbopa gavin hood as mcnabb and the leader of the russian soldiers not named in imdb's listing are also memorable for all that hollywood can't leave a good story alone when they adapt it this one is well told and except that it's too long i enjoyed it 6 10,1
this movie was one of the best disney movies i've ever seen great for the entire family to watch the ideas may be a little far fetched but it's a feel good comedy and the acting is great love the little boy j p and academy award winner adrien brody's part may have been very short but very memorable highly recommended,1
good grief while i still maintain that manos the hands of fate is the worst piece of mental torture available hobgoblins came awfully close this this thing insults the audience at every opportunity br br at least films like space mutiny and future war can be enjoyed on mst3k this one was a struggle to get through i was literally writhing on the couch in anguish this thing managed to embarrass me alone br br even if you are a die hard mst3k fan and have made it your mission to see every single experiment think twice about seeing this one br br it's that bad,0
this film was in one word amazing i have only seen it twice and have been hunting it everywhere a beautiful ensemble of older screen gems who still have that energy judy denchs ability to carry the whole film was amazing her subtle chemistry with the knight in stolen armour was great,1
maiden voyage is just that i'd like to say straight away that i watched 5mins of this before i just couldn't stand it anymore as already stated in another comment this film doesn't fall into the whole so bad it's good thing it's just bad the acting is awful the sfx are poor and the story is bland and stupid even the extras suck the bag guy guards and such appear to hold their weapons like water pistols br br don't even bother watching this film the only thing special about it is that no matter how low your expectations are you will still be disappointed,0
this horrendously bad piece of trash manages to be racist sexist and homophobic all at once while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated atrocious performances a cliche ridden screenplay and boring direction make this movie one to steer clear of two scenes were especially offensive the one in which schaech scrubs his tongue after being kissed by another man could it really have been that gross and the scene where eastwood is kissed by schaech's best friend who is pretending to be russian after he leaves the room she exclaims f king foreigners so much for her being a cultured artist who dreams of living in paris br br jonathon schaech can be a likeable actor on screen and is astonishingly good looking it's a shame he didn't learn more from working with cutting edge gay director gregg araki on an earlier film and try to salvage this film from descending into a string of gay stereotypes and a mire of homophobia,0
the turning point in the matador comes about half through the movie when danny an unsophisticated man from denver is sitting in the balcony of his mexico city hotel enjoying a quiet moment someone knocks on his door and knowing it's julian the paid assassin he refuses to answer but did he really br br richard shephard the director of the matador presents us with a character julian noble who shows no redeemable qualities in fact we have already seen him in action doing what he does best when julian meets danny at the bar of the camino real in mexico city he spills the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does for a living br br danny who has come to sell his program to a mexican company but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract danny is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter julian it's not until some time later on a cold winter night that the killer appears at danny's door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to tucson it's at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way br br pierce brosnan acting against type makes a great contribution with his irreverent julian noble just to watch him walking through the hotel lobby in his speedo and boots gives the right impression about his character greg kinnear on the other hand plays the straight part of this odd couple hope davis appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to lament why didn't she stay longer philip baker hall puts an appearance as the liaison between julian and his assignments br br richard shephard directs with style working with his own material the musical score is by rolfe kent and the crisp cinematography of david tattersall enhances everything,1
this film turned up on local tv here in south africa recently and i thought that i'd warn even those who enjoy watching b grade bad movies which i do that this is not even amusing the plot concerns a couple visiting a house in the country some strangers appear and the problem is that most of the film obviously shot in the early seventies consists of extreme wide shots of people walking in real time and awfully slowly from a to b this makes the film tedious in the extreme and the expected blood and gore payoff just never happens i am really curious how many people have actually watched this from beginning to end,0
where the sidewalk ends is quite a good film noir crime drama and is shot well in black and white and on location as well br br a copper accidentally kills a bloke who is suspected of murder and to protect himself he covers this up and blames it on another person he doesn't like who has committed a lot of crimes in the past but towards the end he owns up but not before falling in love with a woman he meets who is the lover of the person he killed br br the cast includes dana andrews while the city sleeps curse of the demon gene tierney laura the ghost and mrs muir gary merrill mysterious island karl malden the streets of san francisco beyond the posidon adventure and craig stevens the deadly mantis good parts from all br br where the sidewalk ends is worth checking out if you get the chance excellent br br rating 3 stars out of 5,1
leonard maltin compared this film to a mel brooks comedy he was far too kind to ms rivers and far too cruel to mr brooks not even the raunchiest mel brooks films are this tasteless and at least they're genuinely funny this picture deserves a place on the hundred worst list,0
the buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make kevin bacon disappear sadly they stopped there they should have continued to make the script disappear then the silly set and finally every visible element of this film because there's nothing else there to show br br gary thompson and andrew marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film i don't really think they exist i think they bought this script at scripts r us where you buy a standard blank monster movie script and just fill in the blanks there's a monster stalking us let's split up they actually let's split up in this movie hit alien giant bug monster invisible man with crowbar not dead yet burn huge rabbit shark invisible man in unsurvivable fire not dead yet you know the standard stuff even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie ir glasses spraying with something like paint were handled badly br br what is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie they psychological issues for the subject the deterioration of the mind due to the process treating an invisible subject and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting had there been any desire to save kevin bacon in the end it would have been a much better movie all in all it stunk br br i would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie but i don't want to do any spoilers suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they don't think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than,0
this review may have spoilers but that determination would be negligible in such a classic and well known story br br the cinderella story ranks as my favorite fairy tale the world will never have enough of this wonderful tale br br the problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale this cannot work if the story deviates or attempts to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photography and scrumptious looking production designs with poor direction and editing br br this cinderella story is more like an ugly duckling that never hatches or rather is never transformed into a swan br br all the production value that money can buy cannot purchase good cinematic timing and dramatic development or good acting br br the entrance of cinderella at the ball as so poorly done there was no drama of anticipation nor excitement of discovery br br the writing made me very nervous too the prince charming was the most undesirable of memory why would any girl want to marry a boorish self absorbed prince who disliked women br br turner's turn on the stepmother role was an embarrassingly painful showing that demonstrated one liners more than acting nuance br br even the cinderella part held little interest or sympathy br br perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt so cheaply '90's br br what must be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is the glorious photography matte work and production design it was a pleasure to peruse the landscapes sets and settings as the story unfolded br br for some cinderella storytelling go for two gems br br 1 rodgers and hammerstein's cinderella musical with lesley ann warren even with the obvious stagey tv 60's look to the sets this is the best version on celluloid bar none an all star cast makes every effort to provide the highest entertainment engaging diverting and memorable writing and music this is the classic br br 2 ever after this drew barrymore gem maintains the historical perspective alters the story line but not enough to derail the effective development of the salient points of this classic tale the characters of the principals and of all of the supporting roles were written smartly and acted well,0
this movie probably never made a blip on the radar screen but it's got quite a bit of quality it's pretty lifelike yet you think it's only a movie duvall and close portray common people and you'd never even realize they are now big name actors it seems that the jerk in this story is a little too old to be chasing eugene's girlfriend but i guess it's possible it seems unlikely that the kid would travel from montana to nevada by himself but i guess it's possible you might think that the family troubles in this movie would never happen in your own family but i guess it's possible i remember glenn close saying something like you think the work you do is the hardest part of your life but it isn't,1
demi moore's character in the movie was selected for the seals because of her looks that was a bad start and the movie went down from there the plot was totally unbelievable the will to make it in a tough military unit is not enough this movie did not convince me of a woman's physical ability to perform the types of tasks required br br trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence the differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting,0
i first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick snuff i was told that devil's experiment was much better so naturally i went ahead and ordered the guinea pig box set i was really interested to hear that charlie sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one so my interest was peaked br br devil's experiment is a short film with no story no character development just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes they torture her in various ways like beating her spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol forcing her to listen to hi pitched noise for 24 hours smash her hand with a mallet burning and putting maggots on the burns throwing guts at her and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye br br i must say that a lot of this movie was fake like the beating scenes but then some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out the scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about the worst is the eye scene i didn't shutter when watching it but simply thought damn that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie i did enjoy the flick but i don't know if i can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer 7 10,1
i used to love this movie as a kid but seeing it again 20 years later it actually sucks up the academy might have been ahead of it's time back in 1980 but it has almost nothing to offer today movies like caddyshack and stripes hold up much better today than this steaming dogpile no t a no great jokes except for the one liners we've all heard a million times by now br br i recently bought the dvd in hopes that it would be the gem i remembered it being well i was way off the soundtrack had only 2 3 widely recognizable hits not the smash compilation others had mentioned and the frequent voice overs were terrible the only thing that was interesting to me was predicting what the character's lines were before they said them yep i watched this movie that much back then br br the only reason i am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten sorry to say,0
have you heard the story about the reluctant heroes who were hired by a king to slay a dragon oh you have was it set in a world entirely composed of small islands floating above clouds and did the heroes have to make dangerous leaps from one island to the next on their journey did water flow upwards and remnants of great cities levitate on the horizon i didn't think so br br i stumbled onto this movie by accident and i'm really glad that i did it's one of the most beautiful movies i've ever seen much like the pixar movies it's a piece of computer animated art that could only be possible in today's world the animators have invested thought into almost everything that appears on the screen and this attention to detail is staggering the scene where the mushrooms in the foreground belch green smoke whilst the characters walk obliviously in the background is one of my favourites the monsters are also fully realised and wonderful to watch in action br br although the plot may not be entirely unique the movie has enough charm to make sure you keep watching our protagonists are likable and interesting ensuring the audience is behind their almost impossible quest to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon which might otherwise devour everything in its path of course hector is the character most will fall in love with a small blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and english hector provides comedy relief in a way jar jar binks could only dream of br br in summary i'd recommend watching the dragon hunters if you get the opportunity watch it for the incredible animation the breath taking battle scenes and for a glimpse into a world that's unlike anything else you've seen on a cinema or television screen at the very least it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half no matter if you're nine or twenty nine which in fact i am,1
save your money i have been a fan of fullmoon productions for a long time and i have never seen them make a movie as bad as this the casting is terrible the story is even worse and the special affects are worse than any movie iv'e seen sence the 80's this movie is so bad i cant even suggest renting it,0
david lynch's crude and crudely drawn take on south park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clichés about suburban middle class families the father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouth hole from which are uttered the most horrendous guttural noises the son and mother are permanently horrified incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life a number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series br br lynch is not famous for his comedies i e on the air aspects of wild at heart and i am not particularly fond of comedies in general however there were a couple of scenes in dumbland which made me laugh out loud there are some clever bits of animated cinematography where lynch conveys wide ranges of reaction in his characters through a syntactical arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions which never really vary in dumbland br br i believe lynch was really trying to give his audience a straight forward if disturbing animated comedy here interestingly he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra low brow humor i e most will farrell films while adding elements of vicious social critique and classic cartoon violence and gross out humor while the blend doesn't really work very well here it is nothing if not lynchian br br worth seeing by lynch fans,0
this is a good movie although people unfamiliar with the modesty blaise comics and books may find it a little slow and lacking in action for the modesty fan the movie will be very enjoyable particularly because it is very faithful in its presentation of the modesty blaise history peter o'donnell is listed in the credits as creative consultant and the film makers must have actually paid attention to him as the plot follows quite closely the details that have been presented in the comic books over the years although the events have been recast to modern days the only thing that the true fan may find disappointing is that there is no willie garvin in the story this lack of willie is again just being faithful to the modesty blaise chronology since the movie takes place in the very early days of modesty's career alexandra staden makes a very believable young modesty who actually looks a lot like modesty is supposed to look a welcome change from the travesty of the monica vitti portrayal of modesty,1
this film is the worst film but it ranks very high for me it is how a slasher movie should be it takes place at a university in which there only seems to be a handful of students the teachers are dumber than a sack of hammers it is filled with good catholic priest sexually repressed humor bad hair bad clothes the dialogue is so cliched it is hard to believe that i was able to predict lines in quotes the slashings have some creativity and seem to revolve around stabbing people in the genitalia a lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve to die because they are so bad i recommend this film for a fun time get a case of cheap beer and some friends watch it and laugh,0
mr perlman gives a standout performance as usual sadly he has to struggle with an underwritten script and some nonsensical set pieces br br larsen is in die hard mode complete with singlet and bulging muscles i'm sure he could do better but seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his part br br the lovely erika is very decorative even though fully clothed and shows some signs of getting acting at last br br sfx are mainly poor cgi and steals from other movies br br the shootouts are pitiful worthy of the a team br br not even worth seeing for perlman avoid,0
i sat through this at gencon only because it was quiet and i could nap what a waste of time beverly d'angelo and william katt wtf were the lady who played flo and abe vigoda busy or something br br truly a piece of unfunny garbage the characters were stereotypical without meaning to i think and wooden most of them seemed like they were on autopilot the so called hilarious situations described in some of the other so called reviews were so hackneyed i weeped for the writers br br i'm confused as to how anyone can find this worth their time seriously i'm only giving it 3 out of 10 because in order to be a 2 or 1 it would need to be either five hours long or feature more kelly lebrock,0
'the luzhin defence' is a movie worthy of anyone's time it is a brooding intense film and kept my attention the entire time john turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender eccentric chess grandmaster and emily watson is spell binding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected russian family the chemistry between watson and turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story all in all this movie is one of the best in depth looks at the life of a chess grandmaster and turturro and watson add a whole non mainstream non cliche feel to the film most people will come out of the theater thinking and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories,1
bette midler is again divine raunchily humorous in love with burlesque capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power punch than ever all in all singing new ballads power singing the good old perennial ones such as the rose stay with me and yes even wind beneath my wings the best way to appreciate the divine miss m has always been libe since this is the next best thing to it i strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries,1
after all you do not go to an orson welles movie to see a nice simple little plot and a burnishing of the image of a happy ever after star br br you go to see theatrically heightened characters locked in conflict against colorful and unusual settings lighted and scored imaginatively photographed bravely and the whole thing peppered with unexpected details of surprise that a wiser and duller director would either avoid or not think of in the first place br br as usual as well as directing welles wrote the script and he also played the hero  a young irish seaman who had knocked about the world and seen its evil but still retained his clear eyed trust in the goodness of others unfortunately for him he reposed this trust in rita hayworth whose cool good looks concealed a gloomy past and murderous inclinations for the future she was married without love to an impotent crippled advocate acted like a malevolent lizard by the brilliant everett sloane br br there is a youthful romanticism underlying it all and this quality came into exuberant play in the lady from shanghai before the inevitable happened welles escaped  to a final triangular showdown in a hall of mirrors which has become one of the classic scenes of the post war cinema  br br welles did not miss a chance throughout the whole film to counterpoint the words and actions with visual detail which enriched the texture and heightened the atmosphere his camera seemed almost to caress rita hayworth as the sun played with her hair and her long limbs while she playfully teased the young seaman into her web,1
tony scott directs a thriller sports flick that should attract even the non sports fan and some say baseball is a dead sport boring too damn slow well perk up on the outside he appears to be a disgruntled salesman robert de niro while on the inside he is a psychotic san francisco giants fan along comes a new slugger wesley snipes and designated savior from the doldrums our salesman harbors a murderous obsession when the hard hitting all star falls into the worst slump in his career and the giants are feared to crumble along with him de niro is terror personified snipes seems very natural as the ballplayer other notables in the cast are the still attractive ellen barkin john leguizamo benicio del toro and patti d'arbanville you are a free agent so enjoy violence and very strong language is to be expected and you get your moneys worth,0
good films cannot solely be based on a beautiful garden and a hill top surprised to see it has won two awards extremely overrated i first saw that kind of films from china visually stunning but also with really something captivating to say well more than 10 years ago and i'm sure there are still more coming up this is not one of them i'm afraid,0
boy this movie had me fooled i honestly thought it would be a campy horror film with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever boy i got the cold shoulder that time this movie was and i'm truthful pretty damn good it was not scary at all but the campiness and the sly humor really mad this movie interesting some to the horrible acting and cliché killings were so painful to watch i almost laughed at how bad it was but to some extent i enjoyed it the killings all vaguely relate to snow sports and christmas which made things more intriguing the pov camera angles were awesome br br the movie is about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident collision with a chemical truck while being transported to prison he is later resurrected in that very same chemical with snow spliced into the mixture these were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman he than takes his revenge as the snowman on the police officer who convicted him br br this movie had such bad acting with the exception of christopher allport that is was funny i will say that i am also pretty disappointed that this movie was not a horror but in fact a dark sitcom they had a great story with a good plot but it wasn't executed right all in all i like the movie at first but now it is really annoying but this movie is way better and darker than the sequel,0
fido is to be commended for taking a tired genre zombies and turning it into a most original film experience the early 50s atmosphere is stunning the acting terrific and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars eisenhower era dress art deco furniture and zombie servants it would be very easy to dismiss fido as cartoon like fluff similar to tank girl but the two movies are vastly different fido has structure a script that tells a story and acting that is superior make no mistake this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed highly recommended merk,1

one of the most provocative films ever with excellent cinematography backed up by mc clarens lisp and stunning quote do you believe in love at first site br br a trace of expressionism was evident in this picture further catapulting the films flawless integrity gabby aka joey played by eva longoria clearly loved the movie and role she played so much that she couldn't even be bothered giving it mention in her filmography lol br br the best part of the movie would have to be without a doubt the heroic rescue by mc clure as he saved the young 'handicapped' kid with the speech impediment which i may add was acted to perfection james cahiil's use of sound effects is unmatched even to this day the drug bust he performs early in the film is pain stakingly realistic when i watched this movie for the first time i was so compelled with the intense lack of respect for the gang inthused brothers from the southside gang and the ctm cut throat mafia this was by far one of the most encapsulating crevice cahill has committed to filming br br personally this film holds sentimental value to me and i will be downloading it in the near future thats if i can find it anywhere lol,1
well how was i suppose to know this was the dumb ass promotional lordi motion picture i mean i realized this when that dinosaur costume showed up and by the time the lead singer made his appearance i was humming hard rock hallelujah to myself even though i hate that song dark floors is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of being sneaked out of the hospital by her over protective father when they and the rest of the people in that particular elevator become momentarily trapped when they arrive at their floor it comes as quite a surprise to find that there is nobody else around the hospital is empty except for a variety of monsters that seem to be stalking them for no apparent reason they run through the hallways and stairwells encountering all of the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish shock rock costumes nothing really memorable here except the lousy acting lack of gore nudity and the utterly shameless promotional edge reminding me very much of kiss meet the phantom of the park yeah remember that dud wish i didn't i would just recommend avoiding all of these ghost house films like a fungus and not listen to lordi since they are a gwar ripoff band,0
having seen versus previously i had high hopes for alive the description of the movie on the back of the dvd jacket sounded promising alive did not deliver very slow development loads of potential with the cast and the cool visuals the premise was intriguing but the payoff did not offset the build up could have done so much more at the end most of the movie is just sitting around to put it plainly three of us were amped to sit down and watch this movie and by the 50 minute mark we were struggling to make it thru to the end it really needed more shock elements if you are looking for ichi the killer or versus type fights then save yourself some and loads of disappointment,0
here we go with other slasher movie good looking people and acting from everyone was really good br br few kids playing pranks phones calls and there parents are killed by the killer in front of the kids 20 years after they are still friends they go to huge house have fun drugs and sex no nudity for least half a hour of the movie again they start making pranks phone call all over again and then killer comes back kills them off one by one and killer is in big black coat with axe just like urban legend movie br br deaths scene really weird really odd times too br br nice slasher movie at this part would gave 7 10 but the twist at the end of the movie made the whole movie kinda of pointless br br the twist killed the movie for me so i going to give it 4 10,0
a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film also a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original i'm tired of the same old stuff in movies a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film also a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original i'm tired of the same old stuff in movies a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film also a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original i'm tired of the same old stuff in movies,1
i remember back when i was little when i was away at camp and we would campout under the stars there was always someone there that would have a good story to tell that involved the woods that surrounded us and they would always creep me out well when i found wendigo at the library i checked it out hoping to be one of those films that had a supernatural being haunting people in the woods much like the stories that were told at camp well much to my dismay i was so far from the truth wendigo is really bad the story starts of when a family of three is driving to their winter cabin which looks like your normal suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods and they run into a deer well it seems the local rednecks were actually hunting this particular deer and are pretty upset at our city folk the movie spends far too much time following the families everyday activities instead of getting to the point of the film it wasn't until about the last 15 minutes that we actually have some action involving the wendigo my suggestion is that you stay very far away this film it will leave you wanting your hour and a half back,0
the animation was fab and the film funny the two circus bugs tuck roll were very funny if you waited till the credits at the end you saw a very funny sequence of film where they showed the bugs pretending to do things wrong like in other movies that was clever as it made the characters more human and beliveable,1
okay i'll admit it i am a goof ball and i occasionally love a really silly comedy while i have seen more films by kurosawa bergman and truffaut than practically anyone on the planet i still have a soft spot for a dopey comedy that doesn't try to be sophisticated but is simply funny a few such films that immediately come to mind are monty python and the holy grail uhf start the revolution without me strange brew and the bill and ted movies they all lack snob appeal but only a zombie or professional film critic could dislike them br br while bill ted's bogus journey isn't as wonderful as the original bill and ted film it still is great fun also unlike the original it actually seems to improve with repeated viewing i remember not loving the film the first time i saw it possibly because the other movie set such a high standard for laughs but every time i see it again i am amazed at all the great moments particularly those involving the grim reaper and by the way this reaper is about as different from bergman's in the seventh seal as you can get in addition to a lot of laughs this film features some excellent music one way that it's actually better than the first film the kiss anthem at the end is great but so are the rest of the hard rock tunes provided you aren't an old killjoy like de nomolos great viewing for kids and adults alike,1
loved the film this was my first glimpse at both reese witherspoon and jason london both of which are two of my favorites must say that no matter how many times i've seen this movie i can't help but tear up one of those movies that should become a classic for all,1
this two parter was excellent the best since the series returned sure bits of the story were pinched from previous films but what tv shows don't do that these days what we got here was a cracking good sci fi story a great big really scary monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit some superb aliens in the ood the best new aliens the revived series has come up with a set of basically sympathetic and believable human characters complete with a couple of unnamed expendable security people in true star trek fashion some large scale philosophical themes love loyalty faith etc and some top drawer special effects br br i loved every minute of this,1
i may be getting ahead of myself here but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time i watched it piece by piece on tcm last night the question arises to me why did they do that putting their lives in jeopardy many of them died on the trek why would they undertake such a life endangering journey just to find food for their animals once they reached the land of milk and honey why didn't they just stay there would you endanger your life and that of your entire community just to find food for a herd of cattle as dangerous as it was to do it for that purpose alone shows the inbred simplicity of these types of people risk death for a cow better them than i,1
but i want to say i cannot agree more with moira br br what a wonderful film br br i was thinking about it just this morning wanting to give advice to some dopey sod who'd lost money on his debit card through fraud and wanted to say 'keep thy money in thine pocket' and realised i was talking like james mason br br even tho he didn't say those words i still think he would i've never forgotten 'are ye carrying ' in his reconciliation with his son hywel bennet 'always have money in thine pocket ' good advice br br not enough kids have fathers with such unforgiving but well meant attitudes any more or any father at all br br it would be a good thing for us to reinstate 'thee' 'thy' and 'thine' in our language to show we care it is only the same as 'tutoyer' in french or 'du' in german br br addendum i just realised that a lot of my remarks were about james mason in the family way br br i think it's because i mixed up susan george with hayley mills well easy mistake br br i stand by the comments tho' br br and spring and port wine is so very similar to the family way br br when you took a girlfriend to the pictures in those days you really had something to say and talk about afterwards something that affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development br br theatrical experiences are almost real and they are important in helping young people to grow up br br it doesn't happen now i think that teenagers can just go to the pics like we did,1
one of the last classics of the french new wave for direction cineaste jean eustache drew from the simplicity of early century cinema for story eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life so many things can be said of this film observationally brilliant self indulgently overlong occasionally hilarious emotionally draining etc etc in my mind whatever complaints that can be leveled against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths every film student writer or simply anyone willing to handle a 3 hour film with no abrupt cuts no music video overstyling no soap opera like plot twists and no banal dialogue should make it a point to see this movie everything is to be admired the writing concise clever surprisingly funny acting everyone quite simply is perfect in their respective roles and simple direction the viewer feels like a casual observer within the film make this film unforgettable this is undoubtedly a film that stays with you,1
revolt of the zombies has no redeeming features i'm tired of people arguing that it's not that bad and that the effects must have packed more of a punch in 1936 i suspect this isn't true it's not like iq's have risen sharply in the last 7 decades the average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored by this rubbish as the average viewer today why just try watching the first scenes and count the pauses between things happening the awful choice of when to cut to close up the slapdash editing that seems to include an extra two seconds on every shot to pad out the running time pay attention to the utterly redundant dialogue i'm going to make some tea go outside read my book now are you yes i am that sort of exchange happens several times normally i would love that being a huge fan of bad movies but watch the listless actors mumbling their trite and tedious lines and all desire to laugh at the movie slowly fades away this sort of disinterested pot boiling time waster is far worse than energetic imaginative mind blowers like plan nine from outer space or santa claus conquers the martians those who claim that this is better than those more interesting movies have a backwards idea of entertainment this movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw hangs open in astonishment it's bad in the sense that your eyes slowly close in boredom which is far worse,0
but the keyword here is usually i have been known to adore movies everyone thinks are dumb but in the world of b rated movies this one is z rated absolutely ridiculous the thing i respect about most of my favorite b rated movies are that they don't take themselves too seriously the makers of movies like that sort of treat the movie lightly even if it's a heavy topic i get the impression however that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously like they were putting together a 10 star classic complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots nevertheless despite all this i still gave it 4 out of 10 stars as i am biased towards movies like this if you're a b rated fan however i would try too hard to find this one,0
great battle finale and nice sets help keep this often slow movie enjoyable at times it had me checking my watch although there were enough memorable moments to make the film stand out in my mind days after watching it the ending should surprise even those familiar with the nibelungen story line,1
i remember seeing this years ago when it first came out and i was floored by parker posey's performance and the movie was pretty good also for anyone who's spent a little too much time in the nightclub after hours scene this movie will have a special charm for you not too serious mostly funny and parker posey definitely blazes her talented way through this indie gem br br i especially liked the diaz character reminded me of every single struggling dj i've ever known and many other movies could take a cue from this movie on how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and bland about it br br babaganoosh,1
1985 was a good year for films maybe even great but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol' oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members br br 11 nominations and not a single title such was the academy's disdain for one of their greatest directors and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for schindler's list which is arguably not as good and i'm half polish br br don't get me wrong schindler was a classic and i'm not knocking 'out of africa' which won that year either but it was in my mind a class behind this one an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears and i'm not a big cryer br br maybe it was the music superb or the cinematography sumptuous but more likely simply the acting whoopi who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne danny glover who i'd never heard of before and of course oprah br br the rest is history but at the time who knew,1
will smith is one of the best actors of all time i don't know how he does it i read books constantly but if there is a movie with will smith i will watch it he has a rare gift of pulling you into the movie and holding you there this movie is one of the best movies i have seen yet i watched it on saturday and i still cannot get it out of my head amazing and sad all at the same time thanks again will you must watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie you cannot miss a thing make sure you have plenty of kleenex and your man woman sitting next to you so you can cuddle well worth the money that you will pay to watch it don't wait for it to come on tv,1
as most off you might off seen star wars return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they m might have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one live tv when they are partying but before i say more when ben obi wan dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader real name anakin skywalker when they all are partying at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and yoda stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis that got killed with younglings under there arms in the back ground,1
we rented the dvd hoping for a good western the film was pretty and the scenes reasonable but the ideas were very bad here are my problems with the film br br in the first part why exactly did the bad guy kill the mine owner not really connected to the movie except to establish how bad he was and to have a hideout br br the bank employee gone bad just acts too poorly to convincingly decide to hire killers to off his employers at least keep us guessing no character developed at all for the bank owners or the bank employee br br very long delay in much of anything happening br br absurd premise that martin still needed to see the judge after the gang confessed to killing the in laws even more absurd that he confesses to judge and judge will not listen to the sheriff guy even more ridiculous that martin his hung and rope breaks then the sheriff takes him at gunpoint to finally head back to his town and save his wife from the bad bank employee wouldn't he just return after the quick dispatch of the gang to save wife and arrest bad bank guy just send the judge a note that gang confessed before being killed on trail overall very sad acting and no point to movie,0
a strange mix of traditional 80s smartassy chevy chase type every ten lines you get a funny one farce and sickie black comedy mildly amusing in spots but utterly tasteless there is a skiing sequence that includes the fakest looking back projections since on her majesty's secret service,0
possible spoilers br br when i saw this today i had some expectation of how it would be like not too high but not low either this was nothing like i expected at all though it seems to me like the movie makers couldn't make up their mind of what kind of movie to make br br in the begining of the film it's somewhat mysterious and kinda exciting but that'll soon change to some ridiculous scenes very obvious scenes as i watched further i almost fell asleep a couple of times br br the ending is the most ridiculous of all though almost splatter comedy br br i'm not saying it doesn't have some good scenes it's just that the film never becomes whole br br 4 10 movie man,0
from everything i'd read about the movie i was excited to support a film with a christian theme everything about the movie was very unprofessionally done especially the writing without good writing a movie doesn't have a chance the writer director said in an interview that he didn't want to give away how the title relates to the story believe me it was no big surprise i kept waiting for the teenage young adult back story to unfold but it never did as someone who has gone through a divorce i was very disappointed this movie would have been no comfort to me when i first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a christian,0
the secretary is one of those cheesy cliched thrillers that one is subjected to watching on a sunday afternoon when there is virtually nothing else on while the plot a demented woman becomes jealous of all who succeed over her in the office and decides to do whatever she can to stop them may be one of a kind i recognized countless plot twists probably taken from other tv movies that i had been subjected to for the very same reason br br to make matters worse i was not wild about the cast mel harris is one of those actresses who appears in so many tv movies as either a mom or some sort of victim of foul play or abuse that one must wonder the kind of life she leads in this one she gets the joy of playing a mom and a victim of psycho secretary sheila kelly who was not a very good choice as the villain while sheila kelly has made some good career moves singles breaking in and i guess law and order she is also beset by a string of pitiful tv movie roles and this one just adds to it as for the others i don't have any clear memories of them so that must say something br br this one will play on the lifetime network i think that's where i saw it but don't bother watching it unless you are too bored for words not that it will make you any more excitied,0
i came at this film with high expectations i was aware of greenaway's work and 'the tempest' and was interested in an adaptation i first wanted to switch off after ten minutes but felt that it would be unfair there was a representation of a storm but where in your mind do you conceive a small boy peeing over a toy boat it is symbolic of what i continued another ten minutes my finger twitching over the 'off' button somewhere something would capture my interest this is not shakespeare it is not cinema there is a time and place for it but i will not waste my time and there is no place for it in my studies of shakespeare after twenty five minutes i gave up and that was the end i then read all the comments on this website and the pretentiousness of the film is only matched by its defendants 'its a painting then put it in a gallery' 'it's a ballet keep it on the stage then' shakespeare can be done intelligently and the plays were performed to mass audiences they were accessible and this version helps put a wedge between shakespeare and the general population at large and i do not think that the bard would be happy with that,0
in 1993 the visitors was an enormous hit in france so the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made br br this is a movie that doesn't keep its promises indeed it's supposed to tell a sole story jean reno must go in the twentieth century and take christian clavier back in the middle ages so that time can normally follow its course the problem is that clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century and so make him get back in the middles ages is rather hard instead of this the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot as a consequence the movie becomes sometimes muddle headed sometimes a bit of a mess br br but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors reno and clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie they're going over the top and become annoying then why did jean marie poiré the film maker engage muriel robin in the female main role he made a mistake because she seems ill at ease and is absolutely pitiful the other actors aren't better marie anne chazel is nonexistent and christian bujeau unbearable br br of course the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness certain sequences and dialogs are affected it also appears hollow because poiré takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie thus a young girl takes reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding br br a labored and disappointing follow up anyway what's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial br br,0
i have to say although i despise these kind of shows shock horror i'm a girl i feel i have to express my opinion i had seen dirty sanchez before i saw jackass and think it way surpasses jackass in terms of programme making story lines and interviews are inter weaved to create a more interesting show i saw a few minutes of jackass movie the other night and couldn't believe how poorly put together it was everything just put in a line joke after joke with no relation between anything it must have been the quickest easiest show to edit ever shockingly amateur while drinking puke isn't really my thing as far as a substantial entertainment show goes dirty sanchez is way out of jackass's league,1
i'm stunned that the reviewers imdb gave this tv film as a high a rating as they did it's an innocuous sweet uncomplicated cliché' of a film that had two big names from the past in it both of whom did a decent job but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels i like a good romance as well as anyone but as my wife and i were watching this and before we saw the rating we said there are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there's nothing in it to challenge their brains their faith their comfort level or their cultural preferences it's possible to make a good film like that and away from her is an example but this was amateur hour there are some quite good films rated much lower than this one truly another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday films watch the family stone it's miles ahead of this schlock,0

this dvd appears to be targetted at someone who will just put it on and play it in an endless loop in the background it's organized as a series of music videos of the grand canyon set to various pieces of tangerine dream music br br unfortunately the td music is dull and the transfer to dvd looks rather blurry and dim too expensive a dvd for what it is,0
this film is a jolt of punk rock fun from start to finish the ramones reigning princes of late 70s punk rock appear as themselves pj soles stars as riff randle the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock 'n roll riff is obsessed with writing songs for the ramones her favorite rock band she keeps the school rockin' and encourages her fellow students to join her in her jubilant antics br br meanwhile the school that riff attends has just hired a brand new principal named ms togar she's a tall intimidating amazon of a woman and she vows to make the students 'toe the line' she even has a couple of the students act as monitors who report back to her with dirt on their classmates ms togar is especially determined to nab riff and put a stop to riff's anarchic shenanigans but riff has clever ways to foil togar at every turn br br kudos to the superb performance of mary woronov in her role as principal togar mary is a legendary b movie actress and in this film she plays the fascist ms togar with sneering relish pj soles as riff turns in an electrifying performance clint howard as the duplicitous eaglebauer has lots of fun with his role br br the ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film and so the viewer sees why the ramones were so influential in the 70s punk rock scene certainly this is a good film for ramones fans but even if you're not into the ramones or punk rock this movie is a terrific blast literally of energetic fun,1
this for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of marion davies she is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film i believe that lucille ball may have modeled her later career on davies' style that could be termed zany beauty vidor's direction is light but sure handed the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary and the star watching element for fans of the silent era with many cameos adds to the overall fun it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well for all movie fans who have a knee jerk reaction to watching silent films sit through this one and it may change your attitude br br,1
the book is so good that at least the opening of this made for tv movie will move you but then as it diverges more and more from the book taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches it becomes boring still from comments i've heard people who have not read the book tend to like it and if it leads even on child to read a wrinkle in time it will have served its purpose the most embarrassing change is to make the happy medium a clone of mary poppins' uncle albert i love to laugh nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny,0
there is only one problem with this website you can't give a negative rating additionally a mate rated this as a d grade movie i say he was being too nice a piece of wood could show more emotion that the actors in this movie and the money used to produce this movie would have been better used to start a fire this is absolutely terrible 2 hours of life that anyone who endures this untalented bloodbath will never get back after watching 5 minutes myself and the boys wondered if sinking bulk heavies would make this anymore entertaining half a carto and a bottle of 151 later i finally found some of this g grade acting remotely funny it's an insult upon this entire planet that the director thought anyone could find anything beneficial from this more he should go and buy a rope and to the actors in this flick i hope you got paid well to be in this joke because i doubt you will ever work again in summary i fine everyone in this movie 100 grand and 12 demerit points off your acting licence,0
this by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life i gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it borrowing some ideas from movies like resident evil and aliens doesn't result in a movie like them if this going to be a top korean movie i'd rather won't bother to see even a korean movie trailer br br by the way this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising i think every korean who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over the 8 even though has no clue what it is about,0
a bdsm sub culture of los angeles serves as backdrop for this low budget and shabbily constructed mess plainly a vanity piece for its top billed player celia xavier who also produces and scripts while performing a dual role as twin sisters vanessa and celia a question soon develops as to whether or not some rather immoderate camera lighting and editing pyrotechnics can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensate viewer celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the county of los angeles while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon cd roms but when disaster befalls mistress vanessa virtuous celia determined to unearth her sister's vicious attacker begins a new job as a sex slave at the private castle club where the specialty of the house is a dungeon party two fbi field agents whose deployment to the vanessa case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet bdsm sites in addition to a los angeles police department homicide detective are assigned to investigate the crime while endeavouring to provide security for celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her flaws in logic and continuity abound such as a homicide being allocated to l a p d 's operations south bureau a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film direction is unfocused and not aided by erratic post production editing and sound reproduction the mentioned photographic gymnastics culminate with a batty montage near the movie's end of prior footage that is but tangentially referent to the scenario one solid acting turn appears among this slag stan abe as a zealous fbi agent,0
acting is horrible this film makes fast and furious look like an academy award winning film they throw a few boobs and butts in there to try and keep you interested despite the extremely weak and far fetched story there is a reason why people on the internet aren't even downloading this movie this movie sunk like an iron turd do not waste your time renting or even downloading it this film is and always will be a perma turd i am now dumber for having watched it in fact this title should be referred to as a perma turd from now on calling it a film is a travesty and insult abhorrent abominable appalling awful beastly cruel detestable disagreeable disgusting dreadful eerie execrable fairy fearful frightful ghastly grim grisly gruesome heinous hideous horrendous horrid loathsome lousy lurid mean nasty obnoxious offensive repellent repulsive revolting scandalous scary shameful shocking sickie terrible terrifying ungodly unholy unkind,0
lipstick is another glossy movie failure i am trying to think of one good thing that i could say about the movie and i am having trouble coming up with something i guess the red dress that margaux hemingway was wearing in the end of the movie was the best part the writing and the script was not the worst that i have ever encountered but it could have been a lot better lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to view the sets were very glossy and nice to look at the cast was okay i felt like anne bancroft's character was the only feasible character in the entire movie it was sad to see chris sarandon waste his time on this one,0

this was a must see documentary for me when i missed the opportunity in 2004 so i was definitely going to watch the repeat i really sympathised with the main character of the film because this is true i have a milder condition of the skin problem he had dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa eb this is a sad sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder jonny kennedy speaks like a kid because of wasting vocal muscle and never went through puberty but he is 36 years old most sympathising moments are seeing his terrible condition and pealing off his bandages jonny had quite a naughty sense of humour he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin he tells his story with the help of his mother edna kennedy his older brother and celebrity model and jonny's supporter nell mcandrew it won the baftas for best editing and best new director factual and it was nominated for best sound factual and the flaherty documentary award it was number 10 on the 100 greatest tv treats 2004 a must see documentary,1
this movie struck home for me being 29 i remember the '80's and my father working in a factory i figured if i worked hard too if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream the house a few kids a car all to call my own i've noted however without a degree in something unlike my father that quit at ninth grade and a keen sense of greed and laziness you can't get anywhere br br i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs it's made for tv and i just saw it an hour ago ic an't find it anywhere i'd love to show this to my friends my pseudo friends family and other relatives see what they think and remind them that once upon a time americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished i think the feeling is still there but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas,1
it's been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad the acting is very average the story is horribly boring and i'm at a loss for words as to the execution it was completely unoriginal o and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwood's a pregnant schwarzenegger br br one of the first scenes the one with the television show where the hell are you got it right the cast was 80 of let's face it forgotten actors if they were hoping for a career relaunch then i think it might never happen with this on their cv the script had the potential but neither 80 of the actors nor the director who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor pulled it off fred durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest br br i'm sorry but if you ever consider watching this i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic because not only it's a total loss of time but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like,0
this story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last harem of the ottoman empire well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone and learn about the people who lived there br br i enjoyed the story characters acting and scenes a few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly otherwise a wonderful piece br br the main character safiya is played wonderfully by marie gillain who i am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it the scenes with her and alex descas nadir are charming and lovely br br i recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating,1
this scary and rather gory adaptation of stephen king's great novel features outstanding central performances by dale midkiff fred gwynne who sadly died few years ago and denise crosby and some really gruesome gore effects director mary lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style and manages to make this one of the few versions of king's work that is not only worth seeing but genuinely unnerving the depiction of the zombie child gage miko hughes later in new nightmare is equally noteworthy as what could easily have been a laughable character is made menacing and spooky as for the people who think that this one isn't scary watch it alone in the dark eventually with your squeamish girlfriend and i guarantee you that pet sematary will creep you out some horror movies like this one or the texas chain saw massacre shouldn't be watched in group recommended for horror fans,1
the 100 black and white half hour episodes of the early situation comedy mr peepers were originally broadcast from 1952 55 on nbc like a lot of baby boomers this and ding dong school are my earliest memories of television since both ran later in syndication it is hard to tell how many of these memories are actually tied to the original broadcasts br br mr peepers is worth checking out for more than its nostalgia value it represents a very different style of situation comedy than shows like the honeymooners and i love lucy the genre could have gone in two different directions in those days and ended up taking the loud abrasive path of those two shows which is probably why they still seem contemporary br br mr peepers which was differentiated by its intelligent restrained tone may appear slow and dull in comparison but it's really more a matter of adjusting to the different style once you get into the characters it will win over most intelligent viewers credit should be give to the show's producer fred coe a key figure in early television whose dramatic anthologies are also worth checking out philco television playhouse lights out playhouse 90 producers showcase playwrights 56 fireside theatre etc even on kinescope br br mr peepers offered a much more gentle style with wally cox to be the voice of underdog a few years later in the title role robinson peepers a mild mannered high school science teacher his glasses were his trademark and a symbolic link to his name and role as a passive observer br br the series provided cox with an outstanding supporting cast tony randall played his brash best friend history teacher harvey weskit jack warden played frank whip the loud gym teacher whose mild bullying gave the show most of its conflict elements br br there is some love interest competition involving the school's nurse nancy remington patricia benoit with viewers quickly aligning with mr peepers who seems a much better match for the gentle nancy their on screen marriage near the end 1953 54 season captured national attention an early version of the who shot j r frenzy br br then again what do i know i'm only a child,1
i was unsure whether or not andy sidaris could repeat his success with the cinematic hit malibu express with his film fit to kill he has proved that sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a one shot director the plot written by sidaris which was ungratefully passed up by the academy is a complex screenplay involving many unseen twists and turns the main characters composed work for a sexually based radio station known as ksxy cleverly ksxy is actually their secret headquarters in fit to kill they confront their long time nemesis kane who is trying to steal one of russia's most prized diamonds a well written screenplay is not all excellent acting by the cast helps to ensure this film as a cult classic panned by the critics and the box office this film will be appreciated in years to come it is now suffering the same fate as clockwork orange and taxi driver did but in the future will undoubtly become recognized i am disappointed no critic circles have recognized andy sidaris's trademark filmmaking the costumes the special effects all help to compliment this already beautiful piece of filmmaking it may do you best to ignore the dismal 3 rating on this film and go out and rent it for yourself my personal rating is 10 10 the drama is as thick as the blockbuster runaway bride and the action better or equal to the cinematic masterpiece last action hero andy keep up the good work,0
you have to admire brad sykes even if you don't particularly want to a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions but keeps on doing it all the same even the half hearted praise than surrounds his camp blood films is given grudgingly and i'm as guilty of this as anyone brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix a neat idea a kooky character whatever but without the funds to take it further than base level he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be joe haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as ebenezer jackson and its a credit to sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film coming to a multiplex near you in a parallel universe somewhere,0
this is the worst movie i have ever seen everyone involved should be embarrassed everyone ice t is pitiful the dialogue is absolutely awful and hokie does not begin to describe the performances by every single actor in this movie the plot steals heavily from executive decision but compared to air rage executive decision is academy award material i have never been so disappointed when watching a movie air rage should be burned with its ashes locked in a vault never to see the light of day again anyone who has seen it should take a shower and wash the stink of horrible movie off of them the best part of this movie probably comes from the ending when the credits rolled this was easily the worst movie i have ever seen br br ice t should stick to law and order and the other people in this film should retire early or commit suicide either way they should never attempt to be in a movie again,0
astaire and rogers at the height of their popularity in 1936 americans thought of the navy as a place for song and dance wwii was still a few years away fred and ginger dance up the town br br the plot is decent but who cares by the way notice the cameo roles for betty grable and a glamorous lucile ball br br a load of irving berlin songs including the famous let's face the music and dance in that scene ginger's heavy swooping dress smacks fred in the face during one of her spins and almost knocks him unconscious fred insisted on keeping the take as the dancing was superb nonetheless br br ginger once commented that she was a better dancer than fred since she had to do all the same moves in step and backwards br br come to think of it fred's voice was nice too the man was effortless in motion br br here's a movie to cozy up on the couch with a loved one kick off the shoes and enjoy the entertainment,1
i do not know who is to blame miss leigh or her director but her performance as catherine is almost impossible to watch ben chaplin on the other hand does a superior job against all odds as far as i am concerned his character is entirely too charming and appealing but certainly not shown as greedy enough to put up with leigh's character's silliness chaplin appears bemused by what cannot possibly be understood as leigh's shyness and lack of grace but rather her orthopedic unsteadiness there has to be some element of believability to his interest but as played it is incomprehensible the performances do not jibe maggie smith and albert finney are of course wonderful despite any effort to derail them the supporting cast is also a pleasure to watch what a pity too the leads don't work together because the production is lovely to look at,0
for a low budget project the film was a success the story is interesting and the actors were convincing eva longoria who now stars on the tv show dragnet is sexier than ever the locations were ideal for the ganster plot and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project of course this low budget film could use better editing transitions and more special effects for the gun scenes but the music keeps this script moving although this film has it's share of problems such as continuity i must say that i would rent the director's next movie if your a film student you could learn a few things from the director's commentary,1
pretty poor firestarter clone that seems more like a bad tv movie than a bad feature film how disappointing for this to come from hooper and dourif br br government contractors do a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb the boy born to the couple from the experiment constantly runs a fever of 100 degrees and when he's an adult people in his life start spontaneously combusting he tries to find out why br br the people completely on fire are well done but when they get to the point that they are well done in another sense they're obviously changed to dummies when jets of fire shoot out of characters' arms it looks silly rather than alarming the way it should also ridiculous is fire that evidently travels through phone lines and erupts in huge jets from the receiver's earpiece how is that supposed to happen exactly br br something else that struck me as silly about the movie is when a character has visions of his late parents we later see the exact same shots from those visions in home movies,0
how can you resist watching a film with some swing it's a delightful little film full of wonderful actors and a wonderful story line too bad they don't tour out here i'd go see them see it if for no other reason than to hear some good music,1
great actors an oscar nominee actress stunning scenery good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag and thats quite big this film was brilliant it was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were well side splitting i have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the 'stoned ladies in the tea shop' scene well done to the british film industry and to craig ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year if not of all time,1
yes this movie is bad what's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title in the entire movie zombies and vampires fight each other once or twice on top of that we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is definitely a vampire one might argue they were trying to tone it down or make it realistic but it ends up just boring more than half of this movie takes place in a car the scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about either also there's no clear antagonist and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie br br however i will say that for a film this low in production value the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere br br i'm all for independent films but it doesn't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience if any br br worse than scarecrow slayer,0
though a bit more polished technically than the previous film in the series bulldog drummond escapes this is a weaker escapade in both a plot that's less thrilling and a leading man who simply doesn't have the charisma of ray milland br br that said several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying also john barrymore is present popping up all through the film in a variety of outlandish disguises br br anyway it's another endless night for bd as he and his cohorts chase around trying to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry the clues are stupid but again the supporting actors often make them entertaining,0
anita and me seems to be little more than an excuse for meera syal the author of the novel and screenplay to air her prejudices grievances and general antipathy towards the english the general sentiment of indian superiority over the english in this film is foul br br the english people in this film are portrayed as overweight violent foul mouthed promiscuous engaging in child neglect stupid uneducated racist ugly eating poor food and dim witted tellingly only by turning to indian culture can the local priest be redeemed at the end of the film br br by contrast the indian family are beautiful clever educated can speak many languages are caring and loving parents and grammar school fodder the film is so insidiously prejudicial that i am astonished the bbc funded it at all had it been the other way round an english family in an indian community depicted this way the film would have been seen as racist br br there were a few moments where my eyebrow shot so far up my forehead i thought it would lodge in my hairline first the gossip scene between the women at the divali celebration undertext the english are dirty and promiscuous and the men undertext english women are prostitutes second the meal with anita where neema's family lie to her about cutlery undertext the english are so stupid you can make them do anything br br but the underlying contempt towards anything english even english weddings are an object of scorn is evident all the way through the film the character of anita was drawn so appallingly almost the fallen woman trope that i finished the film feeling angry br br this is not a bend it like beckham where the humour is focused on loving exaggerations of a community's behaviour and customs from somebody within that community and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together instead anita and me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable as the english are almost an version of the indian untouchable caste and this is underscored by a thinly veiled series of attacks upon the film's other community the english br br i felt anita and me is a hate filled grievance based piece of work on that basis the bbc should not have funded its production,0
this is an excellent film with an extraordinary cast and acting i was very disappointed with the academy awards when this didn't get the oscar for best film and for best actress woopi goldberg it certainly deserved it in any case take a look at it i am sure you will enjoy it very much,1
i would rather have 20 root canals than go through this film again the prince of annoying myles berkowitz has wasted nearly two hours of my life with this piece of cynical pseudo cool the only amusing thing in this whole mess is mr samaha's obnoxious off camera patter about tits and ass berkowitz takes a great concept and grinds it into the dust it is choppy and badly done in an apparent effort to make it seem edgy or funny it is neither i seldom feel that a movie was a waste of film or tape but this one qualifies for that distinction if a date suggests seeing this film run,0
this pm entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make john woo say enough already of course it isn't nearly as beautiful as woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in 90 minutes eric phillips don wilson is an undercover cop in the near future when his wife is framed for murdering the governor by a team using a look a like cyborg it is up to eric to clear her name wilson gets to pull van damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger why the academy failed to take notice is beyond me being a pm production there are tons of car chases exploding cars 4 in the first 5 minutes and shoot outs i particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck my other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in don's simulator it is merely a chance to show off some cheapo lawnmower man effects circa 1995,1
rated e contains violence br br i had the original spiderman game for the pc for a couple of years now i still have not beaten it because on windows xp there is a glitch on one level which i cant beat because of it so be warned if you have xp but for those who don't have xp give this game a try its a fun clean family game with action and its great for any spiderman fan in the game you play spiderman and you take on various criminals who commit crimes spiderman is a fun little game and i recommend it to any spiderman fan or a parent wanting a fun clean game for their kids br br 8 10,1
i'm not a fan of adam sandler in fact i don't think i've ever liked him in anything i've seen him in the opening scene of this movie confirmed my worst fears there was adam sandler playing a somewhat ridiculous looking character riding around new york city on a motor scooter looking pitiful and lost typical sandler type loser character again i thought i almost gave up then and there but then as i stuck with this i actually discovered something i never knew before adam sandler can act he is truly outstanding in this movie as charlie a lost and lonely figure whose entire family including the dog was killed in one of the hijacked planes on 9 11 and who has apparently lost all touch with reality as a result don cheadle plays his former college roommate who unexpectedly reconnects with charlie and takes it on as his mission to help him get better of course cheadle's alan johnson has his own problems and sources of unhappiness and somehow these two men manage to help each other through their difficulties the two of them made a completely believable team and sandler in particular made charlie real working through his emotions and feelings this is not a sandler comedy if your looking for that go to some of his other sillier stuff this is a pretty heavy movie sometimes sad sometimes hopeful and always engrossing there are some funny parts in it i loved the scene in which charlie convinces alan to confront his partners by reminding him of how tough he was in college and then the conversation the two of them have afterward br br i personally didn't think that saffron burrows added much to the movie as donna an obviously needy patient of johnson's the only reason for the character seemed based on one flashback to be that she looked eerily like charlie's late wife but that was never really developed and i just didn't care that much for the character do look for the part of the judge however played by donald sutherland who i thought nailed the part bang on as far as i'm concerned though this is sandler's movie and kudos to him for a great performance definitely his best in my opinion 8 10,1
plot melissa is a new girl in town she's fifteen years old and her birthday is coming up in one week since melissa is beautiful every boy in town wants to hook up with her but the few that manage to catch her interest mysteriously die br br to be honest the real reason i wanted to watch this film is because dana kimmel of friday the 13th pt 3 was in it which isn't a proper reason why to rush out and see a movie when i started watching it i realized that sweet sixteen isn't a very good slasher it's really dull and boring and just doesn't go anywhere after over an hour only three murders have occurred and the story hasn't really developed in any possible way br br the movie is nicely shot with quite nice photography and good directing but just as with many other slasher flicks from the 80s the movie suffers from being too dark at times the acting is actually pretty good though and melissa's character is easy to sympathize with even though she's a complete slut br br the story line isn't completely rubbish but it's just way too dull to keep you interested the only things that kept me interested was melissa she was stunning and dana kimmel whose really sweet and cute in this movie br br all in all pretty dull slasher flick that doesn't go anywhere i'd definitely wouldn't recommend it to slasher fans,0
one of the most timely and engrossing documentaries you'll ever watch while the story takes place in the venezuelan capital of caracas it provides an intimate look into political dynamics that prevail throughout the western hemisphere while essentially another chapter in the story of the u s backed latin american coup this film chronicles in real time what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity political savvy and courage br br the political insights offered by this film are invaluable one gets clear examples of the private media as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda we see the poor people of caracas grappling with the brutal realities of american politics one gets a clear sense of impending doom if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny which has been abruptly and illegally thrust upon them by the conspirators we also see the arrogance and fascism of the cia backed private media plutocrats and generals who've conspired to bring venezuela back under washington's domination though ably led by president hugo chavez the people of caracas are forced to act without him after chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals their response is the highpoint of the film if one seeks an excellent portrait of what the u s government hugo chavez and revolutionary venezuela are all about this movie is it,1
who made this film i love this film somebody has a wacky sense of humor br br this zany surreal style of film making is appealing but it is hard to create or easy to forget that substance and characters who actually have souls are what give such a film depth without that a comedy is just a bunch of ideas who cares it may get laughs but it goes through you like a half good hamburger next br br crosseyed may not intend to change anybody's life but i appreciate the depth and substance they sneak up on you i started this film thinking oh i get it indie comedy off the wall gonzo yup and it is that but if you pay attention there is sub text and character moments filling it out in this sense the film breathes it makes propositions that give pause if you're available to see them and then of course it goes on its insanely merry way br br you will miss the point if you don't sign the contract to suspend belief at moments in the film stepping between reality and surreality is one of the points of this movie br br crosseyed isn't perfect but smart people made it i want more br br the dining room scenes are an absolute hoot br br put on your seat belt,1
first there is no way the remake can be as good because japanese society is quite different from ours and plays such a major part in this film as explained in the opening narration it adds to the humor as well as warmth of this movie there is slew of different supporting characters personalities each does there part in making this movie wonderful this movie is full of comedy that isn't vulgar in anyway like most of today's gross out comedies yet it can still have you laughing out loud the reality is in real life you don't have a choice of who you work with or go to school with etc this movie truly emphasizes that and shows that the natural good in people can overcome petty differences not to mention it makes for a great sub plot and much of the humor this is a story about dance that actually has a story and a good one at that there are a few back stories that are not out of place but actually support the main storyline truly a well written film the dancing is great too i happen to be a fan of any movie with dancing of any sort for that aspect however this movie goes beyond any other with dance in the fact that it is a story first and just happens to be written about dancing in japanse society highly recommended br br 10 out of 10,1
this film is self indulgent rubbish watch this film if you merely want to hear spoken gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed it should be charming but isn't it's just irritating the characters are difficult to care about and the acting is poor the stories within the film are also charmless and sinister i was expecting a heartwarming family film but this also held no appeal to my fourteen year old daughter it is rarely that i cannot see a film through to its conclusion but this one got the better of both of us br br although the film is set in current times it has the look and feel of a cheap east european film made during the cold war there isn't even enough in the way of beautiful scottish scenery and cinematography to redeem it a real shame because as a film this is an embarrassment to scotland,0
as did others in this forum when fobidden planet was offered in 1956 i rushed to see it this story is an interesting phenomenon i suggest because young old male female sci fi experts and people who find such fare 'way out all can follow and enjoy this film's story and plot lines very well this is the first movie set on a planet other than earth in the 20th century other than serials such as flash gordon leslie nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his role at that time but walter pigeon marvin miller anne francis richard anderson earl holliman and especially warren stevens all acquitted themselves very well there are so many visual splendors in this one it's hard to choose a favorite from the film's scenes the approach to altair 4 the starship itself the landing on the planet's alien surface the descent via extensor stairs the first view of the landscape the approach of the rocket sled dr morbius's house seen from without and from within the underground complex and its wonders the setup of the weaponry the battle with the monster the final approach of the unseen destroyer the escape from the doomed planet all these scenes are etched into the viewer's mind because we discover them along with the participants veteran cyril hume's literate script was filmed intelligently by long time director fred mcleod wilcox with clarity and imagination it is a shock to realize there's no music at all the film is carried by the words the actors and the mystery revelation storyline it can be watched again and again with pleasure i have been doing so for nearly fifty years until this famous and well loved film was created no film had tried to imagine a world beyond earth and for decades afterward ships kept crashing back on the planet as if the writers' imaginations were failing and causing the crashes still the best many say that says something negative about this nation's so called intellectual leaders' imaginations and something very positive indeed i suggest about those who made this gem,1
susan seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top notch credits under her belt i'm certainly glad she bounced back from this film which seems to have its admirers i'm not one of them br br i've seen better acting in high school plays than i did in smithereens the plot such as it is involved young susan berman who is ambitious to make it in the world of music and is willing to do just about anything to get there she even rejects the sincere advances of a young artist who is living out of his van off the east river played by brad rijn br br young mr rijn contributes the worst performance in the film in fact one of the worst acting jobs i've seen in a long time no wonder he's not gone anywhere br br i will say that seidelman's eye for the camera is a good one in capturing the familiar east village locations where the film was mostly shot but her work with her live performers didn't measure up i'm not sure she had that much raw material to work with br br look fast and you'll see a very young christopher noth before law and order and sex in the city as a street hustler br br if you like punk rock you might sit through this for the soundtrack i'll stick to bing crosby,0
say what you will about schmaltz one beauty of this film is that it is not pro american it is a morality about some americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion it is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose br br to me the most interesting part of the film is the education of fanny and david farrelly bette davis' mother and brother as fanny says we've been shaken out of the magnolias br br in today's political climate where led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used 9 11 to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings we sunk to the level of the 9 11 murderers to seek blood thirsty vengeance it can't all be blamed on mr bush after all we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re elected him after his lies had been exposed now with complete justification we americans are reviled throughout the world br br today we watch this film with a new awareness that the rise to power of nazis in germany was not due to a flaw in the german character but a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts i'm not comparing george bush to adolph hitler but i am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror hatred and hyper nationalism to do despicable things br br sadly the blackmailer who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement no matter how immoral is most like the leaders of our country those who support them and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand that they can't even be bothered to vote br br a film like watch on the rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be a force for the betterment of humanity and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals br br geoff,1
maybe i'm missing something because i've read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than i have read bad reviews and i just don't get it i like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak look and act like humphrey bogart in the big sleep or gene tierney in laura none of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it take the lead actor lee j cobb his rumpled rolled out of bed look is about as far from the dashing smooth talking noir archetype as you'll find or take jane wyatt as the femme fatale as another example this is one of the worst cases of miscasting i've seen in a while she's just not convincing in the role br br as for the plot it's tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre i could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated himself after about five minutes and that final cat and mouse chase scene is plain old dull ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it,0
this reminded me soo much of michael winner's crappy 'dirty weekend' with it's awful english low budget feel br br firstly i must say i am a fan of both exploitation and serious film i appreciate say 'demented' for it's ineptitude and 'last house on the left' for it's sheer unashamed brutality and any number of inventive and increasingly brutal italian spin offs br br this was just pointless though kind of like a british budget director thought 'let's remake i spit on your grave without making it too harrowing now that horror is back in fashion with hostel br br the whole thing just doesn't hang together or have a point what's with the rapists's daughter why bother having the man be an expert in security cameras crappy,0
spoilers ahead proceed at your own caution br br my main problem with this movie is that once harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers with relative ease he continues to cave into their demands and then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped he decides to wire his classic car up to explode with the money in it which makes us take a pretty tall leap of logic br br okay so he wanted to keep his affair with cini out of the public eye due to his wife's involvement with the da campaign this i can see but why not hire someone to slap these turds around a bit or even kill them once he'd determined there was no actual blackmail evidence e g cini's body this was a pretty interesting movie for the first 2 3 of it after that it sort of falls apart,0
this is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen again i made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too after buying this and the movie malevolence which i reviewed on here as well i have learned my lesson i love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm this supposedly takes place in the woods of texas but was probably filmed in the director's backyard the production was probably the worst i ever seen the actors were absolutely the worst the story didn't have anything to do with what the back cover said i even tried to sell it to f y e and some other mom and pop store that buys used dvds and neither would take it thats how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was i have seen some bad movies before troll 2 for example but this definitely takes the cake i didn't think there was a worse movie than troll 2 boy was i wrong do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but even than your stuck with it unless you throw it out which is what i am about to do,0
flavia the heretic is a strange entry in the nunsploit genre equal parts sleaze feministic journey and history as we follow flavia on her strange trip br br we start off with flavia in a convent she ain't too happy there cuz she doesn't believe in all the male dominated rules and macho ism of the world around her and escapes from the convent with her jewish pal abraham they are both eventually caught and flavia is brought back to the convent where she joins another non believing nun in hastening a moslem invasion flavia hangs out with the moslems who take over the convent and get busy with the nuns in a strange set of scenes eventually the moslems roll out and flavia is punished as a traitor to christianity in another singularly brutal scene br br this one has pretty much all the stuff that i like to see in a 70's era exploit film some good gore including nipple removal and a nice leg skinning scene some decent nudity including the requisite full frontal and a decent storyline as well i will say that it sorta dragged in a few points but not enough to get truly bored with it i would definitely recommend this one to nunsploit 70's exploit fans 8 10,1
i watched this movie with my mother when i was in high school many years ago i definitely was not the least bit interested in opera at the time but he changed my views i enjoyed this movie very much and have truly enjoyed opera ever since i even bought several of his cd's who cares what his acting abilities were he basically just played himself which was adorable he was so charming so charismatic i honestly just wanted to hug him i feel very sad that so many are criticizing him so harshly it was so straight did not accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions he deserves to be respected and admired for his talent he will definitely be missed,1
i love this movie but can't get what is in this movie tht is not to like people who don't like this movie must be richard roeper and roger ebert but i can't believe that is mr carrey behind all that makeup and i am sure that most of the actors and actresses in the movie has made film before this and there is a new face in the movie taylor momsen who plays cindy lou who as the opens the grinch jim carrey comes out of hiding and causes some mean fun to the whos in whoville sicne we know that the whos love christmas while the grinch does not like christmas and even makes fun of little cindy lou who taylor momsen who is the daughter of the town's postmaster bill irwin the movie was directed by ron howard and the narrtor's voice is done by anthony hopkins and jeffrey tambor muppets from space is cast as the mayor of whoville who doesn't like talking about the grinch close to christmas time,1
one of several musicals about sailors on leave it is the usual sailor meets girl complications ensue sorted out happily kind of plot it proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too the dialogue is not as zippy as 'top hat' for example and randolph scott seems out of place br br there are compensations it has some of irving berlin's choicest songs including 'let yourself go' 'i'm putting all my eggs in one basket' and 'let's face the music and dance' it has fred and ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they don't disappoint here they do a snappy tap dance a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance all in the same film great versatility and artistry br br it also has harriet hilliard who is rather good in her role she had a varied career becoming the more famous harriet nelson with ozzie here she is touching without being sentimental her two songs are simply and effectively delivered she makes a good contrast with ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film br br more tightening up have made the film even better pretty good though,1

a fine martino outing this is a spirited and enjoyable giallo with fine performances from good looking cast and principally the two leads george hilton and anita strindberg br br for me the jig saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists enjoyable twists it has to be said br br sexy with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with london athens and greek coastal locations a super finale set upon aegean rocks wraps things up and much fun was had by all,1
i wanted to like this movie but many elements ruined it for me the use of a fisheye lens throughout and choppy editing did not give me a sense of being in the world of the meth head but it did make me think i was watching mtv for a few short moments the movie never did seem to go anywhere and the acting was truly an excellent example of over acting i love movies that give us a glimpse into the seedy underworld but this film couldn't decide if it was a bad horror film or an even worse serious commentary on the horrors of addiction,0
this movie sucked they took something from my childhood and raped it in an outhouse this movie was so bad i wanted to go home and hold my dukes dvds and cry in a corner the cast was terrible it wasn't the dukes it was stiffler and jackass driving a car when was boss hogg evil when was rosco a tough guy they never were boss hogg was greedy and rosco was an idiot when did jesse smoke pot he never did now don't get me wrong i'm very liberal and there's nothing wrong with a little chiba but it had no place in this movie the only thing good about this movie was the trailers before the movie and the end credits it was a waste of money time and air avoid at all costs,0
it was 9 30 pm last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park a new episode the thing is in my country south park airs at 10 30 pm and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing father of the pride i'll start by saying that i have only watched to episodes the first time i watched it i found it unfunny and crude for nothing so i thought ''holy sh t i have a football game early tomorrow so i have to stop watching stupid cartoons'' but yesterday i tried to give father of the pride a second chance i find that it's a complete rip off of the simpsons only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead br br the second thing is i wonder why it got it's tv 14 rating i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual unfunny jokes the simpsons is also a lot more violent halloween specials and crude i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek 2 well i've got news for him shrek 2 was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family thematic however i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile even burst out laughing once three or four times br br all in all i don't mind father of the pride i don't hate it but i don't like either i've seen way better from ''the simpsons'' br br 3 5 10,0
producer joel schumacher who also directed phone booth '02 and many other great films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into combat colin farrell roland bozz intermission '03 gave one of his best performances and actually carried this entire picture on his back matthew davis jim paxton blue crush '02 gave a great supporting role and shea whigham pvt wilson all the real girls '03 showed his true acting skills in the role that he played there was two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires one army veteran instructor from viet nam told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body enjoyable and entertaining film to view,1
if you have not seen this excellent movie about life in the 90s in l a then you've missed a special treat this is one of the most amazingly and most powerful movies ever made about life for americans in the 90s and it even carries over into today's world in which we live in it covers everything from raising a child prejudice more than one way love adultery empty nest syndrome selfishness etc and the list goes on this story builds up to an ultimate climax and then when nothing else matters it always goes back to love with friends and family and love of life it helps us dig deep within ourselves and to make us search for what we want out of life makes us ask questions of ourselves have we done enough for others are we like this etc sit back and enjoy a wonderfully done and emotional movie that i'm sure others will enjoy for a lifetime br br take note of mary mcdonnell kevin kline and danny glover's wonderful performance through this whole film these actors are amazing and really show the true glow and meaning of what message is being sent to all of us these are 3 of my favorite actors for life after seeing this film over 10 years ago now i still enjoy it again and again also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with it and don't forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly by and try to figure out it's symbolism for the movie hmmm i almost forgot this is probably steve martin's very first serious acting role in any film he has ever done he too does an excellent job in this movie this may come as a surprise to most of you sit back relax and enjoy truly good film making,1
hollywood always had trouble coming to terms with a religious picture strange cargo proves to be no exception although utilizing the talents of a superb cast and produced on a top budget with suitably moody photography by robert planck the movie fails dismally on the credibility score perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upsets the viewer's involvement in the action and with the fate of the characters i found it difficult to sit still through all the contrived metaphors parallels and biblical references and impossible to accept bathed in light ian hunter's smug know it all as a christ figure and the censors in boston detroit and providence at least agreed with me the movie was banned few boston detroit providence moviegoers if any complained or journeyed to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that gable and crawford had somehow become involved in a message picture it flopped everywhere br br oddly enough the movie has enjoyed something of a revival on tv a home atmosphere appears to make the movie's allegory more receptive to viewers however despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film the plot of this strange cargo flows along predictable heavily moralistic lines that will have no one guessing how the principal characters will eventually come to terms with destiny,0
i have to admit that purple rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures purple rain not only broke boundaries it set a decade the costumes the music the behavior and the dancing to this day my friends and i still jam to the purple rain soundtrack and pretend to be prince and the revolution br br now the movie itself i just meant what i said in the title because for the most part this movie itself is made by the music the acting please don't let me judge on that since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures because i know that it was not oscar worthy by any means but i think the duo that took this movie was morris and jarome their speech about passwords was just beyond hilarious i just want to rate this movie on the concert sequences because i felt that it was what made the movie br br prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music while the movie and acting is pretty bad this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too this movie defined the 80's so just have fun with it prince would want it that way just to party on down oh boy that sounded lame br br 9 10,1
baldwin has really stooped low to make such movies the script the music just about everything in this movie is a waste of time br br the sound fx do not sound real they stick out way too much technical gadgets etc if they are trying to make a movie about things like this at least try to get real with it and drop those extra bleeps and beeps because those gadgets don't really make loud sounds like that natural sounds like footsteps and such are non existent which gives it a void like atmosphere br br directing seems to be ok for such a low budget film i sure hope it was a low budget production although it does seem fairly amateurish at times br br most characters seem empty and false they simply haven't casted this movie very well i'd imagine it would've been a better idea to make baldwin speak some spanish than to make spanish actors speak english when we all know that theirs is the language which is more vibrant and alive that is why the actors performance can suffer greatly if an odd language is used i mean could finally someone realise how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak english with a bad accent it's should've a long ago buried corpse in movie production the production team ever heard of subtitles this movie again manages to depict european police as lazy and corrupt the societies as vulnerable and helpless i mean if the plot again goes like the interpol can't do jack so let's call one american to bring down this international syndicate or whatever br br sony pictures treads on the same path as columbia before it just producing movies for the hell of it i'd imagine them to have some self respect also are buyers supposed to buy every dirty title just because sony puts out something good a few times a year maybe they should've used the same team as who were making di que si say i do it's spoken in spanish and paz vega and santi millan do a decent job keeping the movie afloat looks and sounds much better come on sony wake up produce less sell more,0
i love westerns i could watch them all day the good the bad and the ugly is my all time favorite i watched silverado for probably the 8th time just the other day because it was being featured on cmt however this movie shiloh falls is without a doubt the worst western i have ever watched the acting was terrible all around they explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass looking thing the only good part i can think of is the good looking cantina girl the very noticeable long pauses between the dialog seemed intentional just to make up time to make the movie of acceptable length this movie wasn't even worth the new rental fee i paid at our local movie rental store i felt like i was robbed and deserving of a rental refund if there was such a thing only reason i finished it was because i hate to not see a movie through to the end i turned it off half way through because it was so bad to the director please do a better job if you decide to make another this is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to westerns,0
most 70s and 80s kong kong martial arts films barely function as movies usually there are a few well planned fight sequences but the plot is scraped pretty thin to fill in the gaps between those nodes like porno films really br br but this one does several things well most overtly there is the direction and choreography which confines each combatant to a 'style' it's really based on chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater but the effect works br br second there is the language of the camera which uses some impressive techniques even by today's measure changing projection speeds from real time time to slow motion and from unfiltered to filtered views to depict story direction toward the past or toward the future br br least overt but most powerful and unexpected is the construction the winner of this contest is determined by who 'unfolds' the story the master the writer sets up a game where the lead character doesn't know who he's seeking which is the same situation we viewers find ourselves in one by one he figures out who is who at the same rate we find out who is who it all follows a tragedy noir arc the ending tends toward irony a la the sting much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genre br br the 'five venoms' idea is the template for tarantino's 'deadly viper assassins' from the kill bill volumes,1
i am rarely moved to make these kind of comments but after sitting through most of rankin's dreadful movie i feel like i have really earned the right to say what i feel about it i couldn't actually make it right to the end and became one of the half dozen or more walk outs about 1 3rd of the audience after the ragged plot woeful dialogue and insulting characterisation became just too much to bear this film is all pose and no art all style and no substance it is weighed down by dreadful acting a genuinely dire script indifferent cinematography and student level production values how it got funded started and finished is a mystery to me i bet you a million quid it never goes on general release the proper critics would tear it apart a really bad film shockingly bad a really really really poor effort and that is without even mentioning the gratuitous new born kitten gets dropped into a deep fat fryer moment totally meaningless utterly lightweight poorly put together this movie is a dreadful embarrassment for uk cinema,0
deceptive advertising i saw a commercial for carlitos way rise to power that states from the producer of scarface and carlito's way lets get it straight michael bergman did not produce scarface in fact he was 'editing room assistant' for scarface not to take away from bergman's talent but in my opinion he should of had a little more class i think i can speak for the masses when i say we hate being blatantly lied to as far as the movie goes it was poor at best i did think puff daddy did a good job although luis guzman should be ashamed for working on this film overall this film did not do a good job filling in the blanks for carlito's way it's obvious this project was an attempt to make a quick buck rather a good film,0
spoilers 9 11 is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on the wtc 2 french film makers who are in new york to film the actions of a nyfd are being confronted with this event and make the most of it before 9 11 nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario on the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon change as one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing plane this is the only footage of the first impact he rides with the firemen to the wtc and goes inside the building as the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident in the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possible in the meanwhile we hear banging sounds these are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the ground this is the most grueling moment in the documentary then the tower collapses and our french friend has to run for his life you hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the building then a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown new york because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybody's memory i saw the attacks live at home because i had the afternoon of so this makes it even more realistic to watch 10 10,1
alright friends a serious movie buff is expected to watch all kinds of movie the bad as well as the good and this movie put me to the test i won't mince words this movie was bad the story was bad the acting was bad the always wonderful sissy spacek did nothing to make this movie better indeed i asked myself why did i even bother to see this rotten trashy movie why did i waste my time and money on something that i suspected would be bad the answer is of course that i am a movie buff and therefore cannot avoid what otherwise should be avoided i will not waste your time explaining what exactly was wrong with this amateurish movie except to say that the quality of the acting was to put it politely subpaar a serious movie buff may want to take on the responsibility of watching this movie otherwise stay home don't waste your time read a book take take of chores or have yourself a good sandwich,0

spoilers br br this movie always seems very exaggerated until i remember that my college campus had a former student turned nazi racist killer who then committed suicide too his name was benjamin nathaniel smith br br look him up in the wikipedia i added a few photos to their article about him br br it's hard to believe but this stuff really does happen br br i'm not a big fan of omar epps or ice cube but larry fishburne kristy swanson jennifer connelly mike rappaport were good,1
picked up the movie at the flea market for 4 bucks sure did get my moneys worth could care less about the hot babes but the animation just blew me away after a steady diet of simpsons sorry mr groening the best part facial expressions recommend multiple viewings with some cool tunes good friends and a couple of cold ones,1
this film could be one of the most underrated film of bollywood history this 1994 blockbuster had all of it good performances music and direction i remember i was in allahabad when this movie was running and it was somewhere in march at holi time the people there were playing its song ooe amma at their loudspeakers in highest volume if someone who likes to watch some like it hot and drools over marilyn monroe he should see this movie thumbs up to govinda how many of you know that this film was shot in south of india and after sholay could be one of the very few blockbuter to hit silver screen with films like these indian comedy could never be dead,1
it's a very good movie not only for the fans of lady death comics but also for those who like animated movies series of adventure and fantasy br br the film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadn't done but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell lucifer himself br br then she seeks revenge and the rest you better see it from the movie br br i liked the movie a lot the characters are like the original comics form chaos i never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics only the last ones after the passages in the movie so i cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics but one way or another it's the story of lady death,1
the first episode set the bar quite high i thought it starred william hurt as a hit man who is contracted to kill a toymaker we are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business but he is in for a night of hell the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war driving jeeps shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters the special effects are good for a tv show and it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not i wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist this gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one stephen king adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception,0
this is a strange sex comedy because there s very little comedy but a whole lot of sex most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so graphic it makes basic instinct look like an edition of teletubbies i kid you not the sex in this film is so in your face it might just choke you especially if you re watching with your grandparents br br as for the rest of rita sue and bob too there s not much else worth mentioning except the language where every single sentence seems to contain the f word this a rather bleak hyper realist british film made at a time when channel 4 was the main investor in british movies which explains its made for television low budget feel,0
worst bob hope comedy ever and that includes some heavy competition hope on an island with sailors dreams aloud of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl steering his ship somebody certainly steered this hope hackery over the cliff as it features phyllis diller and gina lollobrigida and still can't work up any laughs or excitement where's bing crosby when you really need him,0
this is probably my favorite movie of all time it is perfection in its storytelling it will break your heart not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time,1
what was this about pre destination you can not change the future cause it has already been written br br i'll give it this much i did want to see what happened next and therefore watched the whole movie this movie took a concept and made it watchable br br if you're looking for a recommendation see it at matinee prices no thrills but an interesting concept they should have left the y2k reference out,0
i think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words clueless and appalling nonsense i think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment one has to suspend one's disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love have a child and live together happily ever after but it is always wonderful to see it played out in a movie and have one's heart warmed is it so impossible there are far more implausible events described in other movies the acting is good the script is funny the only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family drives away from its initial house instead of extending on to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality,1
the title says it all tail gunner joe was a tag given to the senator which relied upon the ignorance of the public about world war ii aircraft the rear facing moving guns relied upon a latch that would prevent the rear gunner from shooting off the tail of the airplane by preventing the gun from firing when it pointed at the tail when the senator was practicing on the ground one day he succeeded in shooting off the tail of the airplane he couldn't have done that if the gun had been properly aligned the gunnery officer responsible for that admitted in public before a camera that he was responsible he had made the error not the senator the fact that the film did not report that fact shows how one sided it is this film was designed to do one thing destroy the reputation of a complex person br br a much better program was the pbs special done on him he was a hard working intelligent ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages to rise to extraordinary heights he made some mistakes some serious mistakes but shooting the tail off an airplane was not one of them br br the popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public likes simple stories one sided stories so that they don't have to think,0
am i missing something here unexpected plot developments plot twisting with subversive glee are these viewers watching the same arquette vehicle to which i just subjected myself in an now obvious sub un conscious bout of sadomasochism i just joined this site simply to make sure that no one else ever rents this stinker this movie was an embarrassment to every single person involved quick question did sir stevie read the script before he gave the thumbs up to kate c if so then it must be the same spielberg who greenlighted howard the duck don't give me that it was a hit play crap i'm guessing mssr reddin ain't too pleased the dvd cover promised surprising corners and a twisted story story story it's crap like this that make old bobby mckee and his wandering band of structuralists sound like geniuses sundance berlin toronto i have a home video of my cat farting that evokes more interest than arquette's negatively dimensional portrayal of anguished loss and talk about deux ex machina for mr stanley t thank god just in the nick o time he thought to have dave call the cops and thank shiva that the cops had just caught the true killer what up until the credits i was still waiting for it to be some kind of grift against arquette and his hidden millions no mrs spielberg you don't escape unscathed what the hell was that kitchen scene with the athlete's foot in my crotch gag are you worse in this or just cause i dunno hey film lovers why don't you make it a blockbuster night and rent this along with jersey girl and white chicks and then commit sepukka or is it seppuka and take e dunsky with you,0
of all the versions of the odyssey or of any greek mythological story for that matter this in my opinion is the best of them all almost true to the original storyline with some minor deviations and omissions e g the absence of scylla charybdis and the fact that eumaeus the swineherd recognizes odysseus in disguise in his hut realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece not some hollywoodish sword and sandal b flick notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in italian if one is familiar with the storyline he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying provided you have a good handy text of the odyssey at hand at least i did and so much so that it has inspired me to study the italian language to better appreciate the movie even more,1
this film is so unbelievable the whole premise is bunkum the fact that a serial killer vampire or otherwise could fly around untraced and kill as many people as the film implies is laughable the vampire himself would not look out of place in a bela lugosi film most of the acting is so wooden the actors should be treated for dry rot i await the day when someone makes a decent film from a steven king novel with the exception possibly of stand by me this film suffers from what most stephen king films do lack of money used for the special effects poor actors appalling characterisation and dialogue this film is cheap tacky and fails in everything it tries to do,0
this movie is poorly conceived poorly acted and poorly written br br jon heder is terribly annoying and cannot escape the same napolean dynamite routine self obsessed and ignorant br br furthermore diane keaton plays the same manish overly obsessed mother who cares too much and yet not nearly enough about the lives of her children see because i said so br br anna faris though i generally like her plays a vapid idiot in this film as well br br jeff daniels is passable but nothing special br br please skip this film if you want to keep your soul,0
i can't believe it that was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i laughed a couple of times probably because of how stupid it was if someone paid me to see that movie again i wouldn't the plot was so horrible it made no sense and the acting was so bad that i couldn't even tell if they were trying that movie was terrible rating f,0
americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial we tend to lose interest really fast br br i found out an exciting fact from this film someone has to paint high tension utility poles and do it on a schedule and guess what they really would like to be doing something else the viewer has similar feelings br br surprisingly when i was bored watching late night infomercials and decided to actually watch this film i found the characters to be interesting and highly engaging br br i just don't usually watch that much late night tv so i can't recommend this film unless watching paint dry is your idea of an exciting two hours out of your life,0
first off this movie was a wild ride the whole way the story of the training of the soldiers fighting with their superiors and in the end grouping together br br from the very beginning to the very end this is one war drama worth seeing if you are in for the constant cussing at times beyond reason and the horrors of what boot camp are br br the dynamics of how the actors interacted was quite amazing at times and sometimes humorous how bozz colin farrel deals with paxton matthew davis throughout the storyline from camp to tigerland and even in the end helping him br br the innovative free hand filming did add a certain taste or flavor to the film constant moving constant action and just constant confusion at times it was a help others not so much br br throughout the film it was increasingly realistic some points in the film the sex scenes in particular seemed to be just a tad too realistic even though they added an effect to the movie that wouldn't have been there without them it was a very gritty movie through and through br br in my opinion this is one of colin farrel's better movies if not his top performance the acting for every character was superb 9 10 sysnuk3r,1
philip k dickian movie and a decent one for that matter better than the paycheck woo and that abomination called minority report spielberg but lets face it the twisting and cheesing ending was a bit too much for me half way through the movie i already started to fear about such kind of ending and i was regrettably right but that does not mean that the film is not worth its time no not at all first half as already many here have commented is awesome there are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that showmanship is highly important thing in the future we will do such kind on corny sf things because we can or is it simply over combining but the paranoia is there and feeling out of joint also good one,0
this night listener is better than people are generally saying it has weaknesses and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis no doubt but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this the whole thing feels like one of those fireside this happened to a friend of a friend of mine ghost stories one big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility and real life just sort of plods alongno so there are no flashy endings or earth shattering revelations no showdown scenes thank heaven you have to get into the zone when watching this movie forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a conventionally good movie williams isn't terrific but he easily meets the needs of the story plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic no one as he is the everyman the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story toni collette's performance should be nominated for an oscar even if she maybe shouldn't win it give it a shot for quality and content alone the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days,1
jim carrey rocks if he's in a movie its bound to be good he did not disappoint me with this one the rest of the cast was cute especially little cindy lou who and martha may i was laughing through the whole thing and cannot wait to see it again,1
i realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title this movie is not primarily about the act of riding giants but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport riding giants to change the emphasis br br in my teens i lived a block from the wedge one of the hardest breaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world i've been out in 15 to 18 foot surf and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12 foot waves on many occasions that experience is why i am in complete awe of the surfers in this film the idea that jeff clark to all appearances a normal mortal could get away with riding maverick's by himself for over a decade is beyond my grasp the first safety rule of any water sport is never surf dive swim by yourself he went where sane people would not and lived to tell about it i wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left br br in the world of warm water the first shot of the waves at jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body these are not just scary waves these are uncontrolled bowel evacuation waves when we see laird hamilton not only surviving 40 to 60 foot waves i can hardly type those numbers but actually working the faces like a fun day at rincon i'm blown away there is a dedication and focus in big wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world br br this a great film i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it neglects to mention that there are great big wave riders in the world outside the hamilton kalama crew and i think they deserved mention splice in ken bradshaw at outside log cabins and a 10 it is,1
i think i laughed twice the line where the main character says something about being from the streets and then i forget the other time i laughed it was probably in the beginning br br this has to be one of the thinnest movies ever doesn't hollywood realize that this kind of humor is degrading and sad really you can only insult yourself so many times br br 2 10,0
rene clair's groundbreaking musical if you want to see where songs first drove a story this is the place this is the story of a starving young artist who finds he's won the lottery just as his creditors come calling unfortunately his ticket is in his coat which is in his girlfriends apartment and has been given to an on the run convict who then oh but that would be telling br br this is a light and frothy story where much of the dialog is sung most people think this didn't happen until oklahoma or andrew lloyd webber its the sort of movie that they don't make any more and rarely did when they did its sound a film from the early days that plays like a movie from five or six years later clair moves his camera around in ways that not even busby berkeley was doing though to be honest comparing the two film makers is unfair since berkeley was doing essentially stage bound dance numbers and clair was moving the camera through the real world its an amazing little movie and its a charming movie that will just make you smile its just a fluffy piece of enjoyment br br i'm sorry i can't say more its just a nice little movie and thats really all you need to know,1
houseboat horror is often regarded as the worst australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher film which carried the promotion 'see the movie that can't get an academy award' an underground disco band members begins to die slashed to death by burned maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the australian outback badly acted and written slasher flick with zero suspense and annoying characters it certainly delivers the gore heads are split in half with a machete throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe if you like cheesy slasher movies you can give this one a try but you have been warned at least it's better than swedish the bleeder 4 out of 10,0
i rented this for my son who is recently found interest in 9 11 he was a kindergartener at the time and had no idea what was unfolding i liked the way it was told as a documentary if there was one movie that i would recommend to see concerning 9 11 this would be the one normally you see a movie it has actors that are well known this movie had nobody known also you see a movie concerning 9 11 you hear about a fire fighter or two losing their lives saving people i didn't feel this had any of that i only rented this movie and would definitely consider adding it to my collection very well done indeed my heart goes out to the survivors and families of victims of 9 11,1
the world is made up two different types of moviegoers there are the english patient types who can't be bothered to enjoy anything that isn't high brow enough to be shown on pbs and there are the happy gilmore types for whom an hour and a half of genitalia puns are definitely worth the 7 br br certainly there's a ton of gray area but you know to which side you're leaning if you're an english patient person save your time save your money and save us all your oh this movie is so childish and stupid comments i know you thoroughly enjoy belittling every movie you don't like and every person that likes them but maybe you could hold off just this once br br but if you're a happy gilmore type go see this one you'll find it hilarious tim meadows has created a hilarious character and will farrell continues to be hilarious in just about everything he does go check it out you'll be glad you did and that's ok,1
the cat's meow contains a few scenes that boast intelligent dialogue and some fine performances a few of which surprised me eddie izzard is more effective than i expected as chaplin partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer joanna lumley is compelling as novelist elinor glyn and kirsten dunst is winning as marion davies though why movies never use her real life stutter is difficult to explain but these elements don't add up to a successful whole the screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes the meetings between davies and chaplin are particularly well crafted but not so hard on the big picture several minor characters don't need to be there and don't behave consistently the basic plot is full of illogic e g why does thomas ince think it's a good idea to tell hearst something he really doesn't want to hear and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome i'd like to think a trip on hearst's yacht was more fun than the movie indicates davies is characterized as a standard bubbly flapper type which isn't really accurate and the screenwriter's ideas about chaplin and love are implausible br br strangely bogdanovich who seemed so connected to the thirties in paper moon lacks a similar affinity for the twenties he insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream which gives the party guests a very artificial look and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period e g yes we have no bananas when hearst insists everybody charleston charleston it looks as if the actors had a ten minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot br br the lives of silent film stars can make fascinating movies i'm sure but not this time,0
how can the viewer rating for this movie be just 5 4 just the lovely young alisan porter should automatically start you at 6 when you decide your rating james belushi is good in this too his first good serious role i hadn't liked him in anything but about last night until this he was pretty good in gang related with tupac also kelly lynch you gotta love her well i do i'm only wondering what happened to miss porter br br i gave curly sue a 7,1
worth watching twice because of the rapid paced causal shifts among several compelling stories bug emerges as a wholly satisfying work of art that plays ever optimistic love against myriad examples of frustrating reality br br my favorite characters are wallace john carroll lynch whose overriding concern for life from that of a cockroach to the airline passengers for whom he is partially responsible frames the film olive christina kirk who spends considerable time creating surreal but tasty meals for her impossible husband ernie chris bauer and mitchell a cable tv technician with unbounded trust in fortune cookie messages you will meet the girl of your dreams br br against such optimism are the forces of quirky reality all generated by actions of the characters parking tickets a clogged drain in a chinese food donut shop tv disruption a crushed auto fender an obliterated dinner reservation that eventually results in cancellation of a hawaiian vacation br br the film is funny olive getting drunk at a chippendale performance johnston michael hitchcock as a customer service rep attempting to deal with an irate customer the germ obsessive cyr brian cox facing a restaurant inspector dwight jamie kennedy reacting to his girlfriend's refusal to have children by writing hostile chinese cookie fortunes your girlfriend is lying to you and the guy who falls asleep while manning a jackhammer because he spent the night looking for his girlfriend's missing cat br br a minor story with public cable access host darryl theirse and a local acting teacher reading from the boy in the bubble expresses the major theme love comes from the heart br br bug entertains on much the same level as trains planes and automobiles but on a lower budget and with a fresher eye,1
i remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and had been wanting to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now i knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day we rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare wasn't necessary the only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main characters' first name the fact that there is a bet and a whole lot of worm eating oh yeah i almost forgot the kid who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent how the kids know each other the number of kids involved how the bet came about the number of worms that must be eaten the time frame in which he has to eat the worms how they are cooked progression of friendships climax scenes etc nothing is the same but somehow it did not ruin the movie for me the characters are all enjoyable and the film did not leave me disappointed word of caution for parents there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively draw their breath and that was when billy's little brother referred to his penis as a dilly dick the embarrassing part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us does anybody know what a dilly dick is lol that and an occasional shut up is as foul mouthed as this film gets my daughter thought she might get sick around worm 3 and 4 and was holding the empty nacho container just in case but was fine by worm 6 she and i both really enjoyed the film and had a wonderful time sharing the experience,1
otto preminger directs this light as a feather story bohemian jean seberg and her equally bohemian widower father david niven holiday in the south of france with nutty mylène demongeot things are fine until family friend deborah kerr shows up nivens a degenerate womanizer finds the conquest of kerr too hard to resist that's fine with seberg as long as niven loves her and leaves her as he's done with all the women in his past including demongeot when it appears as though she's becoming second banana in niven's life seberg exact revenge on kerr preminger tells the story in flashbacks from seberg's perspective and cleverly combines black and white with sunnier color scenes the cinematography by georges périnal is stunning the film features some of preminger's least heavy handed direction although he rarely allows any close ups which makes it difficult to make out what the actors are really feeling arthur laurents wrote the script and it's full of acidic dialog and funny scenes mostly involving bird brained demongeot seberg acquits herself fairly well but niven is at his least appealing and he shows no chemistry with either seberg or kerr preminger really mis steps with that casting it's a role that seems tailor made for someone closer to charles boyer with geoffrey horne as seberg's would be suitor and martita hunt as his daffy mother juliette gréco playing herself sings the title song in a paris nightclub the great titles are by preminger regular saul bass,0
merry madcaps in london stage a treasure hunt with one young woman inadvertently fixing up her married politician father with a strong independent lady flier who's never been in love intriguing early vehicle for katharine hepburn playing an amelia earhart like aviatrix who's been too self involved to give herself over to any man the director dorothy arzner and the screenwriter zoe akins who adapted gilbert frankau's book were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view but why are all the old clichés kept intact like frozen artifacts billie burke plays the type of simpering weepy wife who takes to her bed when thing go wrong and hepburn's final scene is another bummer a curious artifact but not a classic for kate watchers from,0
this movie is the best movie ever it has a lot of live action it's just great everyone should watch it and the actor are great the location is rome italy thats the best place ever the actors are great mary kate olsen is such a great actress she plays charlie and thats a great character and ashley olsen play leila and thats a great character to love when in rome love it,1
fast paced funny sexy and spectacular cagney is always terrific blondel charms you with her wit and energy it's obvious that this is a pre censorship film by the innuendo in the script the costumes and the way they touch each other and bikinis before there were bikinis this is no holds barred fun for everyone i don't understand the john garfield issue though does it matter whether or not he's in this film if he is he screen is so short that he's basically a prop you need to watch it frame by frame to even find him if he's there i'm a big cagney fan but had never seen this one before i found it on turner classics i found it by wonderful accident sit back and enjoy the ride,1
a strangely enjoyable effort combining an appropriately far fetched plot involving adam and burt and flashbacks to the original tv series most of the flashback scenes were lifted directly from burt ward's book boy wonder my life in tights and i imagine his book was the inspiration for making this movie like the book it left fans of the original series hungering for more br br if you missed this broadcast it is definitely worth the effort to borrow a tape from a friend who may have recorded it i'm making a copy for my kids right now,1
i remember watching this film a while ago and after seeing 3000 miles to graceland it all came flooding back why this hasn't had a video or dvd release yet it's sacrilegious that this majesty of movie making has never been released while other rubbish has been in fact this is the one john carpenter film that hasn't been released in fact i haven't seen it on the tv either since the day i watched it kurt russell was the perfect choice for the role of elvis this is definitely a role he was born to play john carpenter's break from horror brought this gem that i'd love the tv to play again it is well acted and well performed as far as the singing goes belting out most of elvis's greatest hits with gusto i think this also was the film that formed the partnership with russell and carpenter which made them go on to make a number of great movies escape from new york the thing big trouble in little china and escape from l a someone has got to release this before someone does a remake or their own version of his life which i feel would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the magic that this one has if this doesn't get released then we are gonna be in heartbreak hotel,1
this is the best version so far that you will see and the most true to the bronte work dalton is a little tough to imagine as rochester who jane eyre declared not handsome but his acting overcomes this and zelah clark pretty as she is is also a complete and believable jane eyre this production is a lengthy watch but well worth it nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true 'romance' in literature this is the way to see it i own every copy of this movie and have read and re read the original the filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this,1
that's a snippet of choice dialogue delivered by the evil ballbusting lady assistant of a famous scientist to her prim maid just before she lures three incredibly dumb college girls to a mansion for behavior modification experiments meanwhile at the local bar people drink and dance to lame 80s rock songs a biker punk has sex with a cycle slut on a pinball table in front of a crowd of people then tries to rape the scientist's virginal daughter jessica debra hunter who is in love with another biker dale midkiff from pet sematary who in turn is in cohorts with the assistant back at the house the sorority bimbos swim shower change clothes and have sex with men from the bar a small silver ball part of the experiment flies into victims mouths and turns them into drooling killer zombies br br if that isn't enough to entertain you there's a hilarious theme song nightmare fantasy roller skating some serious daisy dukes and a psychic hand puppet that warns danger danger just like the lost in space robot and recommends hitchhiking as one of the best ways to pick up men br br this filmed in florida mess is so mind numbingly awful that multiple viewings are recommended to soak it all in and hey isn't that nypd blue's detective jill kirkendall turned cnn newscaster andrea thompson as one of oft nude bimbos sure is supposedly this was started in 1982 and new footage was added later for the video release in 1985 br br score 1 out of 10 and i mean that in a good way,0
this is just a great fun lovely film it captures the true essence of the decade and of the people and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters with two sailors though this film may only be in black and white it definitely doesn't count against it now in modern days the main basic purpose of the movie is timeless this movie features great acting beautiful song and dance numbers and great design work and film shots follow the fleet is also comical there are funny moments moments that will make you laugh but other moments where the acting just gets you so involved into the storyline its amazing how though this movie may be set in a certain decade how it can affect those today if you want to see something great check this out,1
not a bad film somehow i was made to actually root for the iranians to win the game played in the movie even though i don't know anything about soccer and am not a fan the ending on the bus was exhilarating br br the film itself deals with the issue of women in iran and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear despite this law some women try to sneak in but many of them get caught and detained it's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender in an interview panahi says his films are documents of history and its injustices and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how iran once lived one hopes that future will come sooner rather than later,1
everyone knows about this ''zero day'' event what i think this movie did that elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were they showed their life for about a year throughout the movie we get to like them to laugh with them even though we totally know what they're gonna do and that gives me the chills cause i felt guilty to be cheered by their comments and i just thought cal was a sweet guy even though i knew what was gonna happen you know even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of 3 or 4 i thought this was funny but still i was horrified to see their heads blown off of course i was i got to like them they were wicked maybe but i felt like they were really normal guys that they didn't really realize it but i knew they were br br that's imo the main force of this movie it makes us realize that our friends or relatives or anyone can be planning something crazy and that we won't even notice it this movie as good as it was made me feel bad and that's why i can't go to sleep right now there's still this little feeling in my stomach butterflies,1
williamson's accent is tough to wade through he speaks incredibly quickly like he is in a rush to get through the lines during the soliloquies he acts as if he is talking to someone when he is supposed to be talking to himself all that and his bald spot just annoyed me he was just too old for this role in reading other accounts of williamson maybe he got this role because he was mad and the director decided to do a bit of life imitates art or forced method acting when the actors declare hamlet mad you believe it marianne faithful is a stunning beauty and could botch the role of ophelia and still get a pass the set is dark and foreboding but it does look as if shot in a real castle especially the scenes in the tunnels corridors where the dead king shines as a great light in the sky,0
wow this one sucks i'm gonna sum it up as quickly as possible   br br a count invites 4 naive sluts back to his castle a bunch of nothing happens for a long time some lame and un erotic soft core sex scenes happen some girls get their heads cut off off screen the end br br the only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue and a few brief nudie shots and believe me those things are not enough to redeem the 90 minutes of tedium that this film is in fact the best part is the tacked on beginning from the distributor that features some slutty goth chicks covered in blood and showing their tits and again this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this garbage as everyone else has noted the title of the film is completely nonsensical as there's absolutely no bloodsucking nor dancing of any sort in the film at all it may as well have been called 'the goat raper leads the circle jerk' and at least then it would have had a better title that also pertains to nothing in the film an accurate title would have been '90 minutes of torture' another alluring title that would have at least been truthful for the viewer honestly the trailer that's on the disc shows all the best parts and i use the term 'best' extremely loosely so i highly suggest watching that instead if you're still curious  i can't imagine anyone liking this wreck of a film please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf 2 10 ,0
i will never forget this film or the events that lead up to jonestown in guyana it just seems so tragic but needs to be told powers boothe give a commanding performance as the leader rev jim jones from obscurity until total madness it would have won him an academy award easily if it was released in the movie theaters it is the kind of mini series you won't forget you won't forget the images of the cult's brutality control and obsessiveness of it's leader his rise and fall and the threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered to be paradise the mass suicide is horrifying almost unreal to anybody's imagination as to why so many people 900 went willingly or resisted jones' orders they don't make mini series like these anymore where we're left with out mouths open and hungry to know what happened to the others,1
this production has absolutely no storyline the acting is embarrassing the promising dutch television sophie hilbrand star should not add this movie to her cv her acting is far from flawless and personally i think she has crossed boundary of professional decency relating to the way she exposes herself in this movie this movie contains too much unnecessary nudity vulgar sexual scenes and rude language it also shows a wrong image of the netherlands as most movies do do not bother to watch this movie a waste of time a waste of money and an embarrassing record for hilbrand who has proved to be better with her close on on the screen,0
this musical is decidedly mixed and none of the elements really fit together but it somehow manages to be mostly enjoyable the plot contains some of the elements of wodehouse's novel but none of its virtues though he co wrote the script the songs though charming have nothing to do with this particular film and are unusually crudely squeezed into the plot even by pre oklahoma standards burns and allen do their usual shtick quite competently but it misses the tone of the rest of the film by about forty iq points br br there are a few high points reginald gardiner does good work when he remembers that this is a talkie and stops mugging like a silent actor and there are a few bits of writing which could only have been written by wodehouse though most of the film feels like the production of one of the hollywood meetings he later parodied,1

had this film been put together a tad better it would be up there with the best of astaire and rogers as it is it's a fine movie but overly long with a tedious subplot i e randolph scott romancing rogers' sister played by harriet hilliard that's ozzie nelson's wife to you baby boomers br br astaire and scott are two navy men scott meets hilliard the first time when she looks like a stereotypical librarian and later on after ginger rogers has asked her friend a blond but unmistakable lucille ball to glamor her up meanwhile astaire tries to pick up where he and his old dancing partner left off the result is some wonderful dance numbers with astaire and rogers as a team as well as separately i'm putting all my eggs in one basket let yourself go and i'd rather lead the band hilliard is sweet but a little lethargic as a plain jane turned glamor girl although she sings her two songs well but where are you and get thee behind me satan one poster didn't care for that song but i love the title rogers is vivacious and a youthful astaire is a dynamo br br the highlight of the movie comes at the end with let's face the music and dance one of the most achingly beautiful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliantly executed by rogers and astaire in it they epitomize '30s glamor and fantasy it is truly to be treasured and watched again and again,1
i had to write a review of this film after reading another comment saying that this is sidney poitier's best movie poitier had just returned from over a decade's break in film acting and he is clearly creaky here 11 of his films are mentioned in wikipedia and they don't include this 5 of his films are on the afi's list of top 100 inspiring movies again not including this berenger and poitier rube and city slicker set out to hunt down a dangerous psychopath before he crosses the border to canada some of the attempts at comedy in this film clearly fail and berenger and poitier's bonding was cringeworthy and awkward not helped by a completely bland script kirstie alley as the hostage was underused and almost entirely ignored when she was on screen some attempt at suspense is made for example when you're meant to try and guess which of 5 men on a fishing trip is the murderer all of them are type cast villains i understand that this is the entire appeal to most fans out there i guessed who it was and i wasn't really trying hard br br if you're a berenger fan watch the sniper 1993 you even get to see billy zane strutting his stuff it's much better all in all i'd give shoot to kill 3 10 it's not daring and it's just too straightforward for me,0
my life is about saving animals i do volunteer work with a cat rescue organization i am a vegetarian because i couldn't kill an animal even to sustain my life i can't even kill a spider i put it outdoors the scene where the children throw rocks at the bird until it dies with sooner participating in an attempt to be accepted by the other children made me sick and has haunted me ever since it simply convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance the ending the foster parents adopt sooner does not redeem the depiction of animal cruelty why would anyone want their child to see this film,0
just look at the poor robert webber character great performance once again who tries to wrestle a sub machine gun from one of the terrorists everything in this movie seems to be a little wrong the biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action a firm footing in the actuality of the early 1980ies the fundamental difference between this flick and the far more fantastic ironic and therefore timeless die hard the story comes through as a failed attempt to glorify the sas commandos ideas like when a commando shouts heads down all good guys do it and all bad guys don't so that they can blast away ad lib with a good conscience that the main character does not get mown down by the gas masked commandos although he wears the same clothes and carries a weapon from their arsenal just seem to be unlikely and make it hard to take the movie seriously and it just happens that it tries to be more than just fun don't talk about the toilet mirror signal episode br br i don't mind the criticism of the pacifist movement as a shield for evildoers and the arguments between the peace fanatics and the settled even headed representatives of power in this movie but the political comment is rather lame and uninspired this is insofar regrettable as the movie features an early performance of judy davies she plays the main fanatic and seems to have done extensive studies on the subject anyway her performance is a notch above that of the others and somehow i feel the movie let her down,0
let's be honest as a film school project made without budget and real actors this is a passably interesting film as something to be released on dvd for an innocent viewer it's a very poorly produced product if i would be idly changing channels and happened to catch this film accidentally it would probably arrest my eye and attention for a while as a person who bought this dvd under the impression that i would be getting a proper cinematic product i e a film i feel deeply disappointed it's a videotaped tv play something along the line of old sixties serials but without that certain charm aside from the leading man mr redfield who also is the director the other actors seem to be either chaps from the campus a bit too old for that actually or members of the director's household who appear before the camera without any help from not only the acting couches but also the make up artist or hairdresser a bonnet over outgrown permanent bangs or a top hat over mullet is a very long way from creating 1840s it's all shot using a motionless mounted camera in a small bare studio sometimes using blue screen for outdoors backgrounds synthesizer generated uninspired score of lame period inspired romantic karaoke insults the viewers ears on more than one occasion the film attempts to be dreamlike whereas in fact it's merely conceptionless collage of those shots that made it to the editing and believe me the standards weren't too high to start with there are interesting dialogs every now and then but overall it's pretty lame and two dimensional production in more than one way with no flashes of genius from either the director or any members of the crew that's how artsy films attempted to look in the 80s mr redfield does a much better job as an actor than the director,0
i haven't seen the original but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who happens to scroll down this far wicker man is the worst movie i've seen this year maybe even in two years i wish i could ask the theater for my money back or turn back time to warn myself not to see it br br i'll give it two positive nods the sarcasm of cage's character at least got some laughs from me and the scenery of the island was beautiful sorry that's it here come the jeers the movie's plot is only propelled forward because other characters won't give cage any straight answers and he puts up with this how this could go on for over an hour of my time much less days in the movie is beyond me br br not to mention that the plot is full of holes you leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library how anyone could read this script and think yes people should pay 11 to see this shady outline of what a film should look like is beyond me br br do not go see this flick or even rent it on dvd,0
as a popular sport surfing was liked by many people just after watched the documentary i realized how dangerous it could be in fact the surfers also scared of big waves even somebody got killed by it but they still kept on surfing and enjoyed themselves only brave people can do it br br according to what the surfers said we can clearly knew what they felt when the big wave came at them you have to adjust to your best and avoid direct strike from the big wave when you win it that will obviously bring you huge satisfaction br br the amazing cinematography cannot be overlooked that is absolutely visual enjoyment br br an excellent sports documentary 8 10,1

this film is exactly what its title describes an attempt to get you to buy into what the writers have to offer br br first it's kinda fun to see the 1996 style toronto i remember with all its silly haircuts sunglasses clothes and attitude it really hasn't changed any just a nice safe cheap provincial little urban backwater that makes a great meeting place for international film types it's also amusing to see kenny and spenny head to l a and find out that it's toronto all over again only with a strange assortment of beach bums musicians fortune tellers and yet more uppity film types br br i don't see pitch as a film to be enjoyed it's not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys watching someone's aspirations being trampled i take pitch as a warning that power and money is really held by studio execs and production houses would be and successful writers musicians and actors are still mere transients even when they reach the big time br br so kenny and spenny are trying to sell you a warning buy it or don't but the message is still there,1
cuban blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way i actually watched it while sailing around cuba on a western caribbean cruise it details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end when the socialist regime came and took the property of the boy's father the majority of the film is the boy's coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else there are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to a class a film with fine acting and directing this is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists it is a film about people and their lives their mistakes and their triumphs a good film worth watching several times annually,1
winchester 73 is the story of a man jimmy stewart obsessed with getting back his prized possession a repeating rifle made by winchester the rifle keeps changing hands and stewart doggedly keeps after it this 1950 b w effort by anthony mann is more a crime film than a traditional western and the cowboys often seem more like modern day gangsters than old fashioned cowboys shelley winters plays a woman of questionable virtue who is headed for a ranch with a man charles drake she may marry she ends up falling for stewart but not before she is passed around a bit winters is the most complex character in a film filled with unusual characters watch for a young dan dureyea as a nutty killer and tony curtis in a very small role a woefully miscast will geer plays wyatt earp,1
i frequently comment on the utter dirth of truly scary movies on the market and sadly white noise only served to reduce my faith that the film industry remains capable of such an endeavor i was surprised to find myself growingly increasingly fatigued as the plot wore on and my static induced headache increased i found white noise to be preposterous beyond our best efforts of suspension of disbelief even after witnessing the harrowing ordeal sustained by michael keaton i was totally unaffected by his demise up until the credits i diligently awaited for something anything of substance to connect me to the characters' story but such relief never came sure there were the occasional heart stopper moments but only because loud noises tend to do that to the dozing viewer br br while the acting was lame michael keaton may have played his studliest role to date perhaps the only redeeming quality that white noise has to offer is the stunning archietecture in both of keaton's abodes overall white noise leaves one with the morbidly depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three malicious shadows contriving to trick the living into following the dead to their own graves,0
any movie with national lampoon in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die a death in london england paris france rome italy and anywhere in germany it may be an institution in the u s but it is practically unknown in europe to the larger audience national lampoon's european vacation is unlikely to rectify that situation the appalling griswalds are just that appalling they are not funny clearly mr chevy chase thinks he's funny after all miss b di angelo laughs a lot at his jokes but she's getting paid for it and didn't have to fork out £2 50 for the privilege the section set in england is typical the same old same old tv performers messrs idle smith coltrane miss m lippman trot out the same old same old tired clichés mr chase gets lost in the hotel corridor yawn yawn yawn bucking ham palace big ben i feel cheated that we never saw bobbies on bicycles two by two rosie red cheeks on the little chil dren need i go on the english are buffoons the french vicious tongued yank haters the germans pompous and puffed up don't mention the war clark and the italians lecherous bottom pinchers have i forgotten anything every possible comic situation is worked to death mr chase gurns desperately miss di angelo dimples sweetly the children are embarrassingly bad the fact that this franchise ran as long as it did must bring comfort to those who propound that you never lose money by underestimating public taste,0
with no fault to the actors they all put on great performances the overall story was not very well executed the movie opens with a great zinger a crazy old guy forces a young aborigine girl's car off the road but then we're forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with an entirely new group of characters and we don't know why until the 40 minutes are up it turns out that they are the ones who eventually discover the girl's body and the story progresses from there br br while the story does pick up at that point it really goes nowhere after 2 hours i asked myself was there a point to this or was it just to see the characters struggle with accusations of racism and stupidity of how they handled the discovery the story was ultimately unsatisfying and felt unfinished while it is well acted there's not a strong enough backbone in the film to warrant recommending it,0
based on an actual mining disaster this early german talkie with english subtitles still remains one of the most effective docu dramas ever filmed featuring many non professional actors kameradschaft gives a chilling view of the friendship that binds the mine workers regardless of which side of the french german border they may be from a deadly accident brings out the very best in everyone nullifying any superiors' orders a fellow miner in need will receive the help of his comrades even at threat of great loss including life br br this film reminds of the self sacrificing heroism shown by the nyfd following the 9 11 attacks putting aside any formal rules and regulations these men and women in uniform knew only one cause to save lives and to find their fellow fire fighters more than 70 years later kameradschaft still has the strong and timeless message a friend in need is a friend in deed,1
this is a well directed film from john cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the 1937 version of 'the prsoner of zenda' set in a london that only hollywood could manage atmospheric but nothing like the real thing it is a story of obsession and thwarted love from the novel by somerset maughan br br i was looking forward to seeing it on dvd as i had never seen it before and being a great admirer of bette davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones so i bought it well she looked fine but i'm sorry to say her london cockney accent just made me laugh bette davis was one of the greatest film actors make no mistake but here she did make one it was impossible to take her character seriously it wasn't as gruesome as the dick van dyke 'mary poppins' cockney accent but close br br in the other major role was leslie howard and he did it superbly he was a subtle and intelligent actor the supporting actors acquit themselves well worth watching despite ms davis' vocal gymnastics,1
i can understand those who dislike this movie cause of a lack of knowledge br br first of all those girls are not geisha but brothel tenants and one that don't know the difference will not understand half of the movie and certainly not the end this is a complete art work about the women's life and needs in this era everything is important and certainly the way they dress all over the movie means more than words to those who thought it was a boring geisha movie i'll suggest you to read a bit about this society before making a conclusion that is so out of the reality this is kurosawa's work of is life and i'm sure that the director understood the silent meaning of kurosawa's piece to the right intellectual range,1
a give this movie a 10 10 because it deserves a 10 10 two of the best actors of their time walter matthau george burns collaborate with neil simon and all of the other actors that are in this film director herbert ross and all of that makes this stage adaption come true the sunshine boys is one of the best films of the 70's i love the type of humor in this film it just makes me laugh so hard br br i got this movie on vhs 3 days ago yes vhs because it was cheaper only 3 i watched it as soon as i got home but i had to watch it again because i kept missing a few parts the first time the second time i watched it it felt a lot better and i laughed a lot harder i'm definitely going to re get this on dvd because i have to see the special features br br it's very funny how that happens two people work together as entertainers actors performers they get along well on stage but really argue off stage they can't survive another minute with each other then some 15 years later you want to reunite them for a tv special you can find that in this film matthau burns were terrific in this film it's a damn shame they died george burns deserved that oscar he gave a strong comic performance he was also 78 when this movie was filmed so far he's the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age jessica tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress richard benjamin was also fantastic in this he won a golden globe for best supporting actor he deserved that golden globe although many people might disagree with what i am about to say everybody in this film gave a strong performance this comedy is an instant classic i highly recommend it one more thing whoever hates this film is a putz,1
a warning to potential viewers if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story the most dangerous game look elsewhere seven women for satan br br only superficially addresses the original work by using the name of zaroff and having said character murder people br br some of what follows might be considered by some to be spoilers or not br br boris zaroff is played by writer director michel lemoine whereas his ancestor hunted men because they were the only prey that were truly challenging boris' victims are usually in a position where they cannot defend themselves the film rambles from scene to scene with a near total lack of clarity the director seems to have totally disregarded pacing and left the viewer with a suffocatingly dull film a few individual scenes are mildly interesting such as a torture rack sequence but as a unit the film fails to entertain viewers who are more br br interested in an assortment of attractive and semi attractive actresses in various stages of undress might find the film watchable most will probably find their time is better spent watching mentos commercials br br in a side note the dvd extras included a fair amount of information on the film's history apparently it was banned for several years in its native france which pretty much ruined any chance it had for widespread distribution,0
my comments on this movie have been deleted twice which i find pretty offending since i am making an effort to judge this movie for other people please be tolerant of other people's opinion obviously writing in the spirit of nietzsches works is not understood so ill change my comment completely br br i think this is a really bad movie for several reasons br br subject one should be very careful in making a movie about a philosopher that is even today not understood by the masses and amongst peers brings out passionate discussions one thing philosophers do agree on is that nietzsche was a great thinker so making a movie about his life which obviously includes his 'ideas' is a thing one should be extremely careful with or preferably don't do at all wisdom starts with knowing what you don't know one might think this is not a review of the movie itself but the movie is not about an imaginary character it is about the life of someone who actually lived and had has great influence on the world of yesterday today and tomorrow if someone tells a story about a tomato i can express my thoughts about the story itself but also about the chosen subject the tomato there is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about actual facts specially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken br br screenplay one of the first things i noticed were the ridiculous accents why it distracts from what it should be about nietzsche and the truths he found it doesn't help putting things in a right geographical perspective or time come on make it proper english or better yet german even mel gibson got that part right letting his characters speak some gibberish aramaic in the passion br br secondly it is well over acted br br 3d assante is not an actor to depict nietzsche bad casting br br 4th facts are way off br br and so on its a waste of celluloid,0
a squashy slapstick mess posing as a comedy elvis presley plays an indian bull riding champ who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his folks' desert spread in arizona where government suits have just invested in the family's herd of cattle which is in dire need of a stud what director peter tewksbury is in dire need of is some narrative skills though what he lacks in assessment he makes up for in sloppy comedic montages his social commentary isn't exactly pointed but tewksbury does have a satiric bend to his outlandishness and there are some funny scenes despite colorful supporting turns by katy jurado and joan blondell the general wackiness gets way out of hand and there's too much hoopin' and hollerin' to sustain much interest as for elvis he's loose and frisky throughout and while it's nice to see him having fun on screen one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point this shambles of a picture has a distinct what the hell feel to it and though spirits are high the returns are mostly low 1 2 from,0
this waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great film nothing new or original is added other than perry's backflashes which are of marginal interest it lacks the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective also painfully missing is the sharp quincy jones soundtrack that added to much to the original film i can't understand any high ratings for this at all it's quite bad why does anyone waste time or money making crap like this and why did i waste time watching it,0
this is one of my all time favorite movies period i can't think of another movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this one does this flick has it all action adventure science fiction good vs bad and even some romance without even an innocent peck on the cheek between the pazu and sheeta maybe best of all you don't have to be in mensa to get it and enjoy the movie like you do with some of miyazaki's other movies i don't know about you but i watch movies to take a break from thinking this is just a flat out enjoyable movie that everyone will like so do yourself a favor and go buy it the only sour note is the american dubbing i found vander geek to be just plain annoying but all is not lost the original japanese version is on the two disc set and it rocks who cares if you can't understand spoken japanese if you can read at a second grade level then watch the original japanese recording with english subtitles you won't regret it,1
thoughtless ignorant ill conceived career killing where is the talented angela jones now deeply unfunny garbage it's no wonder reb braddock hasn't directed anything else since anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules based on his own script with the help of quentin tarantino himself and creates something like this anyone who feels that this was a story worth telling to the world doesn't deserve a second break under the circumstances the performances are good the actors do what they're told to do and they do it well it's just that they shouldn't have done it in the first place br br 0 out of 4,0
do we really need any more narcissistic garbage on the baby boomer generation technically i am a boomer though at the time when all the idealistic youths of the '60s were reading marx burning their draft cards and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives i was still in grade school but i remember them well and 9 out of 10 were just moronic fools who would believe anything as long as it was destructive br br this is just another excercise in self importance from the kids who never really grew up,0
'grey gardens' 1975 is the maysles' brothers bizarre documentary of jackie bouvier kennedy onassis'eccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down 28 room mansion on east hampton long island 'big edie' bouvier beale 78 witty and dry and her daughter 'little edie' beale 56 emotionally about 13 a still beautiful woman who once had a promising future live in isolation from the rest of the world except for their many cats and raccoons in the attic they amuse themselves by bickering all day listening to the radio or singing to each other they dont even own a television their fall from society is amazing to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two very special although obviously dysfunctional people one of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today,1
very rarely does denzil washington make a bad movie and come to think of it that goes for kevin kline and in this case this must count as one of their best films it is more about of film about how strong friendship can more than the story of steve biko although we do get an insight into what the man was like and how far the reporter and friend donald woods went to preserve the mans name and let the world know what a corrupt putrid society south africa was the direction is outstanding from david attenborough as it was for gandhi although if there is any critisism to be aimed it could be at the length of the film two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historic movie what is amazing is how he manages to control all the extras thousands of people in both films this film really does open your eyes to what happened before the break up of aparthiet and you cannot fail to moved by it 8 out of 10,1
mary pickford becomes the chieftain of a scottish clan after the death of her father and then has a romance as fellow commenter snow leopard said the film is rather episodic to begin some of it is amusing such as pickford whipping her clansmen to church while some of it is just there all in all the story is weak especially the recycled contrived romance plot line and its climax the transfer is so dark it's difficult to appreciate the scenery but even accounting for that this doesn't appear to be director maurice tourneur's best work pickford and tourneur collaborated once more in the somewhat more accessible 'the poor little rich girl ' typecasting pickford as a child character,0

the plot of goodnight mr tom on paper makes it seem we are in for a large dose of maudlin sickly sentiment but talented director jack gold is an expert on touching the emotions in the right manner and it emerges instead as a compelling deeply moving wartime drama with excellent production and lead performances one of the best if not the best tv movies of the 1990's which possibly would've had even greater success if it had been released in the cinemas br br the evacuation of children to countryside towns and villages in world war ii was of course a common practice but in the case of the young boy here was doubly important because of a wretched home life in the uk's capital the horrors of war on the home front are not drifted over though and the construction of the film until it's throat lumping misty eyed ending leaves us with a sense of optimism despite what has happened before it is almost but not quite worthy of comparison with the finale to it's a wonderful life 1946 all in all a modern classic,1

the movie is plain bad simply awful the string of bad movies from bollywood has no end they must be running out of excuses for making such awful movies or not br br the problem seems to be with mainly the directors this movie has 2 good actors who have proved in the past that the have the ability to deliver great performance but they were directed so poorly the poor script did not help either br br this movie has plenty of ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half for instance br br after his 1st big concert ajay devgan meets up with om puri from whom he ran away some 30 years ago and talked to again and all om puri finds to say is to beware of his friendship with salman what a load of crap seriously not to mention the baaad soundtrack whatever happened to shankar ehsaan loy br br ajay devgun is total miscast for portraying a rockstar br br only saving grace are the good performances in the second half ajay shines as his character shows his dark side so does salman as the drug addict br br watch it maybe only for the last half hour,0
well wayne's world is long gone and the years since then have been hard for snl off shoot movies from such cinematic offal as it's pat to the recent 80 minute yawn a night at the roxbury many have no doubt lost faith that any other snl skit will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen well fear not because tim meadows comes through in spades the well written plot maintains audience interest until the very end and while it remains true to the leon phelps character introduced in the five minute skit the storyline allows the character to develop the humor consisting largely of sex jokes is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than i have in any movie in recent memory its a just great time if you don't feel like taking yourself too seriously tiffany amber thiessen of saved by the bell fame makes an appearance in the film and looks incredible finally billy dee williams reliving his colt 45 days gives the movie a touch of class and for those out there who are mindless movie quoters like myself you will find this movie to be eminently quotable ooh it's a lady,1
this movie has the made for tv stink all over it though it started out with great intentions featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes the film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue and rushed tv sappy melodramatic acting the characters were so sappy that at times i thought that they are about to degenerate into a bilious puddle of goo and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another the germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to watch the only thing that the german officers talked about was how wonderful the americans are please take my word for this i am a huge fan of the war genre and this movie is crap nevertheless this dvd does have an excellent extra feature covering letters from the wwi front lines thus making this rental not a total waste of my time,0

william powell is a doctor dealing with a murder and an ex wife in the ex mrs bradford also starring jean arthur eric blore and james gleason it seems that powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed though he and myrna loy were the perfect screen couple the actor made a couple of other thin man type movies one with ginger rogers and this one with arthur both to very good effect br br somehow one never gets tired of seeing powell as a witty debonair professional and the ex mrs bradford is no exception the ex mrs b has mr b served with a subpoena for back alimony and then moves back in to help him solve a mystery that she's dragged him into and this isn't the first time she's done that it almost seems as though there was a bradford film before this one or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films mr b complains that his mystery writer ex is constantly bringing him into cases this time a jockey riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies right before the finish line br br the solution of the case is kind of outlandish but it's beside the point the point is the banter between the couple and the interference of the ex mrs b jean arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny however with an actress who comes off as brainy as arthur does the humor seems intentional rather than featherbrained i suspect the writer had something else in mind say the wacky side of carole lombard when arthur hears that the police have arrived she says ah it's probably about my alimony i've been waiting for the police to take a hand in it it's more of a rib to powell rather than a serious statement it still works well and it shows how a good actress can make a part her own br br definitely worth watching as william powell and jean arthur always were,1
i read thru most of the comments posted here all i can say it that most of these posters have major problems in life this show unlike most game show was fun mr shatner whose brill in all that he does was again the hit of the show he's genuinely bubbly personality shines like a beacon where ever he goes he's fun makes you smile that's exactly what the show does also the dancers questions the round about fashion they're presented only add to the shows appeal and even though there's a great deal of money at stake it's fun the pressure stress that exists in most game shows does not exist here several people who posted messages complained how much time is waisted with the dancers choosing questions c like millionaire doesn't have similar time wasters all i can say is most of you have missed the whole concept the idea here is to have fun enjoy yourself there's something for everyone qustions to test your knowledge eye candy the dancers suspense mr shatner's wonderful fun filled personality well if that doesn't perk up guys up then i feel bad for you and if that's not enough you can get rich i really miss the show out of all the games shows that have ever been on to be quite frank i hate game shows this is the one i really liked truly miss the only other game show i ever liked was match game,1
this was a great romantic comedy historically inaccurate einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in imdb but he made a great matchmaker he brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working the supporting cast lou jacobi joseph maher gene saks stephen fry etc all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience the fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around and did he wear socks in one scene reportedly the professor never wore socks two new entries for the imdb goofs section historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside this was a great movie to watch with a great cast i give it an 8,1
'blue desert' may have had the potential to be even a half way plausible and more enjoyable thriller had the main character lisa roberts courtney cox not been so stupid when she is the victim of another attack on the streets of new york comic book artist roberts moves to a small town out west in her first days there she meets the suspiciously crazy randall atkins craig sheffer playing this part well who will eventually not leave her side fearing for her safety after having been in the situation already twice before she strikes up a friendship and relationship with the suspiciously amicable town cop steve smith d b sweeny who's character does not seem convincing enough leaving disbelief among viewers who should otherwise be convinced of the red herrings thrown by the writers smith needs roberts cooperation because as he tells her atkins is an ex con and guilty of sexual assault but the cops have lacked the evidence to put him away before br br the movie had enough ploys to at least make an interesting movie because soon enough there is such confusion as to whom roberts should trust however much of the intended suspense appears too forced because roberts character never seems to react to simple things as we think any reasonable person might and her delayed responses allow much of that suspense to occur to easily and unconvincingly particularly in the finale perhaps sweeny was the wrong choice for this role too baby faced in ways that kind of recall kevin anderson's persona evident in his character in 'sleeping with the enemy ' or if lisa roberts was written as a stronger character this might suffice as well in the meantime the film is not all that great even as a low budget b thriller,0
with no affinity towards any type of filmmaking and a healthy appreciation of documentaries i can honestly say i was angry at myself for bothering to sit through the entire length of 20 dates i won't waste your time with the plot you may read other reviews i will say though that berkowitz's hyper woody allen style narration was extremely annoying you either wished he'd lay off the coffee or ingest some tranquilizers and it's potentially apparent to berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea as parts of it details his trials to finance the documentary forgive me for disguising insults as compliments but i'll give credit to berkowitz for having the skills to convince some idiot to finance this horrid piece of i appreciate the boundaries intentions of the film here but even when regarding the standards berkowitz sets for himself he fires off and misses on all levels in closing i'm sure many of these female companions were not at ease going on a date with a twitchy wanna be filmmaker and therefore i question the film's sense of authenticity hey myles i loved your film the first time i saw it when it appeared as an episode of seinfeld or was a film directed by woody allen or kevin smith,0
how this has not become a cult film i do not know i think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy br br runaway car attempts to pass itself off as a fast paced thriller but taking the quality of acting good god it's bad the storyline the practicalities of the car's demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh and laugh you will films are made to entertain us and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of a film's worth this film is the pinnacle in entertainment i laughed from beginning to end at one point i got short of breath and nearly choked it really is that funny at some points when the baby was airlifted out of the sunroof in a holdall by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant velocity identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the grapple hook didn't rip the car roof to pieces i was laughing hysterically but when the baby starting swinging around in the air nearly hit a bridge and almost got tangled up in a tree tears were running down my face br br it also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played jesus in madonna's like a prayer video he seems to get everywhere,1
i realize several ben stiller movies are out or will be out this year but perhaps he should insist on quality not quantity br br i was dumbfounded at what the filmmakers thought passed for comedy in along came polly br br stiller's reuben is grating charmless and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year stiller's schtick is getting tiresome he undoubtedly has comic talent but he needs to either find another schtick or take a break find some material that is actually funny because his movies are going from painfully humorless to excruciatingly bad br br there's absolutely no chemistry between stiller and jennifer aniston which is a shame because she's a good smart actress with a promising career as long as she keeps making more movies such as the good girl in which she's terrific and less like along came polly she'll have a career of which she could be proud br br aniston tries desperately to overcome the limp material with which she's working but it's a daunting task for any actress with the exception of a few moments with alec baldwin as reuben's boss stan and philip seymour hoffman as reuben's best friend sandy there's nothing funny in this awful film other supporting characters including debra messing as lisa and hank azaria as claude are annoying azaria's accent is not only stupid it's terribly unfunny br br the premise of along came polly certainly showed promise unfortunately it needed a writer who could actually turn it into a good comedy instead of this lame dull boring excuse for a comedy,0
no one is a greater fan of geroge macdonald fraser's flashman papers than i am br br i was surprised to see just now that richard lester directed royal flash since i also see he had made the three four musketeers with fraser which i though turned out rather well br br not so royal flash br br i was 12 years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since i had read all the flashman papers published up to that time and was intoxicated with a clockwork orange and malcolm macdowel i still am but he was never really given a chance after that br br what a disappointment i saw it once again when i was about 20 on television and it seemed even worse br br none of the sharp dialogue in the books is transfered to the screen the comedy of flashman's character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do the dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic br br looking back with more mature eyes the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the prisoner of zenda br br if you have read the book and not seen the film i can only say that the film ends with flashman and rudi von starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game rudi has just invented russian roulette br br a pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about br br my comments would be more direct if i had seen the film more recently but i am glad i have not br br if by any chance fraser ever reads this i can only say i think he is a genius perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation but based on my appreciation of that corpus of work it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film as that he did all those awful roger moore james bond films,0
i did enjoy this film i thought it ended up being an old fashioned love story with a few twists i expected him to get the girl i won't tell you if he does or not you will need to watch the movie to find out overall if you are looking to watch a love story this one will suffice,1
i know that in this episode there's other stuff apart from what i am going to discuss and in fact i think it has some virtues for example the fact after we had been given a very negative opinion of jin from seeing sun's flashbacks in house of the rising sun we get to see jin's side of things and get a new more balanced understanding of his life br br but there is an element in this story that made me so deeply uncomfortable that it greatly dampened my enjoyment of the whole episode before now in the scene where jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt it had been hinted that sun's father was someone who was getting rich through shady illegal methods i thought maybe he was a mob boss even mobs operate in korea just like in almost every other country in the world so it was a reasonable possibility however in this episode we learn that sun's father is in fact the boss or a top executive of a korean automotive company and that what jin had been doing was physically attacking a government official who was actually going to be murdered on his behalf br br i may be especially touchy about this because i happen to work in the automotive industry but i would say it is spectacularly offensive and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing goes on in korea that huge serious companies like hyundai or kia which must be the model for this fictitious car company as they are the only ones that actually exist in reality operate with these mafia like methods instead of like any normal automotive company of the west it is just unbelievable to me that the writers would have the gall to write something like that into the story and that there hasn't been an uproar in korea over it it feels like extraneous buy american propaganda portraying foreign car companies as criminal untrustworthy third world outfits,0
ice age is not only animation of the year in my eyes it's also the best animated feature i've ever seen br br the teaser excited me last year and i've spent many happy hours on the website scrat is cool and so are the rest of the sub zero heroes br br the animation is superb your heart really goes out to the characters in this film they have good lines of dialogue and are well developed it's hard to say which one really steals the picture br br i experienced their journey with laughter tears and amazement nothing was forced or over done the emotion was genuine especially in the dramatic second half the last film to affect me this deeply was anastasia in 1997 also a fox production and before that it was the land before time 1988 all possess real charm and seek to entertain all the audience not just the cynics 10 10 br br,1
i saw shiner on dvd while i was watching it i thought this is a really bad porn flick without the porn i also thought whoever wrote this has some real issues then i watched the director writer carlson explain his process as a special feature yeah it was real special br br the emphasis of the film is placed on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get off they are marginally attractive there is frontal and full nudity these factors probably account for the film being seen at all br br the most upsetting element of the film is the gay bashing and the subsequent further gay bashing of the same victim who tries ineptly to exact revenge from his assailants the two drunken losers not only is the subject handled absurdly and badly from a technical point of view but the acting is horrendously bad br br then there's the boxer stalker theme this is really insane not just absurd this hunky boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attentions of a fleshy momma's boy who works at his gym's parking lot this is in la mind you the boxer is so traumatized that he turns up at the stalker's house strips in front of him and gets excited in the process br br well all i can say is why would a boxer who is at heart an exhibitionist be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker it simply makes no sense and i'm afraid some psycho dynamics actually do make sense if you take the time to read about them however bad scripts seldom make sense at all br br the director writer seems to have thought that this film represents a considerable minority within the gay community well he may be correct i suppose we may never know since that minority would be so dysfunctional they would hardly be able to get organized enough to ever get to an obscure gay film festival or dvd store the only two places they could possibly find this turkey thank goodness for that,0
any way the wind blows is tom barmans who is also know as front man of the rock formation 'deus' debut movie entirely shot in antwerp belgium the movie starts on a sunny friday morning and skips rather superficially between the events that fill the day of a dozen of main characters when the movie ends you have a lot of stuff to think about because most of the different story lines are left wide open br br the movie has a purely instrumental sound track that will rock your socks off in most scenes the music truly enhances the general atmosphere and feel really making the movie hallucinating to watch at certain points of time the main scene in the film the party is very well shot br br the director didn't hesitate to use video clip techniques having his main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks i've heard lately br br the screenplay is great stuff camera angles and colors are very well chosen the 'costumes' are very hot and very 'seventies' too and i loved most of the acting br br the thing i liked most about the movie are the subtle touches of absurd surreal very dry or even cynical humor that interleave br br without claiming to be a comedy this movie certainly is not a comedy but rather an alternative piece of art it still manages to have its audience giggling and even burst into laughter at some times br br this is one more directors' debut that shouldn't be an ending i hope to see more tom barman movies in the future because i had a good time cheers,1
greetings again from the darkness much anticipated twisted comedy from writer director richard shepard is a coming out party for pierce brosnan the actor that bond guy is gone this new guy is something else entirely have read that shepard thought brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role but brosnan proves to be the perfect julian noble facilitator and is anything but pretty do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one if you go expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex killing religion sports business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements even sitting on a hotel bed with or without a sombrero is a joy to behold br br greg kinnear is the straight guy to brosnan's comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click hope davis has a small but subtly effective supporting role as kinnear's wife what's with her name bean who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living room br br the visuals and settings are perfect including a bullfight racetrack and denver suburb and how often do we get the killers and xavier cugat on the same soundtrack this one is definitely not for everyone but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you enjoy risky film making it could be for you,1
we know from other movies that the actors are good but they cannot save the movie a waste of time the premise was not too bad but one workable idea interaction between real bussinessmen and russian mafia is not followed by an intelligent script,0
it wasn't good the characters were underdeveloped and the only personality were from the memories i had of the previous movie which contrasted with the 'new' personalities or lack thereof i seriously thought the opening scene was a nightmare by ariel because of how absurd it was it was serious it just reminded me of all the annoying characters on the disney channel everyone is hyperactive and the story jumps from action to embarrassing scenes without any really connection br br the most disappointing part was the horrible songs not catchy not amazing in the original ariel had an amazing and powerful voice and all the song are catchy and fun you remember them and want to sing them but the songs in this movie weren't creative in the least it's as if they're talking in a annoying sing song voice quite weakly disappointing i don't have that want to sing them feeling you normally get from a disney movie br br it's as if not one wanted to do this movie so they barely made an effort this movie would needs a new story line new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without the annoying look at me look at me i'm so annoying mentality of this generation of disney ',0
in my opinion october sky is one of the best movies of 1999 it totally has everything an emotional drama movie would need like wonderful story and good character interactions october sky will remain in heart for as long as i can remember and i just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this film,1
i just came from seeing this movie and decided to see what others thought of it i'm left wondering if these people who give glowing reviews saw the same film this is potentially a very good story but it fails to hit the mark the script is very weak the plot has so many holes that it would make a great dip net for the fishing scenes the characters were not well developed and the storyline jumps around so much that i found myself asking the question how did we get here at least a half dozen times during the movie br br there was a lack of any chemistry between the cast members this is probably related to lindsay lohan's antics during the filming it was pretty clear that everyone showed up and did their job but didn't commit to their roles br br this is not a movie worth seeing go for a walk play a board game take a nice warm bath and save your money for something that's worth it,0
the mother is one of those films that you know is good maybe even great but it is like eating vegetables or doing math homework is to a kid too much work and a whole lot of pain to get invested in br br the story is potentially distasteful in many ways the death of a character within the first half hour the december may romance the idea of a man cheating on his wife and then cheating on his lover with her mother the collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty something characters the apparent indifference of the adults to the children in their lives this movie was made in the 2002 or 2003 but is a throw back to a collection of british usually made for tv movies from the late 1980's it has a moral severity that never lets up which produces an enveloping throbbing angst br br the mother is flawless but that is in part the problem if a film dealing with so many sensitive issues has some flaws inconsistencies of script some lesser actors it takes the edge off but if such a film is so pitch perfect the experience of watching it is raw and painful even the technical qualities lighting editing etc make the viewer ache the london in this movie is bright and open filled with harsh cutting light br br if you are tough as nails or are one of those super sensitive people who likes to torture themselves with gut wrenching sad movies or novels then you will enjoy the mother anyone in between give it a miss or be prepared to squirm and be warned as tough as the movie is from beginning to near end the worst is to come br br toward the end of the movie the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up for it for having slept with her boyfriend and the daughter calmly says that she has thought about it and would like to hit her the mother agrees to this they both stand up and instead of a well primed slap the daughter clenches her fist and delivers a boxer's blow argh,1
pierce brosnan will probably be the only thing familiar in richard attenborough's new biopic the rest is new to international audiences canadian history and first nations culture br br grey owl is a light examination of how an man came to be adopted into the ojibway of northern ontario learning and preaching environmentalism decades before it became politically correct to do so the film contains a love story a moral message and a man tortured by his past that torture though is not always brought to life with the dramatic impact that it might br br nevertheless it is a film which holds its audience without any violence it pays deep respect to canada's first nations and presents them in a dignified and non stereotypical manner brosnan's performance is somewhat stiff but i suspect that's just how lord attenborough wanted him br br thanks from a proud canadian,1
this movie let me down decidedly hard it was a great concept that was ruined with a horrible script the story just didn't flow and was disjointed at best there were so many elements to this story that were not explained or were forced into place with out any real thought elements like the love story could have been expanded on a bit more and the cannons need to be written in better the whole main character growing up thing needed more about the training he was receiving and less standing around everyone likes a good little guy overcomes story and this showed promise but with the scripting failures wasn't to be while it did have some pyrotechnics in the final battle sequence it was lackluster due to a lack of choreography this made for a maddeningly boring watch br br it could have been so good,0
this may very well be the worst movie i'll see if i live to be 100 i think a group of first graders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this i'm dumber for having watched it and god have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film br br and after i finally turned it off i actually had the urge to vomit br br no one had a clue about photography when made this no one had a clue about acting no one had a clue about just about anything br br i can't believe f x shows this crap on occasion the only time i had seen it was on one of the starz channels not even the main one and it was on at about 3 a m at that,0
well not yet at least br br it's not listed in the worst 100 br br so let's all team up and put it in it's rightful place br br this is truly a bad movie and i liked ishtar,0
this was a big disappointment for me i think this is the worst mastroianni movie ever made cosmatos tries too hard to make this movie a masterpiece and that makes this movie a typical art movie i give 4 10 for this movie,0
roommates sugar and bobby lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on all that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family br br this one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that i started feeling bad for poor hank worden who truly deserved much much better as much as i didn't like barracuda that's on the same dvd i have to admit that this film makes that one look like citizen kane br br eye candy one pair of tits they might belong to kirsten baker br br my grade f br br dark sky dvd extras vintage ads for various drive in food and trailers for bonnie's kids features nudity the centerfold girls part time wife features nudity psychic killer eaten alive the dvd also comes with 1978's barracuda,0
there are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives these once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don't meet these people anymore we don't always even know their names as we are never presented to each other and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are it's funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such because reuniting might spoil fond memories or we don't know do they we are too afraid to check that out br br the movie 'before sunrise' just caught me watching it i never had intention to watch it through but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting i gave a look for the rest of the film i didn't know what to expect from it but nor did the young couple they had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate i believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through it makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives,1
what is happening to itv drama first losing gemma quite simply the worst tv drama i have seen in years and now perfect parents a complete shambles from start to finish whoever is responsible for commissioning this drivel should be receiving there p45 by special delivery br br in most drama thrillers a requirement to suspend certain levels of belief is necessary so that the the plot line can develop but perfect parents took this to a new level i suspended so much belief by the end of this nonsense i felt i had been force fed on a lorry load of magic mushrooms it was like the scriptwriters had decided to try and create a drama by numbers involving some serious issues religion education greed fear murder paedophillia the only trouble was as the great eric morecambe once said when playing a piano i'm playing all the right notes just not necessarily in the correct order for your next script guys i suggest you try reading a few more books on script development than script writing for dummies br br due to the ridiculous script and the utter lack of tension in the direction the acting was suitably low key not the fault of the actors as the cast was top notch but i suggest that all of the actors involved in this sorry piece of drama should instruct their agents the next time the postman attempts to deliver a script from itv drama department make sure the letterbox is firmly nailed shut,0
i love this show it's like watching a mini movie each week the first episode was so gripping and terrifying so was part 2 of the pilot i'm definitely gonna keep tuning into this show this is the real survivor i've looked at a few of the other comments and i can see that already after just one or two episodes the morons here are already crying wolf sorry if it's not another reality show kiddies there was once a time where there were now brace yourself actual tv shows and this one is actually good unlike most of the crappy sitcoms today or the ump teenth carbon copy of a law order or nypd blue or csi series they're dishing out watch this yourself to form your own opinion don't take one from the boneheads here,1
there isn't a whole lot going on in this story just two men employing very different ways of handling memories of vietnam but what it lacks in premise it more than makes up for in acting and realism it's a quiet film about the bonds of friendship and shared experience we even get romance not gratuitous just another very real piece of this story it's well worth seeing,1
i saw this last week after picking up the dvd cheap i had wanted to see it for ages finding the plot outline very intriguing so my disappointment was great to say the least i thought the lead actor was very flat this kind of part required a performance like johny depp's in the ninth gate of which this is almost a complete rip off but i guess tv budgets don't always stretch to this kind of acting ability br br i also the thought the direction was confused and dull serving only to remind me that carpenter hasn't done a decent movie since in the mouth of madness as for the story well i was disappointed there as well there was no way it could meet my expectation i guess but i thought the payoff and explanation was poor and the way he finally got the film anti climactic to say the least br br this was written by one of the main contributors to aicn and you can tell he does love his cinema but i would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise br br i took the dvd back to the store the same day,0
haven't seen the film since first released but it was memorable performances by rip torn and conchata farrell were superb photography excellent moving story line and everything else about it was of the highest standard yet it seems to have been pretty much forgotten br br maybe because uk is an odd market for it but i haven't seen the film on tv or video which is sad has it had more success in us where it might rightly be seen as a quite accurate historical drama br br always reckon that 50 of a good film is the music and though i'm not certain i think the title theme was a simple but moving clarinet solo of what a friend we have in jesus the film then went on to disprove that am i right or wrong,1
i had the opportunity to see this film debut at the appalachian film festival in which it won an award for best picture this film is brilliantly done with an excellent cast that works well as an ensemble my favorite performances were from youssef kerkour justin lane and adam jones also there are some great effects with dragonflies and cockroaches that i was surprised to find out that this film was done on a small budget the writer director adam jones who i believe also won an award for his writing does an excellent job with direction the audience loved this movie cross eyed will keep you laughing throughout the movie definitely a must see,1
the first time i saw this film i loved it it was different br br i am a christian bible believing i don't go along with the crowd of right wing believers i dropped out of that atmosphere br br to me in their attempts to take over our government they are doing what judas tried to do i call it the judas syndrome br br judas didn't get it even though jesus said his kingdom was not of this world br br this film certainly showed some of that br br i also liked that jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples br br also he was a very gorgeous jesus br br it's a watch over and over movie br br very satisfying,1
now i really liked this movie it was so funny both akshay kumar and john abraham are brilliant actors i think after watching this film they should do lots more films together in the future br br akshay kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble by dating 3 women at the same time but the way he handles in when one comes out of the door and then the other one was just so funny to watch he acted really well int his film and i hope that he makes more great comedy's like this one in the future john abraham plays his best friend he plays his role really well and he is so underrated i am glad that some of his amazing work has got noticed but he is a really good actor i just love john neha dhupia has a small role in this film and plays it well br br the muse is really good i really recommend this movie to everyone,1
i saw this recently on a faded old vhs tape and remembered it dimly looking at it now it seems charming br br when it was first released it was recognized by pretty much everyone as a spoof of coming out as a gay teenager to hammer the point home the mother is seen reading a paperback copy of 1 teenager in 10 the most popular coming out book of the time david warner hams it up as the persecuting vampire hunter gay hating evangelist who is of course a self loathing closet case the list of sight gags and in jokes that were included to make sure nobody missed the point would be too long to go into the producers were having some good natured fun and hoping no doubt to lighten up as well as to enlighten br br but i have no clue how a teenage audience would look at this film nowadays in some places where there is education and culture the terrifying ordeals that gay teens had to go through are a thing of the past but i'm sure there are plenty of dark nasty corners of our continent where it's just as bad as it always was,0
this movie is ridiculous anyone saying the acting is great and the casting is superb have never seen even mediocre cinema the acting is obviously terrible in the first 5 characters you meet lame i feel like all the other soaring comments must have been made by people associated with the filmmakers i was not very impressed by the storyline but just wanted to see some beautiful oregon countryside and there was some decent cinematography but the casting was anything but inspired i think this movie also makes a mockery of the generally noble suggestion that something deep in the amerindian culture has been ignored and perhaps lost and that reviving it is worthwhile and possible it places jokes in the wrong and all too obvious places and makes me think it was written by the state department or something back to the drawing board to even suggest that this film deserves a place in the same vicinity of classics like harold and maude is absolutely retarded and along the same line of begging and pretension and joking as is rampant in this film,0
bela lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife looking young and beautiful to this end he drugs brides during their wedding ceremonies to make it look as if they are dead so he can steal their bodies i'm not exactly sure what he does with the bodies i don't remember it ever being fully explained all i know is that he extracts something from them and injects it in his wife i'll just guess that it's spinal fluid spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 40s you can pretty much guess the rest from here br br there are a couple well really more than a couple but i'll only write about two of problems that i have with this movie one is the way bela is used sure he does a decent enough job in his own overacting sort of way btw the rest of the cast is simply abysmal but to have him hiding in the back of a hearse or having him creep into the female reporter's bedroom to do nothing is just silly also why have him beat and or kill every henchman he has is it to make him look evil well someone who is kidnapping comatose brides doesn't really need to be made to look more evil br br the second problem i have is the idea of drugging brides why brides wouldn't any female under the age of 20 do watching bela go through these gyrations to get his victims i was reminded of the idiotic fisherman in i still know what you did last summer in each case there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective than employing a seemingly impossible plan that depends way to much on circumstances out of your control btw an alternate title for this movie is the case of the missing brides i guess that partially explains the need for 'brides',0
i'd just like to say that i've seen this film twice now and i love it the acting is great and even though it is a similar plot to raise your voice i think that the plot never gets boring for people who like that kind of thing it has some great lessons in it and shows us that we can do anything if we try an incredible film i am sure that this is one i will be watching for a long time to come even though britney spears write the book it is quite a realistic plot maybe not about the falling in love part but the part about being different and struggling but coming out best in the end is very true to real life the only minor criticism is why is the main girl in these films always beautiful do you really think that holly would have met the perfect guy of her dreams if she was ugly or average i doubt it,1
the season finale sent mix messages i felt feelings of joy and also feelings of being lied to and deceived roseanne tells all her viewers that the entire season nine was a lie because her husband dan had died she also admits the family never won the lottery and what season 9 was a lie just being how she wished or wanted it to be i'm still confused about when she said becky ended up with david and darlene with mark because becky and mark admit to being pregnant so i believe that is just how she wanted it to be but it wasn't so the season finale was good but sent mixed feelings i will always be a fan of the show,1
this was a watchable movie but plot was a little weak and most of the jokes were from some of rodney's earlier movies with that said it was worth the time to watch i gave this a 5 out of 10 so basically its one of those movies that you do not go out of your way to see but if you find it on the tube take a chance,0
i knew this movie wasn't going to be amazing but i thought i would give it a chance i am a fan of luke wilson so i thought it had potential unfortunately a lot of the movie's dialog was very fake sounding and cheesy i think that aquafresh gave some money towards the production of the film because they were seriously dropping some hints throughout there is a shot where the aquafresh sign sticks out at you that you can't help but notice it maybe they should have focused on writing and acting more than how many times can we drop aquafresh products in the movie without people getting annoyed the movie had its moments but i'm glad i didn't spend 9 50 to see it in the theater,0
a highly atmospheric cheapie showing great ingenuity in the use of props sets and effects fog lighting focus to create an eerie and moody texture the story is farfetched the acting is merely functional but it shows how imaginative effects can develop an entire visual narrative this movie is recommended for its mood and texture not for its story,1
cliché ridden story of an impending divorce or is it through the eyes of a 6 year old child corny dialogue cardboard characters stock situations a red herring zombie sub plot and worst of all absolutely no payoff either emotionally or dramatically br br does no one teach creative writing any more the true sign of a weak storyteller when you cannot create any kind of satisfying denouement just end the story i'm compelled to ask what made you think this was a story worth telling in the first place br br good but wasted debut by child actor anthony de marco the rest of the cast was at best forgettable and they wonder why no one watches indie films this is ninety minutes of my life i will never get back,0
i really don't understand all these positive user reviews this movie is the worst movie i've ever seen and i'm not trying to be pessimistic br br eva mendez is hot but terrible in this film but i don't think it is her own fault but the directors he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial their acting the idea the make up everything br br the star i'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie which was very bad executed br br don't watch this bullshit go watch a fellini woody allen or some david lynch,0
dr seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive cat in the hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop we have mike myers as the infamous cat in the hat big mistake myers proves he can't act in this film he acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve the kids in this movie are all right somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying the story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories never tweak with the original story bringing in the evil neighbor quin was a bad idea he is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life this movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it the film sure does look tacky sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word mildly funny at least the grinch had spunk and the film was actually good this film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting was mike myers even in this movie actually and another thing the fish what is with that stupid fish first time you see him he's an actual fish next time you see him he's all animated and talking but he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough this film is a total off target wreck good joke bad joke bad bad bad good joke i'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke that was good so please if you have the choice watch the grinch instead of this mess,0
the secret of kells is one of the most unique beautiful and eye popping animated films i have ever seen before watching this film i was convinced that nothing could give up a run for its money and that it was a shoo in to win in this category but i found in kells a serious contender br br the secret of kells tell the story of a young orphan named brendan who lives with his uncle the abbot of kell the abbot is a loving guardian but perhaps a bit too strict and much more concerned with fortifying the wall around the town from a coming attack by vikings than he is at nurturing the boy's imagination when the legendary brother aidan who looks surprisingly like willie nelson shows up and takes the boy under his wing brendan goes on a journey into the woods and meets a lovely forest nymph named aisling who takes a liking to him and saves his life more than once with aisling's help he attempts to save the town and help brother aidan complete the mystical book whichlegend has itcan turn dark into light br br see my full review of the secret of kells at http theoscarsblog blogspot com 2010 02 movie review secret of kells html,1

about 4 years ago i liked this movie i would watch it over and over and over but now i don't actually i think this movie would have been great for mystery science theater 3000 it has a bunch of comment heavy actors macaulay culkin christopher lloyd patrick stewart whoopi goldberg and a pretty cheesy plot my favorite part is when culkin is riding his bike and he comes across a gang and a gang member says hey tyler where ya goin' the moon also look out for the classic line do you have feeling in your toes br br on the other hand it's better than the good son,0
the film begins with vincent price about to begin his performance as a magician however mid way through the very successful show the police come and shut him down it seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks price had created even those he made on his own time at home as a result price justifiably kills the evil man the problem is that while the viewer understood why price killed and most probably thought this was a good thing because price was a bit mad he just couldn't stop at one sort of like eating lay's potato chips br br the film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows great plot twists as well as exciting action one thing you can't say about this film is that it is dull while it's also far from subtle it is fun throughout though and well worth a look br br had i never seen vincent price's version of house of wax i probably would have liked the mad magician a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9 that's because while the mad magician is a wonderful film it's highly reminiscent of the film that preceded it house of wax the bottom line is that since house of wax was so successful the formula was re hashed in the follow up film both were made in 3 d both have a plot where price has every justification to kill but he can't stop once he's committed the first and both are great fun to watch the biggest differences and there are few are that house of wax was in color and was more of a horror film and the mad magician was definitely more of a mystery br br my advice is to see this film and house of wax the price version only they are both terrific 1950s horror films,1
sadly marry harron decided to do a fictional account of bettie page's life to go along with her own issues with men as typical in all her work every major male character is portrayed as weak bumbling or twisted to add to her fiction she projects ideas and issues that are not true according to bettie page herself bettie did not leave the biz because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious issues though she became a born again later in life through the influence of her 3rd husband a minister she left it because she was in her late 30's her acting career had gone nowhere and she felt she was losing her looks the hints of molestation and rape are unvalidated and denied in bettie's own words and are the director's attempts to claim that any woman who did what bettie did must have been victimized by men harron fails to point out that bettie designed her own clothes in almost all her shoots not handed to her by sick fetishists harron also fails to make a point that bunny yeager who did many famous photo shoots of bettie also did many naughty shoots with bettie and was not the morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the film br br the only saving grace is gretchen mol looks very much like bettie otherwise there are other movies and documentaries more accurate and honest to her life and the people in it,0

this is probably one of the worst french movies i have seen so far among more than 100 french movies i have ever seen terrible screenplay and very medioacre unprofessional acting causes the directing powerless with all that it doesn't matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the story br br one of the key weakness of this movie is that these two characters do not attract people as an audience i don't care what happens to them br br it amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes man i love almost all the awarded movies in cannes but not this one a major disappointment for me,0
the original animated dark knight returns in this ace adventure movie that rivals mask of phantasm in its coolness there's a lot of style and intelligence in mystery of the batwoman so much more than batman forever or batman and robin br br there's a new crime fighter on the streets of gotham she dresses like a bat but she's not a grown up batgirl and batman is denying any affiliation with her meanwhile bruce wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work but the penguin bain and the local mob makes things little more complicated br br i didn't have high hopes for this 'un since being strongly let down but the weak batman sub zero robin isn't featured so much here but i was delighted with the imaginative and exciting set pieces the clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor this is definitely a movie no fan of batman should be without keep your ears open for a really catchy song called 'betcha neva' which is featured prominently through out br br it's a shame the dvd isn't so great don't get me wrong there are some great features the short 'chase me' is awesome and a very cool dolby 5 1 soundtrack but the movie is presented in pan and scan batman mystery of the batwoman was drawn and shot in 1 85 1 but this dvd is presented in 1 33 1 an in comparison to the widescreen clips shown on the features there is picture cut off on both sides i find this extremely annoying considering mask of phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen warner have had to re release literally dozens of movies on dvd because people have complained about the lack of original aspect ratio available on some titles why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond me br br i would give this dvd 5 5 but the lack of oar brings the overall score down to 4 5 it's a shame because widescreen would have completed a great dvd package,1
being an austrian myself this has been a straight knock in my face fortunately i don't live nowhere near the place where this movie takes place but unfortunately it portrays everything that the rest of austria hates about viennese people or people close to that region and it is very easy to read that this is exactly the directors intention to let your head sink into your hands and say oh my god how can that be possible no not with me the in my opinion totally exaggerated uncensored swinger club scene is not necessary i watch porn sure but in this context i was rather disgusted than put in the right context br br this movie tells a story about how misled people who suffer from lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons a girl who is treated like a whore by her super jealous boyfriend and still keeps coming back a female teacher who discovers her masochism by putting the life of her super cruel lover on the line an old couple who has an almost mathematical daily cycle she is the official replacement of his ex wife a couple that has just divorced and has the ex husband suffer under the acts of his former wife obviously having a relationship with her masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks her drivers the most unusual questions and stretches their nerves by just being super annoying br br after having seen it you feel almost nothing you're not even shocked sad depressed or feel like doing anything maybe that's why i gave it 7 points it made me react in a way i never reacted before if that's good or bad is up to you,1
the film portrays france's unresolved problems with its colonial legacy in western francophone africa through the befuddled and complex psychoanalytical prism of a young woman france herein symbolically representing her nation it is an often engaging and challenging portrait of a young woman's desire to come to terms with a traumatic moment in her past in particular and a nation's desire to reach out to the 'other' it once 'owned' and moulded this is reflected in the way in which it centres entirely around the notion of travelling or being in transit from the present to the past remembered realities to undeniable contemporary political and economic actualities br br the characters all play a symbolic albeit a limited and unconvincing role france meant to be a visual as well as a totemic representation of contemporary french society leaves one indifferent to her plight as she seems still to be imbued with the same naiveté she enjoyed as a child in fact as a child she seems more in possession of her reality the rest of the rag tag ensemble is just forgettable the black africans are to say the least offencive impressionistic portraits of former colonised peoples now colonised by the director's poor handling of her material they are no more than a dark and moribund backdrop against which the blythe like france wonders seeking a world she never knew and hoping for one that can never be found in cameroon,0
when it comes to the erotic genre i'm lucky to get through the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something else to watch this movie is different julie davis i love you don't touch me directed two very strong lead actors kira reed and doug jeffery in this enthralling thriller kira is convincing as kim a sweet innocent romance novelist that gets caught in the web of seduction of doug jeffery's the man a handsome stranger kira loses control of her inhibitions in the role and as actress giving what could have been simply another t and a depth and believability i believe it to be her best performance yet and julie davis' direction is a great gift to erotica,1
this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and still roll with it you have a insecure troubled and fascinating main character played by jean pierre léaud who is trapped between two no three women we listen to his social philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in interminable monologues we see him working his magic around the three women that he loves this could be the premise for a fowl movie full of rigid cold uninteresting commentaries yet director jean eustache manages to keep it fresh ironic and witty being such a long movie one cannot but burst into laughing when after 2 hours of speaking politely jean pierre léaud all of a sudden screams on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie this kind of situations are purely cinematographic and cannot be fully restored in a commentary nor can someone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of françoise lebrun towards the end of the movie 3 and 1 2 hours and worthing every minute,1
as a biographical film the lady with red hair the story of how director producer playwright david belasco transformed notorious society divorcee mrs leslie carter into an international stage star is certainly not in a league with that other warner's biopic of similar vintage yankee doodle dandy what is but lady is an enjoyable film in its own right and shares quite a few traits in common with the cagney classic br br like yankee doodle dandy the lady with red hair brims over with old time show business flavor among other things both films feature delicious theatrical boarding house sequences as well as the inevitable scenes set backstage and in theatrical managers' offices also in lady as in the cohan biopic the supporting cast is made up of familiar and beloved character actors of the period all doing the sort of top notch work we remember them for br br need i add that again like yankee doodle dandy the lady with red hair doesn't let the truth get in the way of telling a good story but also like dandy lady does manage gloriously to convey the esssence of its show business giant hero's larger than life personality everyone knows that cagney limned cohan for all time in his brilliant and affectionate portrayal in yankee doodle dandy but few moviegoers realize that claude rains did a similar service for david belasco in the lady with red hair and did it with a panache that almost equals cagney's br br rains as belasco perfectly captures that legendary showman's galvanic personality in all its outsized glory rains gives a tremendously enjoyable superbly observed and remarkably true to life performance as the man all broadway once called the wizard to watch claude rains in action looking in every shot as if he's having a helluva good time in the lady with red hair is to see david belasco leap to life on film as if he can't wait to shake things up on the main stem once again br br,1
love the tv show was hooked first time i saw it wish i was there acting in with them it touches reality when you love someone and you are thinking that you want to spend the rest of your life with then at a turn of events that you meet someone else and that person is more of who you want to be with you are in a situation were you have to choose one or the other someone is going to get hurt there's no stopping that making the decision is hard but do you want to go on being unhappy when you could have been why go on and live a life that you thought that you wanted or thinking you are doing the right thing and you both be unhappy that other person isn't going to wait a life time waiting they have a life a well making the decision that you really want will be better in the end making the best of what you have is a good thing a well money cars houses etc don't make you happy having the one person that you really want to be with to share it with does,1
after growing up in the gritty streets of detroit mi and having friends who traveled to new york balls i fell into the lifestyle of being a house member i joined the house of theieves we adapted the same rules as most houses but we were professional crooks that would boost and commit credit card fraud to obtain the fabulous jewels and clothes we desired i even learned how to profess the making of checks and driver's license and cash them in over seventeen states until a jealous queen called the secret service on me and i went to federal prison but i learned a lot from these queens in this movie and i highly recommend you watch it yourself you can even read about how i grew up in the houses here in detroit and the criminal activity we indulged in my book identity schemes is available on sale at amazon dot com or at identity schemes dot com but trust me it is a lot better than paris is burning because its a 2005 make,1
br br in 1970 after a five year absence kurosawa made what would be his first film in color dodes' ka den is a film that centers around many intertwining stories that go on in a small tokyo slum br br the title comes from the sound a mentally retarded boy makes as he imagines he is operating a train we slowly get to know more of the people in the small community the two drunks who trade wives because they are not happy with the ones they have the old man who is the center of the town who helps out a burglar that tries to rob him the very poor father and son that cannot ever afford a house so they imagine one up of their own by the end of the film the stories all come full circle some turn out happy others sad br br since this was kurosawa's first color film you can see that he uses it to his advantage and it shows maybe too much this movie goes in many different directions and it's hard to settle down and get into it but don't get me wrong dodes' ka den may not be kurosawa's best but coming from the greatest director of all time it's much better than 99 of today's films,1
this so called remake is terrible i went to see this tonight on the first day as the anticipation and hype was too much for me to handle but within the first half an hour we knew that this is a disaster it not only does not match the hype created but also insults the original blockbuster the script had loopholes the editing was untidy quite a few times mohanlal who is an excellent actor did an okay job amitabh was alright the director wanted to portray how evil his character is but he went a bit overboard which resulted in it being forceful ajay who is especially smooth in these kind of roles was also a disappointment lets not even get started about the new guy prashant one wouldn't be proud to start off a career with something like this rajpal yadav who was thrown in for a few laughs couldn't even get a smile out of anyone because of his forceful humor and the shrill voice nisha kothari proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have today all in all rgv who i thought was one of the most talented and gifted directors india has had failed miserably he took up such a huge challenge and responsibility to remake what is known as the best hindi movie ever and made a mess out of it,0
i can't see the point in burying a movie like this in sulfuric sarcasm when it is in no way intended to be anything more than a vehicle to entertain children and prepare them for the next line of merchandise to beg madly about br br this is a fun movie my children sat quietly through the entire thing and loved every minute of it granted the villain is a bit over the top with his silly costume and maniacal laugher but this is a lot more easier to take than the dark gloomy and very morbid pokemon 3 br br my children have been watching pokemon since it started and they are soon getting to the ages where they will put off the childish things and move on to others i am glad that we got to enjoy this together,1
the acting is some of the worst i've ever seen the characters are totally unconvincing this could be overlooked to some extent if the plot was interesting which the plot to the prodigy was not it's sort of a bad mix between fresh and animal house except that both of those movies were good,0
words are seriously not enough convey the emotional power of this film it's one of the most wrenching you'll ever see yet the ending is one of the most loving tender and emotionally fulfilling you could hope for every actor in every role is terrific especially a wise and understated jamie lee curtis a tightly wound and anguished ray liotta and a heart stopping turn from tom hulce that should have had him up for every award in the book he's the 1 pick for 1988's best actor in danny peary's alternate oscars the last half hour borders on melodrama but the film earns every one of its tears and unless you're made of stone there will be plenty of them,1
this movie is painfully slow and has no plot it conveys the lives of a group of laid off boatworkers one of the older ones is sincere in his attempt to get a job there may be some social commentary here but it is muddled as nobody is painted in a very sympathetic light br br i do not understand why it had a 7 8 when i decided to watch it i watched the whole tedious thing and built expectations for a huge redeeming payoff no luck the imdb rating has always been such a good match for my tastes anything above 6 5 was worth watching br br and my wife says javier barem does not even look good in this movie he's not my type so my agreement does not mean much br br sigh i give it a 1,0
what a long drawn out pointless movie i'm sure that historically this film is delightful but as entertainment goes it just doesn't make the grade ralph fiennes has been in some fantastic movies the english patient schindler's list but this one was such a let down it didn't seem to be going anywhere his character at the beginning was so shallow and uptight it amazes me that his sister would ever have been interested at all don't bother paying to rent this movie buy yourself a copy of the english patient instead,0
this is quite literally the worst movie i have ever watched in my life it may be the worst movie possible some movies are so bad that they're good this movie is so bad that it goes past enjoyable camp and simply becomes unwatchably awful it is the anti enantiodromia we bought it with the intent to heckle and all of my family gathered around for a fun evening of clever remarks instead we sat in stunned silence pitying poor peter sellers br br this is worse than the animated lord of the rings it is worse than the matrix sequels it is worse than krull it is worse than any batman movie br br do not under any circumstances let this movie approach within ten feet of your television,0
one of the best love stories i have ever seen it is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion but lovely nonetheless big edie and little edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly and are infinitely quotable it's a goddamned beautiful day now will you just shut up the opening explanation of little edie's costume only promises that the movie will live on forever and so will big edie the world famous singer and little edie the world famous dancer,1
after seeing the 1996 remake i thought it was the funniest way to see cruella de vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin the whole movie was quite funny and on my view better than the animated one but there was actually no need for a second one first of all if cruela is returning don't cure her and make her insane again just make her break away from jail and that's a rap i thought it was not very funny it's supposed to have only one original puppy returning i'd expected that it should be lucky since he was the most appealing and besides having roger and anita back too however they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred not even one hundred and two but only three puppies and a parrot that thinks he's a dog clever gerard depardieu's part was pointless at the end cruella suffers way too much way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true she gets baked inside a giant cake that was a desperate attempt of physical humor trying to imitate the same effect from the first one that just didn't work it was too much over the top and not too funny i actually felt sorry about cruella,0
ok aside from the psychedelic background imagery the info presented here was good the music i could have done without not that it was bad music just that it didn't fit this film at all br br as for the content of the film the director brings up the often lacking pagan perspective on christ's existence and a startling comparison of the deeds and events of christ's life vs the lives of mythological figures deities such as mithra and dionyses then he brings up the chronology of christianity's origins and presents an 'ok' case but not one that blew me away br br if the director had stuck with the facts and continued on with them this film would have been good however at this point in the film it disintegrates into a group of personally gratifying attacks on mel gibson's passion of the christ and a christian private school which the director attended in his youth during an interview with his old principal which during the course of it comes to light that the director set up under false pretenses i felt that the director was acting sort of childish he was asking good questions but like the film itself the interview crumbled into an attack on this particular private school's rules not christianity br br all in all if you're just interested in some info watch the first 30 minutes or so and then shut it off,0
lion king 1 1 2 is the funniest non theatrical release from disney i recently saw this movie again after not seeing it in many years i remember first time i saw it i didn't had any expectations at all and were pleasantly surprised by this watchable and highly entertaining movie br br is it better than simba's pride in many ways yes though simba's pride wasn't exactly bad it did suffer some problems lack of an good script and bad characterizations which made impact of what otherwise a okay film br br anyway it's nice to see timon and pumbaa's personalities blossom again in the way that we or certainly me loved about them in this film in simba's pride they were completely annoying and i didn't liked the timon and pumbaa series neither br br this film could easily have been a stupid one but fortunately the filmmakers didn't took the wrong turn and instead focused to make this film at times extremely hilarious there are a few jokes that adults can enjoy on their own the score is quite good there are two new songs which are catchy and two new characters timon's mom voiced by recognizable marge simpsons' julie kavner and uncle max which are enjoyable the friendship between timon and pumbaa are touchingly portrayed the emotional scenes are well integrated in the comical story and doesn't feel out of place which it could have easily done especially in comedies br br but is there something that distracts this picture from getting 10 votes from me yes there is although they fortunately doesn't impact too much but i'll mention them 1 many of the scenes from the first film are used in this one personally it was weird to see the old scenes integrated with the new ones br br 2 during the climax some of the jokes becomes lame br br 3 storywise this is timon's story and although the filmmakers try to integrate his tale with simba's it makes the screenplay feel a little rushed at times br br but hey those details doesn't impact this otherwise amusing movie it is the only really acceptable disney sequel which should be in every movie collection,1
my family has watched arthur bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out we have most lines memorized i watched it two weeks ago and still get tickled at the simple humor and view at life that dudley moore portrays liza minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick though i'm not her biggest fan this movie makes me just enjoy watching movies my favorite scene is when arthur is visiting his fiancée's house his conversation with the butler and susan's father is side spitting the line from the butler would you care to wait in the library followed by arthur's reply yes i would the bathroom is out of the question is my newmail notification on my computer arthur is truly funny stuff,1
goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most legendary games in vg history their is no doubt about that but this game although quite different could quite possibly be the modern day bond champ of its time br br this was not a bond game based on material from another medium this was a completely new scripted game which even had its own theme song wouldnt be bond without it haha gameplay was excellent and if you're a fan of the bond games or films alike you'll enjoy it br br unlike some most games these cast members portrayed their characters themselves as opposed to fictional creations for the game which gives it that more cinematic feel with a very 'bond' able storyline you feel like you're in the game as much as you get lost in a movie br br enjoyable in all aspects from start to finish even after beating the game there's still plenty more to be done with the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved as well as its multi player missions this is a stand out game despite being quite old now in video game years it's still a good game that you can pick up play whenever you feel the need to get a little more bond in your life even now just thinking about it i've got the theme song stuck in my head such a great cast and well written storyline br br the story comes to life on the screen almost as if the actors were their in front of you and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself superbly done in true bond fashion which can only be named awesome completely awesome br br i've gotta go throw this game on now if you haven't played it yet you're missing out,1
i have no idea what the producers of the shield were trying to do but the result speaks for itself the shield is practically unwatchable br br supposedly the performances on the shield are great br br in reality the show is so badly put together that you can't even really see the performances for instance the editing cuts away from reaction shots before they've had their full impact br br i don't know what intellectual rationale there is for that but it robs the show of all emotional impact br br i'll give the shield one point for ambition in its subject matter but that's pretty much all i can give it br br it's a shame to see a number of talented performer waste their gift on something so strangely badly filmed,0
i first saw this film in 1980 in the midday movie spot after many subsequent viewings and purchase of the video it still makes me laugh out loud br br yes it's a relic of another age a domestic comedy set in affluent middle class america but well executed is well executed but it's also a document of its age a celebration of post war optimism the baby boom and the nascent consumer age this film is no guilty pleasure br br three wonderful sophisticated leads actors urbane melvyn douglas bemused cary grant daffily determined myrna loy complement each other and a memorable team of characters br br my favourite scenes it means we gotta blast and miss stellwaggen and this little piggy br br love it,1
transylvania 6 5000 is an insignificant but occasionally funny and charming mid 80's horror parody with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to chuckle in the script two bozo journalist of a gossipy tabloid newspaper are sent very much against their will to transylvania to do a story on the alleged return of mad scientist frankenstein there are some adorable little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the film like a little guillotine for hard boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are being used to put in cream and sugar at the breakfast table the wholesome of the film however is not as successful as it could and should have been with jokes and parody situations that are way too overlong the roger corman production transylvania twist which came out four years after this is a lot funnier and much more recommended the film is particularly parodying the classic universal milestones of the early 30's so you better make sure you've seen those if you want to grasp all the tiny gags and references there's a pretty original twist indicating that the frankenstein character only behaves like a mad raving evil scientist when he enters his laboratory it's also revealed that he's actually more of a father damien sort of messiah who's only concerned with the condition of exiled monsters michael richards the freaky guy who plays kramer in seinfeld stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments i'm pretty sure john turturro's character in mr deeds was inspired by richards's role here,0
i really enjoyed this movie i was fifteen when this movie came out and i could relate this will be a movie i would show my kids to let them know the feelings they are having are normal it is funny to see how we could be so devestated by things at such a young age who knew that we would bounce back again and again great movie,1
i saw this documentary at the cannes film festival in a small 200 seat cinema at the top of the main building at the cannes film festival br br i absolutely was into it i love the mix of awesomely made fictional scenes it is amazing set design the scenes look really like they were filmed in 1920ies or 1930ies br br and the music is so nice br br i rate this experience 9 10 br br spoilers ahead br br the documentary tells about awesome blues men with black and white old looking scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing it is really amazing but this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing i might dislike in this documentary it is the too abundant use of links to modern rock bands playing those blues songs in a modern way i didn't really appreciate their trashed way of playing such awesome blues songs this is the same kind of un perfect musical taste i found when watching wim wenders buena vista social club br br the documentary was such a standing ovation at this first screening in the little cinema that the next day this documentary was shown for everyone and normal tourists on the beach of the croisette at the open air cinema though the sand the quality of the projection and the bad quality of the sound probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy for the thousands of people who were sitting in the sand that night,1
warning contains a spoiler corny plot and in many cases terrible acting fontaine is great but some others particularly richard ney ivy's husband are exceedingly wooden ney lies in bed dying of arsenical poisoning with every hair in place yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful more faithful to the book than most movies of its era casting joan fontaine as a poisoner and an adulteress which was just as shocking then i'm not kidding kids was a masterful stroke she's just her usual joan fontainey self as murderers were supposed to she dies by falling feet foremost through the floor into an empty space,1
a couple janet and richard go camping out in the woods near a giant swamp after camping and enjoying nature the couple takes shelter in what they think is an abandoned farm house soon a pair of escaped convicts show up and after much delaying of the inevitable they proceed to rape janet and lock richard in a birdcage br br this last house on the left like film has to be one of the most underrated horror films ever made it's one of the more sick and twisted early 70s shockers moreover i found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in it's perverse tone i love caged terror the music definitely helps lend a sense of personality to the film as well as a lot of beauty i found the film to be quite creepy br br the flaws mainly have to do with the pacing of the film which is to say that the film is rather slow and meandering while i didn't mind the pacing due to the beauty and suspense of the film in question i do think that it will both most people the acting isn't too good nor is the dialogue at least in the early scenes this film takes a little more patience than usual and it's really not for everyone br br in short this was a good film not the greatest horror film i've ever seen but it is certainly a lot of fun it's not exactly the easiest film to find it's possible to find it in the used section of a lot of stores if you look hard enough it's not for everyone but if you're a fan of trash cinema then it's definitely worth checking out,1
was this the greatest movie that i have ever seen no was it the worst no br br as a mother of four kids it is nice to watch something that was light and amusing it was great but it was cute br br i think that it definitely had some room to improve but it tried br br i am not sure if this movie deserves the extreme level of abuse from the other reviewer they obviously do not care for eva longoria i think that she was better in this than in the sentinel i think that movies are a matter of opinion the actors play a huge role in whether it is a hit or a flop br br maybe the cast did not work out maybe there were too many things going on br br i just wanted to speak up for an average movie not a terrible one it could just be a chick flick kind of like the movie the split up or french kiss my husband still talks about those,0
a lot of people seemed to have liked the film so i feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review but after sitting through 96 minutes of it i feel i have to do so where the heck is the plot in this film i must have missed it i was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened sure the ending was somewhat shocking but they didn't build up to it i forgot who was who half of the time so they didn't really develop the characters the acting was so so most of the time it was believable but i was able to see through it most of the time so without giving anything away i must say that unless you like the actors in the film there is no real reason to watch this movie i could be mistaken but i just didn't understand why there was so little or too much of the film i can't decide which one that would be so i say judge for yourselves i don't even know if renting it would be a good idea the cost and all br br plot 0 10 characters 1 10 acting 2 10 overall 3 10 i feel like that's too high really i am staying with my vote up at the top,0
the photography was beautiful but i had difficulty understanding what was happening was there a lot of symbolism the 2 goldfishes do they mean something in thai culture there's not much plot not much happens and it just meanders along no real start no real middle and no real end rather unsatisfying really br br it was difficult to get into the characters as you never felt you got to know them it was difficult to know which scenes were imaginary and which were real the move felt chaotic and disjointed i don't know what the pang brothers were hoping to achieve maybe if i were thai it would make more sense,1
if i could give it less that 1 i would do not bother to rent if someone gives you the dvd burn it br br this is horrible movie making a total waste of even digital film i have seen better on youtube made by 12 year old boys lommel claims to have written this if that is the case he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages the story line is none existent the dialog is mainly screaming the camera work is some sort of attempted arty flairs with nonsensical cutting of totally unrelated jumps to either industrial transportation scenes or some sort of odd angry young woman rift br br i can usually follow a less than obvious plot or see the purpose in a creative film i like david lynch br br this one is either so far beyond my limited powers of comprehension i missed it or it is totally pointless i think this is a lets see if we can grab a title that will be coming out soon and do a weird rift on it and see if we can grab some of the bucks con job br br i cannot see why lionsgate even bothered with this totally worthless it is so bad i will not rent any other by this same director,0
as an amateur historian of ww2 nazi germany i couldn't wait for this to come out on dvd i missed it when it was first on in 2003 i don't want to repeat what's already been said in the previous 8 pages of comments about the historical inaccuracies a better job could've been done portraying the charming hitler i also had a small problem with some of the casting choices not so much for their acting but for their appearances peter stormare doesn't look much like rohm why didn't they make babson as hess wear a wig and my biggest complaint so much has always been made of hitler's striking blue eyes why didn't they make carlyle wear blue contacts on the plus side i thought the actors who played goring and drexler looked pretty good again as long as people watching this understand that this is supposed to be entertainment 1st history 2nd i don't think a lot of harm will be done,1
without mental anachronism this film which i would like to find in dvd offer an extraordinary diving in the vital and mental context of thought of the people before the disenchantment of the world that there is thirty years a director and a scenario writer could test one such empathy and such a romantic truth to do it of them masterpiece leaves me astounding it would be necessary to be able to see and re examine it film for better seizing than the temporal and cultural distance us to make lose of capacity to be included understood analyze and finally to accept of such or such example of primitive thought because this thought maintaining almost impossible to feel in the secularized world however contain certain keys of our behavior that only them future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance if somebody knows where i then to get a numerical copy or vhs to me or dvd thank you in advance,1
what were they thinking at cannes one of the most irritating films of all time every detail of this film no matter how meaningless was shown if i had to watch her put on those boots one more time i think i would have shouted if the point of this film was to show how pathetic a life rosetta had then it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credits should have been running but no we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over the whole thing was filled with un likeable and unsympathetic characters they deserved the misery that was rosetta and to think i passed up tumbleweeds to see this over hyped film of boredom it was like watching grass grow only that is more exciting,0
being the only movie i was able to see at this year's nordische filmtage at lübeck this year's festival will be remembered as a all time low for me br br this movie which was announced as an erotic thriller is nothing more than a sick piece of crap excuse the language but there aren't any decent words to describe it br br first of all the actors are not the best but even better actors would not have rescued the movie e g the plot after the first 15 minutes it was quite clear that john was sick the neighbour girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend the so called sex scene was nothing else but disgusting hitting each other until blood flows for me hasn't anything to do with sexuality but unfortunately that were not the only disgusting images to be shown everything else was copied by other directors like e g lynch but of course without their geniality br br so to summarize the whole film and to save other viewers time and money guy loses girlfriend girlfriend turns back home guy kills girlfriend and becomes mad afterwards guy imagines hot but crazy neighbour girls guy has very disgusting sex with one of them or so he thinks in the end he realizes he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lay in his apartment all the time bad story bad actors pictures that make you want to vomit br br 1 out of 10 1 point for the fact that you realize how good you can understand norwegian if you learned swedish at least one benefit of the evening and you can't choose 0 points here,0
this tragicomedy written by famous serbian theatre film writer dusan kovacevic is probably one of the best movies ever made in the comedy category and yet its appearance of a theatre play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value a masterpiece one should not miss to see preferably with subtitles and not dubbed br br in an aged bus en route to capital belgrade a looming war decides the passengers' behaviour two gypsy musicians sing of their miserable life but also foresee a tragedy to come their singing both divides and connects stages in this extraordinary road movie real life kostic brothers are amateur actors but together with stanojlo milinkovic as farmer who's plowed the road give a real life performance br br the spectrum of characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing a war an insight into nation's collective person everyone is aware that war is just about to begin but they try to live their own lives the best they can hoping that ignorance might avert the tragedy using a simple movie language director slobodan sijan paints a picture of society torn by previous war world war i but also highlights personal portraits with success provincialism of a singer inexperience of the newlyweds seriousness of the great war veteran who is on way to visit his recently conscripted son and gloomy predictions from a man who seems to be a german spy br br brilliant in its narration with memorable soundtrack especialy the gispsy songs and adjusted atmosphere well photographed and edited this feature sijan's feature debut was only an introduction into a series of the directors bitter sweet comedies that will define serbian cinematography of the 1980s maratonci trce pocasni krug kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota and my other director's favourite davitelj protiv davitelja,1
william shakespeare would be very proud of this particular version of his play not only is it the best movie version of it but it's also the only complete version of hamlet kenneth branagh's hamlet is simply genius not only because it was written by shakespeare but also because it had the guts to do the whole thing even if it went just over four hours br br we all know the story of the prince of denmark and his plot to avenge his father's death so i won't go into the details of the story i will however tell you that the best part of this hamlet version is not the breathtaking sets or the stunning photography but the actors' interpretations of each character i doubt you'll find a better polonius than richard briers' delicious portrayal plus you can't go wrong with julie christie and jack lemmon also derek jacobi a regular among shakespeare adaptations is magnificent as the antagonist to hamlet br br of course we must talk about kenneth branagh he wowed audiences when he came onto the scene with his first outing with shakespeare henry v he outdoes himself with hamlet sure olivier's presence was captivating but i think branagh's performance is wonderful when you watch him on screen it's almost as if he knew exactly how shakespeare wanted the role to be played how he wasn't nominated for an oscar is a total mystery at least the movie got a few nominations and even an odd choice for screenplay i guess they know good writing when they see it though br br all in all you'll never find a more rich and lavish production of the bard's best play to say that the technical aspects were awesome would be an understatement if you love this play and are a fan of shakespeare you definitely need to check this movie out even if you don't really care for shakespeare the visuals will keep you occupied for the duration of the film you may not think you'll be able to sit through all of it at once but you'll soon find out that pausing this movie will make you want to see it even more,1
always fancied this film from the video cover eventually got round to buying it for a fiver in a sale and boy what a film a simply stunning performance from all of the case and it's filmed so beautifully even at times from a distance so you can barely hear what the dialogue is as if you really are that distance away picking up bits of the tale it's really moving frequently amusing and very watchable not much dialogue but is filmed in such a way that you feel so much throuout a 9 10 from me a must see,1
so you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh well think again paulie is a wonderful film filled with touching moments the characters are all lovable especially paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his journey it is journey worth experiencing don't miss it it is available on home video,1
bad plot bad dialogue bad acting idiotic directing the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the overacted script and a crappy copy of the vhs cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor trust me because i stuck this turkey out to the end it was so pathetically bad all over that i had to figure it was a fourth rate spoof of springtime for hitler br br the girl who played janis joplin was the only faint spark of interest and that was only because she could sing better than the original br br if you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better then watch beyond the valley of the dolls,0
actually this is a lie shrek 3 d was actually the first 3d animated movie i bought it on dvd about 3 years ago didn't bug's life also do that i think it was at disneyworld in that tree so i'm saying before they go and use that as there logo also shrek 3d was a motion simulator at universal studios they should still consider it as a movie because it appeared in a theater and you could buy it for dvd the movie was cute at least the little flyes were i liked iq i agree with animaster they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out and back adventure i recommend it to families and kids,0
this is going to be the most useless comment i have ever put down but yet i must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that freddy's dead is it is not only the very worst chapter of the nightmare series but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time it was boring pointless and nearly death free the horrible 3 d ending and over the top corny kills are enough to drive this film into the ground however it doesn't stop there just add bad acting a terrible script and a number of cheesy cameos and you've got yourself this heaping pile of guano it's no wonder why freddy as always played by robert englund has made two postmortem appearances i would too if i went out like that this is a strictly fans only movie don't stare at our shame,0
another vast conspiracy movie that tries to blame the us government and the armed forces especially the army for every disaster since the great flood anyone who has ever served time in the us military can see how bogus this film is uniforms equipment sets and mannerisms are all wrong and of course all senior officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots blatant propaganda with no attempt at objectivity most of the theories presented have been disproven over the past few years uses every cliche' rumor and urban legend from the gulf all are presented as gospel the truth is no one knows for sure why some gw vets are sick and others are healthy as horses ps this is not new war is not fun and i know wwii korean and viet nam vets with some pretty serious ailments too and the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them sensationalistic movies like this will not solve the problem,0
this fabulous movie must be viewed knowing that millions scraped together 10 cents to see it and forget the gloomy day to day economic conditions during the 30's remember 10 cents bought a loaf of bread back then so this was a minor luxury for many people it's testimony to how hollywood did its best to make the usa feel a little better about itself you'll note that with the studio system in hollywood at the time many of the actors and actresses were type cast in similar movies e g james cagney william powell ruby keeler frank mchugh joan blondell and guy kibbee then too branches of the u s military were always respected with enthusiasm and patriotism as in the use of military precision marching by the great choreographer busby berkeley at the end,1
wow what can i say i like shity movies and i go out of my way to watch a corny action flick but snake eater i would have rather had a nail driven into my pee hole while my grandma gave me a lap dance lorenzo lamas pfft more like lorenzo lameass this guy has as much acting ability as bill clinton has self control it has all the goods to make a really bad movie even worse crazed hillbilles yep needless tit shot with a real weird scar yep crappy soundtrack yep i wish i could give the movie 10 stars but 1 is as low as it goes seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real the worse thing there is 2more snake eater movies guess its in demand,0
comedy central has a habit of putting on great programs at times chappelle's show the daily show colbert report and then there are those that some people love or hate stella dr katz then there are some shows that have their defenders but are just plain awful mencia and now sarah silverman br br this show is based on the fact silverman is self centered which can be funny colbert report but can be horrible mind of mencia it should shock no one that i believe the latter is the case this show is a parody of a sitcom and society a program so absurd it loses itself in its absurdity and it simply isn't funny a woman farting has been done in comedy many many times because its not something that's common we don't need 25 minutes of it when a criminal is disarmed by a queef it simply loses its appeal we saw it in jay and silent bob strike back except the women were hotter and the whole scene was more absurd making it better but the best comparison of this show is to stella except stella was more subtle which is what made the absurdist comedy funny it had better acting and i suppose a bit more of a fantastical realist view br br perhaps the fact some reviews are so negative i'm very skeptical of the critical acclaim but do not dispute fan reaction to this show is the amount of advertising on it very obnoxious ads through many programs far outdo advertising on for other programs many people are wondering why sarah silverman has a career and others are still bitter when better shows have been canceled this show should've never made it past the unaired pilot stage back to norm showed far more promise yet this show makes it further and as far as critics being correct many things have been universally panned have seen their status rise immensely last i checked britney spears gets good reviews too also take that comparison however you want because someone will no doubt accuse me of being psychotic on imdb for not liking this show,0
sadly it's true legiunea sträinä exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of daneliuc's irreversible failure br br as it was already said the author lost the faculty to coalesce his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form maniacally concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any legitimacy he only gathers a disordered pile of events unable to follow the least story line the script's level is similar to a cântarea româniei amateur play about the glorious feats of socialist realism only turned upside down while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugary festivism now daneliuc is as perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting scatology the ideas content is zero and the message infantile and didactic at a kindergarten level br br unfortunately he also forgot the most elementary professional tenets he isn't able anymore to organize a dramatic situation to order it in a correct movie scene to frame it right and to edit it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar his level of story telling in film images is similar to phrasing something like holy sheet man it ain't nuthin right 'ere and all da people is asses what a huge distance from the impressive artist of 1976 1984 who had created unique works as cursa proba de microfon vânätoarea de vulpi and even croaziera and glissando sic transit gloria mundi,0
i am a jane eyre lover and a purist and this version includes almost all of the important details of the book and the characters are portrayed as i imagined them jane eyre is a complex story of great richness and can't be delivered properly in a feature length format so it needs a tv mini series timothy dalton's rochester is probably the best ever there has been a lot of discussion about how attractive he is and his age in the book jane the narrator describes him as about 35 and not young but not yet middle aged i think timothy dalton was about 38 when he made this so that is about right also we only have jane's opinion of whether rochester is handsome she only just met him and he asks her bluntly what she thinks as an inexperienced and humble girl i can't imagine her saying she did think him handsome the actor playing rochester needs to show us the character of the man and this is fulfilled to perfection i love the relationship between the two leads which is the crucial thing about this story and the humour of their encounters other versions have blown it but this gets it right the 2006 version with toby stephens aged 37 years is in progress on bbc1 and is very good indeed so i will decide whether that is my favourite when it is completed br br on viewing this series again after watching the 2006 version i have decided that this version with timothy dalton and zelah clark is the best charlotte bronte's dialogue is preserved and this is essential to the power of the story modernisation just doesn't work it's a victorian story and having archaic poetic speech suits the characters this version has an excellent cast zelah clark is tiny and the difference in height between her and rochester is important timothy dalton has real presence and is an amazing actor there are no extra scenes to divert from the plot and the screenplay includes all the essential scenes but leaves out unnecessary details making it to the point and gripping i recommend it to all true jane eyre fans,1
this movie could have been 15 minutes long if it weren't for all the bickering between son and father very predictable both male stars need a good slap in the face would you like some cheese with that whine two chuckles and a headache i can understand why the mother left her hubby after 47 years i don't know how she lasted that long the first 5 minutes made me want to turn the movie off wishing i had never paid the 3 99 to watch it the movie didn't flow well and was painfully long i kept watching my watch hoping time would fly faster it didn't the script had so much repetition that it had to be easy for the writer to fill space on a positive note the scenery was pretty fall being my favorite season the car the 40 ford was also quite nice this movie gets an d rating approaching an f,0
as far as heist movies go this one is pretty weak continuity is pretty lousy there isn't enough character continuity to really feel like you understand any of the characters peter falk is great and he is one of the reasons its worth watching falk has some great lines like he'll be right back he goin' buy to some saugages or something like that there are a few nice scenes although they are entirely due to the efforts of the actors direction script and editing is pretty lousy,0
writer director john hughes covered all bases as usual with this bitter sweet sunday afternoon family movie curly sue is a sweet precocious orphan cared for from infancy by bill the pair live off their wits as they travel the great us of a fate matches them with a very pretty yuppie lawyer and the rest is predictable br br kids will love this film as they can relate to the heroine played by 9 year old alisan poter who went on to be the you go girl of pepsi commercials the character is supposed to be about 6 or 7 as she is urged to think about going to school some of her vocabulary suggests that she is every day of 9 or older br br similar to home alone there is plenty of slap stick and little fists punching big fat chins again this is formula film making aimed at a young audience entertaining and heartwarming don't look for any surprises but be prepared to shed a tear or two,1
truly terrible pretentious endless film director bellocchio seems to be infatuated with the pretty face and figure of his actress detmers and who can blame him but maybe just maybe he should have focused his attention a little more on making a good engaging film i hate it when a sex film poses as an art film just to become more respectable the frequent occasionally hot sex scenes are the only reason for this movie's existence whether or not they are worth sitting through the rest of the picture is strictly a matter of taste,0
this movie's full title is waqt race against time that's a race no one can ever win but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious waqt on this bakvaas this movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made k3g look honest it strained my credulity too far it was ridiculously stupid in its storyline and deserves to be mocked for it br br it's not quite as awful as baghban or black but this movie has nothing to recommend it stupid pointless with a ridiculously ott performance by amitji the central plot is another nasty example of the crudely manipulative propaganda that infests so many family bw films if my father who raised me and who i love dearly treated me like big b did akshay i'd shoot him myself to say nothing of the trivialising of terminal illness,0
dull predictable and uninteresting story of a man contaminated by a chemical substance weller who goes on across the country just to find his ex wife and children meanwhile he kills everyone in his way only by a single touch of his hands in his dangerous track a doctor hurt and a young reporter natasha try to stop the man the movie has a not original premise but even though could be much better the final result is just a movie without suspense or gritting moments even the good cast is completely waste i give this a 4 four,0
this was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it the fast moving story an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths etc funny thing is you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but white as anything else would be deemed racist by the pc police br br nonetheless woody harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players is interesting as is his main counterpart wesley snipes br br snipes had a lot of funny put down lines providing much of the humor the bad part of the film which doesn't bother a lot of people is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters that includes woody's girlfriend played by rosie perez there are no really clean nice people in this movie for that reason i can't honestly recommend the film at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity,0
in the fan robert de niro plays gil renard or is it travis bickle or rupert pupkin or max cady you see the problem with this type of role is that de niro has played very very similar characters in taxi driver the king of comedy and cape fear and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts i found it slightly difficult to believe that renard would have started out as a frustrated obsessive sports fan into being an out and out psycho br br the character arc isn't the only problem with this script it also lacks a character focus a problem i had with the untouchables where de niro should have been superb but ended up slightly flat for several stretches of the movie i kept thinking that bobby rayburn was the main character then the story switches back to renard it also seems to have disappointed a lot of sports fans who seem to think this should have concentrated a bit more on baseball i'm not sure if this was meant to appeal to baseball fans originally but again there are elements which hint it might have if the producers had made up their minds has to who and what the story should focus upon br br i will admit i was entertained by the fan especially by the soundtrack but it is a very flawed film and it should be remembered that by the mid 1990s characters being stalked by nutters as in single white female unlawful entry etc had run out of steam a long time ago,0
this is a film that the mainstream market will probably never be able to access as it doesn't exactly give the viewer easy watching the story about troubled spike and his friend heaton is not exactly a friday night film yet it has its own unique edge and i found that it was entertaining there are moments of brilliance given that the film was shot on such a low budget such as when spike inhales the aerosol however i did not really understand the relationship between spike and heaton and to be honest it made me spend most of the film trying to work it out and also i did not like the fact that most of the film is spent with the two friends talking and not really much action it is a small film that is complex to watch and that is what makes it appealing,1
i only today picked this up at the 99 cents only store today and i still think i got ripped off dream to believe is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and 1 is just too freakin' expensive for this this film is probably only notable for 2 things 1 it has a young keanu reeves and 2 it's directed by paul lynch the man who also did promo night now onto the movie br br it's about a girl named robin played by olivia d'abo who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her father's life so the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named tommy played by keanu robin when not in training works part time along with her mother and stepsister at a laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather eventually she is chosen to compete br br overall keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star and it's also not one of the worst movies ever but still far from good the dvd itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old vhs and towards the end the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over it fades to black even though sound can still be heard so this can probably be passed as a bootleg the dvd artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of keanu and olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie as it's also not in the movie itself so the cover's obviously photoshopped in any case avoid at all costs unless you're a keanu fanatic i probably won't be hanging to it any longer i'm probably gonna give it to the cinema snob who's a great yt critic btw hey if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight feel free to donate to him to keep his show running,0
a fine effort for an australian show which is probably not surprising seeing as there seems to be somewhat of a resurgence in quality aussie drama dare i compare this show to the brilliance of love my way no but it is reminiscent of early secret life of us the cast is great gibney works her magic in the first two episodes i have seen the british cast is strong also especially the callum and lizzie characters but abe forsythe may be the saving light not that it needs saving if this show is to get another season i wasn't a fan of his performance in the awesomely awesome marking time mini series a few years back but he was great as hal in always greener its also good to see brooke satchwell again lets hope the show keeps improving with each episode,1
not exactly a new story line but this romantic comedy makes the concept work a young man john cusack and a drop dead gorgeous woman kate beckinsale keep meeting by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other although both are promised to others oddly enough they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere a little sappy in some places but viva la love being a romantic i am almost obligated to be riveted my favorite scene is where cusack is on the ground and snow starts falling the finale is almost too sweet but most deserving this is not one of cusack's deeper roles but who in the hell could not be smitten by beckinsale notable support is provided by jeremy piven and molly shannon john corbett plays the worst role i've ever seen him in on the other hand eugene levy is quirky and funny watch this with your soul mate,0
so there's an old security guard and a guy who dies and then there's kevin the world's biggest wuss kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive bratty and virginal girlfriend amy as he returns from work to a random house he finds his friends the sexually confusing red shorted kyle and the truly revolting sluttish daphne they are soon joined by daphne's boyfriend the trigger happy sex crazed macho lunkhead nick and there's the title creatures horrid little dogeared puppets who kill people by giving them their heart's desire kyle's heart's desire is to mate with a creepy yucky woman in spandex nick's heart's desire is to throw grenades in a grade school cafeteria i mean nightclub kevin's heart's desire is to beat up a skinny thug with nunchucks amy's heart's desire is to be a disgusting slut daphne's already a disgusting slut so she doesn't have a heart's desire along the way a truly hideous band sings a truly odd song the hobgoblins randomly go back to where they came from then blow up citizen kane cannot hold a candle to this true masterpiece of american cinema,0
not since spongebob squarepants have i seen a greater cartoon on tv the colors are great the voices could't be better the characters are so original great great cartoon hope nickolodean continues to develop this cartoon hope the season dvd comes out soon i love cartoons like this and i hope more people tune in to se this great cartoon it is very hard to find the season dvd so if somebody finds a store that is selling it please let me know the only catscratch merchandise available on nick shop is a great lookin shirt but very very very expensive if you love spongebob and who doesn''t you'll love catscratch too,1
some of the acting was a bit suspect i remember that asswipe alexander walker evening standard critic yeah ok he's now dead launched into a rant about this film saying it was a disgrace portraying ni protestants as murderers now with respect to all ni protestants this film was loosely based on the shankill butchers who were loyalists and who roamed belfast in the 1970's believe me they were not called butchers for nothing my main moan about this film is the it shows no ray of light or hope it's all doom gloom i mean did the little girl at the end have to die maybe this sounds corny but it could have taken the tact that not all prods tiags are bad or wholly good either,1
this is one of the shallowest episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun but i appreciated this light hearted approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level think about it the crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and alice from wonderland a bengal tiger a samurai warrior a knight on horseback who kills mccoy and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just don't make any sense at all until the very end despite all the danger you just can't take everything very seriously it's just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal so on a purely non aesthetic level it's great stuff,1
br br this movie is by far one of my favorites i saw it while in college in the early 90's and while i couldn't identify with the thirtysomethings in the film i felt that the story characters and movie in general were top notch to the people who spoke negatively of indian summer feel free to stick to your overblown armageddon type movies and leave the movies with a great wholesome story to those who can appreciate them,1
anyone who saw the original 1970 movie knows how an excellent cast script and director can put together a comedy masterpiece by the same token it's easy to see how the opposite of that can create another insipid hollywood bore a thon this movie was pathetic had it not been for john cleese a comic genius i would have walked out about 15 minutes into this dreadful waste of celluloid br br neil simon wouldn't write another screenplay for this version he said that he couldn't improve on the first and i'm surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he wouldn't sue for defamation of humor br br jack lemmon and sandy dennis did such a wonderful job in the original what were the producers thinking about when they cast this one how could the director and editor look at these scenes and think any of them were funny i don't know but one thing i do know it's no surprise why foreign and independent movies are becoming more and more popular,0
the last wave is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind the title refers to the aboriginal doomsday theory there will be one last wave that wipes out everything br br david burton richard chamberlain is a sydney lawyer hired to defend some aborigines accused of murder around this time there has been unusually heavy rainfall in australia while defending the aborigines david learns the last wave theory and begins to wonder whether it's just mythology br br the movie's last sequence is a metaphor for descending into the depths of one's mind peter weir created a perplexing but thought provoking movie aboriginal actor david gulpilil whom you may have seen in walkabout crocodile dundee and rabbit proof fence provides an interesting supporting role as one of the defendants br br if you get a chance watch the making of feature on the dvd peter weir explains some of the film's undertones some of which relate to richard chamberlain's background,1
heart pounding erotic drama are the words that come to mind when i think of secret games it becomes more erotic as the film goes along and at one point blew me away i didn't expect the delightful scene i was about to encounter the call girl has her first customer and what a customer one of the most erotic lesbian scenes i have ever seen the husband should have listened to his wife and perhaps she wouldn't have gone on this erotic journey it turned out to cost them in the end but it was one exciting ride go see this movie,1
worst movie ever made please see the real movie reviews from the pros on this movie check rotten tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this film the comments made on this site are apparently from folks with some financial interest in this film i find the positive comments very misleading i find it amazing how the negative comments are so bad against this movie and the positive comments sound like an academy awards speech don't waste your hard earned money this film is retarded i can't believe a film like this would ever be made why would hollywood waste their time on such junk this film is an attempt at nothing i ask myself what looser would actually sink their money producing such trash i went to blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste our time or money i didn't listen and i did waste my time and cash please don't make the same mistake it really is the worst movie ever made,0
on one level this film can bring out the child in us that just wants to build sandcastles and throw stuff in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall down again on a deeper level though it explores a profound desire to reconnect with the land i thoroughly empathized with the artist when he said when i'm not out here alone for any length of time i feel unrooted br br i considered andy goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists i'm familiar with his works mainly through his coffee table books and a couple art gallery installations but to see his work in motion captured perfectly through riedelsheimer's lens was a revelation unfrozen in time goldsworthy's creations come alive swirling flying dissolving crumbling crashing br br and that's precisely what he's all about time the process of creation and destruction of emergence and disappearing of coming out of the void and becoming the universe and back again there's a shamanic quality about him verging on madness you get the feeling watching him at work that his art is a lifeforce for him that if he didn't do it he would whither and perish br br luckily for us goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography otherwise with the exception of a few cairns and walls they would only exist for one person,1
i have to admit that i'm a great fan of this show so you must know how disappointed i got when i watched this movie first of all the plot was awful i thought it was going to be something more interesting like to see what happened to arnold fathers or something more interesting but nooooooo a maniac wants to destroy arnold's house between many other places so many people tries to stop this br br i must admit that the plot wasn't so bad after all but what really sucked were the steps that arnold and his friends do to stop this maniac they become friends of a spy they drive a bus based on a video game for god sake and to worse everything they make super moves on the bus things that many persons had already tried and died but not arnold gerald and helga 'cause they are experts on a video game br br honestly my mom my sister even me got really disappointed after watching this movie 'cause it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon i must admit that i used to enjoy hey arnold it was one of my favorite cartoons on nickelodeon but after this crap of movie i'm not quite sure if i'm going to watch hey arnold as i used to watch it on the past br br other thing nickelodeon with that enormous number of dynamite i can assure you that not a simple street would explode i think that the whole city could explode with that oh and please if all of your future movies from good cartoons are going to be like that don't do more movies you give a bad critic to cartoons that used to be good br br honestly i think this was the worst way to end this show a good show transformed into this crap of movie,0
and so the great rewriting of history continues hollywood style br br this was senseless ridiculous rubbish br br its shocks me that such an amazing amount of money can be spent to produce what is the most contrived poorly acted inaccurate film i have ever seen it is appalling br br nic cage's brief flirtation with serious acting appears to be over i can only assume that leaving las vegas was a glitch in an otherwise litany of dreadful films br br diane kruger proves that her performance in troy was no fluke she really can't act br br harvey keitel should be ashamed of himself for working on such tripe br br only recommended for those either recovering from a recent lobotomy or people of an opinion that america invented the world,0
this movie was as homer simpson would have put it more boring than church maybe i don't understand it well enough and i thought it started out pretty well but after start of spoiler hermann braun is sent to jail and maria starts working sleeping with her boss it just started to drag and i struggled to keep awake again maybe it symbolizes something but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place end of spoiler in the end i fail to see why others think it's so great as i found it extremely boring by the way i did not watch this movie by my own free will as i was required to see it for a film class,0
this movie was for a while in my collection but it wasn't before a friend of mine reminded me about it  until i decided that i should watch it i did not know much about close to leo  just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of age movie and it deals with a very serious topic  aids br br although the person who has aids  is leo  the scenario wraps around the way in which marcel the youngest brother of leo coupes with the sickness of his relative at first everyone is trying to hide the truth from marcel  he is believed to be too young to understand the sickness of his brother  the fact that leo is also a homosexual contributes to the unwillingness of the parents to discus the matter with the young marcel i know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young this does not automatically means that he will not be able to accept the reality and act in more adequate manner then even themselves with exception of the fact that the family tried to conceal the truth from marcel they have left quite an impression for me  the way they supported their son  even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and his sickness the fact that they allowed the young marcel to travel along with leo to paris to meet his ex boyfriend was quite a gesture from them most families i know will be reluctant to do that there is a lot of warmth in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time together  you can see them being real friends concern about each other br br close to leo is an excellent drama which i strongly recommend,1
i have just watched the movie for the first time i wanted to watch it as i like drew barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies br br the movie is about a girl played by young and beautiful drew barrymore who moves from nyc to la in order to get over her recently troubled loss short after moving to a guy who falls in love with her it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin doppelganger who haunts her br br the movie is quite poor and lousy both the dialogs and the acting make the film not really worth seeing it summing up it is just something for the fans of drew barrymore,0
this movie is more lupin then most especially coming from funimation other then the bad dub it isn't bad br br the first hour is a lot like the comic which is what all lupin the 3rd stuff is based on lupin's trying to get a huge treasure fujiko's using lupin's weakness to women to try to get something out of it the last bit isn't that bad he's with another women but of course fujiko's still him number one br br a lot of the other lupin movies are more family with cuss words then lupin any good lupin fan i think will be pleasantly surprised i know i was after hearing so many bad things about this movie it might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits they make it a little mushy but overall it isn't a bad film good enough to be one of the few i'd watch again of the lupin iii movies,1
i remember that the trailer for legend of zu was quite impressive and being a fan of a man called hero my all time favourite storm riders i decided that i must watch this one too i know that there is way to much critcism on ekin cheng's acting ability everywhere but he is my favourite hong kong moviestar so far way better than nicolas tse nevertheless and he is one of the factors that i enjoyed this movie without a doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end i even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated by the end of this film they must have put a lot of work into this one and they deserve good credit for that the storyline of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil with a love story thrown in i guess ekin cheng pulls the girls easily the story is not very intellectual and deep but that is not what you expect when watcing an action movie i wished there were more martial arts action with fists and fist instead of battles with magical abilities but well that's life and it never goes the way you want it to and why did they sound like supersonic planes in the battle through the sky in the end that's way too funny legend of zu cannot be a man called hero in my eyes but it flows like a videogame and that is not a bad thing at all if a company decides to publish games on this movie i will not get suprised as it carries all the videogames elements good work please make more fantasy movies like this,1
what kind of sh t is this power rangers vs freddy it was watchable and as good as the first film in the beginning but from the part where the protagonists get super powers in theirs dreams it started to become childish this sh t should have been rated pg or pg 13 rather than r i expected to see some very mature stuff but it was only for the 1 3 of the film the rest are for little kids plus it's focused too much on christianity i know freddy's a demon but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons why does it always have to be christianity this is total orientalism and filled with white men westerner's superiority don't' watch this show it to little kids who loves power rangers,0
i jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted remembering rahs and raves for it but wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary it backed off and went somewhere else the dripping water throughout the house the black rain the prophetic dreams taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream br br what a disappointment chamberlain's nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief something i found myself mirroring as the film wore on what could have been eerie aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one's head the ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods that the aboriginal peoples believe red haired white men were the first priests and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension the dream time br br spoiler in the final scene it wasn't clear to me what the director was trying to tell is there a big wave so what how big a tsunami yeah okay that's devastating but not apocalyptic is it the end of the world from a wave the last wave that'd have to be a pretty darn big wave why was the world that bad a place it didn't seem so awful in this movie actually i didn't think the wave came off since the shadow left burton's face that had been cast by the wave was it only burton's apocalypse heck that happens every day to people who lose it it wasn't of any interest if it was only him br br the most frightening scene and the one that gives the best indication of weir's potential was in charlie's apartment where burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring burton's wife charlie keeps asking him who are you and it becomes truly disturbing after a while unfortunately the movie never followed suit,0
solino really moved me with its deeply drawn characters while being a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers it was not simply about hate or jealousy what i liked most about the movie was how i could identify with the feelings gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into to see this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father was so brave and as in real life most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children i could even identify with giancarlo the brother who while being the more self assured and elder brother had so many insecurities a really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry,1
when i watched this film the first time it was a taped copy and the title was is caged terror i still own the tape and i confess i've watched it more than once from beginning to end the film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unintentionally amusing i have gotten a few of my friends to watch this and we've had some great laughs from the terrible script the film concerns a couple remember this is like early 70's so they are just too hip man who go on a week end camping trip in what i believe was supposed to be upstate ny they have some hilarious dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl bemoans the death of the fish and that they ate it the guy comes back with something goofy about how they ate the fish and now it was a part of them and he goes and that's beautiful man heavy man really heavy lol anyway along come a couple of vietnam vets one of who plays the flute i believe at any rate they are musical fellows the guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple prove unfriendly they end up terrorizing them during the night the guy ends up caged in a chicken coop and has to watch his girl friend being ravished by the two guys actually by the end of the night she seems to be pretty into it and when morning comes the guys leave and the girl and guy are free to leave supposedly the guy has learned a lesson about how to treat people and the girl has a smile on her face anyway i would recommend this film highly to anyone looking for a damn good laugh it never fails to amuse me anyway if i could find this on dvd and replace my old tape copy i'd actually buy it again it's classic camp you gotta love this stuff,1
since this is part 2 then compering it to part one br br man that was on many places wierd too many time jumps etc br br i have to say that i was really disapointed br br only someplaces little lame action and thats it br br they could have done that better br br,0
john carradine john ireland and faith domergue who as players all saw better days in better films got together for this grade g horror film about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion br br for carradine it was in those last two decades of his career that he appeared in anything on the theory it was better to keep working no matter what you did and get those paychecks coming in with that magnificent sonorous voice of his carradine was always in great demand for horror pictures and the man did not discriminate in the least in what he appeared in br br he plays the caretaker of an old gothic mansion who movie director john ireland has rented for his latest low budget slasher film it's even got a graveyard but with a missing occupant faith domergue is ireland's aging star and carole wells is the young ingenue br br in the last twenty minutes or so most of the cast winds up dead that aren't dead already the script is so incoherent i'm still trying to figure out the point i won't waste any more gray matter on it,0
after the initial shock of realizing the guts of mr branagh to film this i was literally shaking with the excitement of having this epic just ahead of me i was not disappointed so true to shakespeare and yet so accessible it blew my mind i always enjoy seeing or rather listening to branagh and it made me wonder is this movie dubbed in other countries that would be like painting a moustache on the mona lisa,1
well here i go with another b industry movie it's sad enough to see some badly made films but i don't care if a b industry or c industry produces the film show some effort in your work the characters are really bad the acting isn't in question in this one surprise but plot is how can a tight knit squad witness two of their fellow soldiers butchered and then go on as if nothing happened what sickened me was how the writer even threw in the remaining members a scene where they joke about how nice the doctor's ass was give me a break,0
imagine pulling back the mask of a lethal assassin and finding barbara cartland there that's what happens with this film br br the opening showed promise but soon it drops all pretenses of being a thriller or even an imaginative love story and the only reason they made this story becomes abundantly clear to fill a gap in their female viewing market by creating yet another re hash of 'mis understood brooding bad boy' andrei meets 'innocent whimsical beauty' paula br br rather than waste any time in creating an original premise the filmmakers went straight for the money shot the bad boy being tamed by said whimsical beauty thence follows a string of insincere and heavily clichéd love scenes sprinkled with pseudo philosophical poetic fluff andrei's admission of being eponymously a 'poet' is levered in to round out the perceived qualities a byronic hero should have but even when we're told in heavy underlined writing who and what he is it's still difficult to believe it or care br br for a byronic hero antihero to work the story needs subtlety style and innovation all of which are utterly absent here this is not a modern day phantom of the opera it's just what happens when a weak and rather silly woman with loose knicker elastic dates a bad man who after meeting her seems as dangerous as bunny slippers br br the performances might have saved this film had they been any good the female lead is preoccupied with looking sexy and 'otherworldly' no matter how forced or ridiculous and poor dougray scott appears to have been drugged as he shambles through his part this is not his best work the glimmers of interest were brought by jürgen prochnow as 'vashon' and andrew lee potts as the young photographer brother a better movie would have offed the sister and kept the brother instead,0
sure we all like bad movies at one time or another and we in fact enjoy them this however wasn't even a guilty pleasure it was just crap some guy vince offer who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk high probably both and thought it was a great idea to make a movie he then proceeded to show his script to equally high drunk individuals overall this movie was so bad predictable and unoriginal i couldn't get through 20 minutes of it before i turned it off it makes you got served look like citizen kane bat man wtf some guy that walks around with a bat real original almost as good as calling him fat man and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit,0
this oddity in the new doris day collection doesn't really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than 30 minutes what she does do however is shine when she's on screen the near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some warner contract players of the day jancie rule shows promise and it's a shame she didn't become a big star ruth roman handles the role of the go getter with aplomb better if this was in color the travis air force base locations with some rear projection work well what's best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes if you enjoyed thank your lucky stars and hollywood canteen you'll like this one,0
i watched this film in shire joy br br this is possibly one of the best films of all time it has a timeless value you can get so much out of it it's amazing there are parts that are moving funny and just great br br all aspect are spot on the portrayal of the story is perfect every detail is 100 genuine even small irish subtleties have been covered br br the use of low and high shots gives two great views on cristy look out for that br br daniel day lewis's performance is incredible i've never seen an actor do that ever it really is amazing br br and it's so great to watch it flows so well it's probably the closest thing yo can get to real life experience i love it br br if you haven't seen it you should see it don't have any doubts on it there is something there for all,1
in my years of attending film festivals i have seen many little films like this that never get theatrical distribution and they end up in the 3 bins at walmart i just found dvd of yank tanks there great doc but how sad for it to end up as a rock bottom remainder br br i loved this film wish i'd seen it at the cinema in it's everything i'd have preferred that new yorker films had translated the title directly it's good for americans to stretch a little if the film's title helps the us audience to explore random chaos all the better cinema imitates life visa versa br br also i found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars come on the euro is not hard to figure out make the gringo audiences do the math seeing a film especially one shot in paris the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded i am an american watching a movie and they are translating the euros into dollars for me br br looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer director as well,1
if there was a god he would have made sure this movie stayed in the toilet were it was crapped up this is by far the worst vampire movie i have ever seen i may never watch a vampire film again because of this movie it makes zombie lake look like the sound of music,0
they probably should have called this movie the map because the majority of the whole stupid film is revolved around a map of a cemetery not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the map there are the only thing they show more than the map itself is the little beads of sweat that is constantly building up on the forehead of our main character this of course was the film makers way of showing us how incredibly tense things are getting up on the immortal hills cemetery come on now couldn't they have shown us just one of the death scenes we hear a whole lot about how everyone who is listed on the map is dropping like flies but we don't get to see anything some how i bury the living manged to keep my attention so i was fairly generous with the rating i gave it but i will not recommend this movie to anyone unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweat i recommend renting a better i movie such as i spit on your grave or i drink your blood,0
this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen there is absolutely no storyline the gags are only for retards and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching in the whole movie fredi oh my god what a funny name ha ha doesn't ask himself once how he came from a plane to middle earth there are plenty of stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny e g gandalf is called almghandi sam is called pupsi and so on i didn't even smile once during the whole movie the gags seem like they were made by people whose iq is negative if you laugh when someone's coat is trapped in the door this happens about 5 times then this movie is perhaps for you another funny scene they try to guess the code word for a closed door don't ask why don't ever ask why in this movie and the code word is ha ha dung so if you laughed at this examples you might like this movie for everybody else go to youtube and watch lord of the weed it's a lot lot more fun,0
sure he became rapidly uneven after this film but from knife in the water up till the tenant roman polanski could always be counted on to deliver something fascinating and unique despite many running themes alienation paranoia no two of his films are really alike the story of this is somewhat similar to his own repulsion from ten years earlier but the tone is completely different the tenant manages to balance darker than dark absurdity i'm a bit hesitant on calling it humor even though the protagonists bizarre behavior and dialog was occasionally funny with some truly suspenseful paranoia polanski was always a master at building unease and moments in this film are almost unbearably creepy the overall weirdness of the film is also a plus br br in addition to polanski's exquisite as usual direction the rest of the cast and crew offer great contributions polanski the actor is often overshadowed by polanski the director but his performance here truly captures his characters awkwardness and sense of being an outcast the themes of social discrimination make this film more than just strangeness for the sake of being strange the rest of the cast offers strong performances also especially isabelle adjani's sympathetic turn and melyvn douglas and shelley winters' appropriately annoying ones the tenant is often underrated because of how ready people are to heap praise on both repulsion and rosemary's baby but its just as brilliant as either of those classics 9 10,1
i've just finished viewing the 1st disc in a 4 disc 26 episodes collection created in conjunction with the ucla film television archive s'more entertainment inc so far aside from the 1st episode the image quality is quite good the dvd box is shown on the title page here on imdb br br mr peepers is just as charming as when i first saw it 5 years old at the time and wally cox is truly endearing in this role if you're in the mood for quiet comedy that sneaks up on you as opposed to hitting you over the head you'll treasure this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you might remember from your childhood although some of the gags are a bit corny most are ingenious and well executed and even the corny ones are fun this is one tv series that lives up to my early childhood memories of it,1
what i loved about the on screen adaptation of the stone angel is that it stayed so true to the novel great film as an avid reader i find the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation you can tell the stone angel team was careful not to let this happen with this film br br ellen burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar however i think the canadian actress christine horne chosen to play hagar in her younger years also did an incredible job that warrants great praise i haven't seen any of horne's previous work but i will definitely seek it out after seeing her stone angel performance br br i heard the canadian theatrical release of the stone angel is going to happen in spring or summer 2008 i can't wait to see it on the big screen again,1
like another reviewer said this movie is not a heavy melodrama but it deals with harsh realities a very very playful movie that does not dwell for a moment some very good acting and some wonderful smiles as well,1
ivan reitman is something of a savior the most tired plots ghostbusters evolution come to life in his skilled hands even his occasional flop six days seven nights show signs of life and humor that make it worth viewing so i was disappointed that reitman could not take a fairly original plot man dumps superhero superhero gets superpower fueled revenge and shape it into something enjoyable girlfriend is an exercise in pointlessness the one trick pony plot is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes the film can't decide whether to be romantic comedy or superhero drama the result is a film the flip flops between both with neither aspect being very well done uma thurman is tops as usual and luke wilson pulls off his role too though his slacker antics quickly grow tired what's even more maddening is that in certain scenes such as when a very turned on uma knocks a headboard through a wall you sense a witty raucous reitman opus practically screaming to get out but seconds later the magic is lost gone as quick as the superheroine whose movies disappoints in almost every way,0
the league of gentlemen is one of the funniest strangest darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time so much so it paved the way for more comedies of its ilk many of which have copied the style but have never succeeded br br unlike every other sketch show around the characters of the league of gentlemen are all loosely connected firstly they all live in the fictional town of royston vasey in the back of beyond of northern england br br the first characters to greet newcomers are tubbs and edwrad the pig faced owners of a supposedly local shop situated so far away most of the residents probably don't know of its existence other oddities include the denton family with an obsession with hygiene chastity and toads hillary briss who sells a special yet thankfully unknown brand of meat pauline a restart officer with a sharp tongue and even sharper pens mr chinnery kind hearted vet and menace to all things four legged geoff tipps a plastics salesman with a vicious sense of humour often involving guns electric tubes and plums br br despite being a comedy at heart the league of gentlemen often transcends genres whilst never appearing to be spoofing or ripping off other people's material there are several horror references such as the disappearance of a hiker a pair of silent twins an obsessive circus owner and a sudden outbreak of nosebleeds even more striking are moments when the series takes on a more sobre tone and aforementioned characters such as pauline and geoff are shown in a more sympathetic vulnerable light the film adaptation is the best demonstration of this but some fans may decide they belong local br br the equally underrated third series also takes a different route instead of sketches each episode focuses on an individual character with each storyline leading to one conclusion involving a plastic bag and a runaway theatre company van although many fans may not enjoy the structure of the film or the third series as much as the first two they're certainly signs to how inventive the league of gentlemen can be and how unafraid to explore new areas br br in short the league of gentlemen is definitely worth a look as like the welcome signs says you'll never leave,1
this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash adorned in black of course who sings a lot and narrates a bit also if you like johnny cash this film is quite enjoyable also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this work just for fun try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair anyway its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all,1
this is a very entertaining film which follows the rehearsal process of a ny production of macbeth although it has a lot to say about power jealousy and ambition the themes of macbeth in our modern world the film works best when it is not taking itself too seriously recognizable actors such as john glover gloria reubens and david lansbury do nice jobs in the main roles but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where the murder of banquo john elsen is rehearsed probably a more entertaining film for those involved in theatre but anyone who enjoys shakespeare should enjoy this film,1
whoa nelly i've heard a ton of mixed reviews for this but one of my go to hardcore horror reviewers really found it to be disappointing man was he right on the nose this movie was acted by pure amateurs they had to have done one take maybe two on each scene the movie seemed soooo rushed the script was also poor they had lines that tried to be unique but failed miserably get your meathooks off of me oh man i hate it when movies try to do that it happens all the time with comedies but with a horror movie and with below average actors the results are incredibly pathetic the lines and scenarios were all very predictable but what made me feel so negative towards this movie was again the damn acting it was awful besides by the little asian guy who worked the booth i thought he was great br br the movie is about 5 stupid dumbsh t tourist who are on a vacation in asia they end up at the wrong place and fall into the hands of a mafia run sex slaughterhouse sounds like a cool story but watching someone with a bad case of diarrhea is probably more fun and intense to watch the only reason this is considered horror is because of the killing there wasn't a trace of suspense br br i like many other horror fans were dying to get their bloody little mitts on this but unfortunately with a huge capital u the movie was incredibly disappointing i did enjoy the ankle break and the blood effects the flabby chicks were also so so br br everything about this movie screams amateur this is ryan nicholson's first feature length and for the most part he failed there's no denying he has a sick sense of humor and taste for horror i pray his next movie doesn't play out like another b horror flick unless he tells us that's what it's gonna be even after this disappointment i'm willing to give ryan another shot from what i've seen of him he's a true dedicated man to the genre good luck next time because this was bad news,0
i tried watching this abomination of the cinema when i was five years old i have never been the same since filled to the brim with drug induced images that reek of the common ravings of your average asylum resident this movie despite its colorful appearance is not for humans especially not children br br it starts out innocently enough with a poor boy who ruins his classmate's drum by wait for it putting his head through it yes putting his head through it but fear not my friends he is quickly consoled by his chirping flute which is weird enough i'll grant you but still acceptable br br then the movie morphs into a combination of wizard of oz and where the wild things are but loses all the warm and fuzzy aspects of either of these two books br br so this seven foot yellow relative of barney befriends this poor boy and plunges him even deeper into despair br br and to add the pleasant array of horrific themes a carnivorous boat formerly a friend of the motley crew of hobbling grandfather clocks and doped up dragons is added to the mix of mayhem br br the most comforting image in the midst of this chaos is the villain aptly dubbed witchiepoo of course she has problems of her own what with an obvious plastic mask constricting her facial expressions to having to deal with a broomstick whose gas level always seemed to be at its lowest at the most inopportune moments as a result of this one of her favorite pastimes was nose diving into the body of water that separated the land of pufnstuf from her degenerate decaying abode i don't know where i would have preferred to live br br in summary this movie is terrifying br br if you want to watch the movie that has similar effects on its audience as the exorcist then this one is for you enjoy,0
'cry freedom' is a movie about how far people will go to find the truth br br the first half is an interesting portrayal of an unlikely friendship between activist steve biko and editor don woods played fanatically by dezel washington and kevin klein while the second half deals with woods looking for answers on biko's death br br although most people favor the first half of the movie which focuses on the unlikely friendship between biko and woods' i found the second half about don woods struggle to have biko's story be heard around the world much more interesting,1
good movies are original some leave a message or touch you in a certain way but sometimes you're not in the mood for that br br i wanted something simple no thinking just plain action when i watched this one it started of good and was quite entertaining so why a bad review well in the end the movie lost it's credibility the storyline wasn't that cheesy at all the action was not too special but overall good acting was ok so more than enough to satisfy my needs but all got ruined because things happened that were over the top and it left me with a bad feeling they should have put a little more effort in making everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the no thinking just plain action category so in conclusion if you know you'll get irritated because things are happening that seem completely illogical don't watch otherwise i'd say go ahead,0
yeah well i definitely had regrets about giving up my saturday night watching this strange little yet very long movie apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life here's the epitome of the antihero in 'no regrets ' we have this jerk so messed up so wandering so selfish aimless and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly favored businessman's up and coming son jaemin unless it was just that physical attraction he claims otherwise that it's love but after watching this it's like loving charles manson because you dig the beard alright he's not that bad but still no real redeemable characteristics i could never get past the reason jaemin endless stalks sumin it was never shown just told that jaemin loves sumin perhaps it's a culture thing that flew over my head crazy stalking mad love over in seoul it has to be because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point i thought this was turning into a screwball comedy i was waiting for a tiger named baby to make an appearance okay so sumin works two jobs while going to school so far so good on someone trying to better themselves but after his first taste of his stalker's attraction he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring what ok well as previously mentioned the obsession doesn't stop due to the job career change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable occurrences just seem to happen without buildup basic movie not 100 terrible but you can do better with foreign gay themed movies,0
yeah stupidity i just finish watching and i still have bad taste in my mouth too much colors too much unnecessary addons to a story too much stupid characters i presume they wanted to achieve comic relief but i only wanted to cry too much of everything shame to spoil one of divine stories from arabian nights like this childish naive both on a bad way and with lot of magic breaking mistakes i don't think this could keep a child of five for more then ten minutes princess is lovely but should be tongueless cause actress don't know how to carry a role rest of the cast is even worse our bad guy is really bad shame that the good guy is not better only light in this dark is of course david carradine who goes unfortunately deeply down under his level with this but at least keep his actor fighter skills at top i'm still sorry to see him in a thing like this but glad that i had something to watch in whole charade so thank you david only only for him i give this 2 stars to this fiasco i would give more for him but that would rise final score to entire movie the rest is so bad that i would maybe like to grade it but there is no grade lover then 1 here and i think that would be too much,0
finally a thriller which omits the car chases explosions and other eye catching effects the movie combines a simple plot assasination of a french president with an excellent background it takes a look behind mans behavior with authorities and explains why we would obey almost every order even murder which would be given to us br br furthermore it shows us how secret services can manipulate the run of history and how hardly they can be controlled the best thing on this movie is that there is no classic hollywood end which can easily be predicted,1
most people know paul verhoeven as the director of many good and bad sci fi movies in hollywood but long before that he was churning out generic thrillers in his native land the story is a basic femme fatale premise nothing new or enthralling verhoeven thinks he can make it better by adding in a series of dream sequences which instead of defining our main character and his situation are just used as a way to drive forward the predictable plot the screenplay was solid the dialogue helping to pad the effects of the bland story what really made the movie at at least good was some terrific acting jereone krabbe was amazing as the tortured artist and the supporters were very good as well also jan de bont's cinematography adds at least some life to the film helping to make verhoeven look at least capable as a director br br 6 5 10 br br 1 2,1
nothing to say but wow has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field well this happens about 25 times in this movie clearly the directors' favorite scare tactic in one of the opening scenes the smooth talking hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film shortly after he arrives to the field the 5 contestants show up and although it is clearly at latest 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute after about 30 minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clown's history in which we see some of his previous victims if you watch this movie check out the ladies chest her ribs go all the way to her neck it was flat out disgusting most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day the few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the blair witch project or random shots from the directors backyard the movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically br br definitely rent this movie if you have ever been snuck up on in an open field br br signed the answer,0
gandhi as a husband and father has always been discussed by people in india 'gandhi my father' is a story that only a few would have known to such details surely an insight into gandhi's personal life br br overall i liked the movie for story and cinematography jariwala akshay khanna and shefali shah have all done a good job most scenes of the movie would be nice desktop wallpapers commendable job traditional indian folk music as background score during certain parts of the movie gives a good feel of the happenings br br however what i didn't quite like was the narration style at several points i found the tone over dramatized br br overall good work by anil kapoor productions i would recommend it as must watch once 8 10,1
i saw this movie in the first couple of weeks it was out i don't remember exactly when i thought that it was alright for a ben stiller movie this movie isn't for a person without a good sense of humor like most of ben stiller's jokes you have to think about them or like i said you have a good sense of humor from a couple of people on this website i saw that people didn't have anything good to say about it and it didn't get a very good rating but i would have given it a larger one this movie i thought was very good and it should have gotten a better rating maybe this isn't a movie for you i'm just giving you another person's opinion,1
i wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules this movie is aweful from the acting to the non realistic animation to the countless errors i was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination can't extend flaps without engines the landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity that tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear the one thing i thought was quite peculiar is when they landed the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air how did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that weren't touching the ground did they forget the spoilers word to the director find out all you can about planes before attempting a plane movie sorry for the technical rant but i give this movie 1 10,0
if this is the first of the nemesis films that you have seen then i strongly urge you to proceed no further the sequels to nebula prove to be no better hard to believe considering this entry is bottom of the barrel this movie tries but it's just not worth your time folks take a nap instead,0
my wife and i rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and office space blockbuster and imdb even had it as an also recommended selection if you liked office space br br now i've seen office space probably 15 or 20 times i love it it's probably one of my 10 favorite movies witty humorous and featuring characters that remind me of people i've worked with over the years haiku tunnel is similar to office space in that they are both films that's where the similarity ends we sat through probably the first 50 minutes of ht giving it the benefit of the doubt hoping nay praying that it would get better it didn't we couldn't take it any more and stopped the tape thank god it was a free rental i'd have been p ed if we'd actually paid for it we should be reimbursed for having to sit through it now since we didn't see the end perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself i doubt it br br haiku tunnel is so bad it's hard to believe it ever got produced the movie is so unfunny it's painful just mail the friggin letters already the premise is asinine the jokes are awful we got as far as the printer doesn't work scene and had to stop we couldn't take it anymore this film is an embarrasment for josh kornbluth br br if you are a fan of office space don't waste your time with this turd 0 10,0
despite a decent first season this series never came close to realizing its potential set as a prequel to the original star trek series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer rick berman who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a star trek series could be which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint the actual show runner brannon braga didn't help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchise's internal mythology it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck never have i seen a series' that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors jolene blaylock excepted last so long it is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience even a trekker audience is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires unfortunately it appears as if berman and braga have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at paramount that enterprise suffered from franchise fatigue and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they the audience will come br br simply put in a teevee universe where we are given shows like battlestar galactica and the shield the powers that be must give the viewing public a star trek that measures up and is dramatically competitive it is just that straightforward and easy,0

i loved this film seen this evening on a movie theatre big screen the audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things and the fast pace was most enjoyable br br i do as a singer and musical director question one section of roby keeler's vocal in by a waterfall the key modulated and she was suddenly singing much lower in a very mellow voice that bore no resemblance to the somewhat tin like higher twitter voice she used in all her other vocals br br does anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer it sounds it to me i would love to know br br thanks so much,1
i remember seeing this in a the salem movie theater where i used to attend kiddie matinée s almost every saturday in dayton ohio when i was a young boy and have never forgotten it it simply amazed me and my friends i do wish there were some way i could see it again i have tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that to no avail i only recently discovered that it was a cousteau film and that blew my mind even more how the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding the fish is actually in the cat's mouth at one point if i remember correctly if anyone could help me find a way to see it again i would be extremely grateful,1

i don't what that other review was talking about this definitely isn't a bimbo movie in fact i don't think there was one decent looking girl in it no it's just cheesy poorly done ed wood style science fiction schlock and it's bad i can't even begin to tell you how bad it is i saw it late at night on cable and i was in shock the fact that this movie was ever released is an insult to us all the actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded the special effects are a joke and the pace is insanely slow to me though the music tops it all a monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone do not rent this thing but if you ever see it on cable watch it you'll be amazed at how bad a movie can be,0
i started to watch this movie expecting nothing just another movie to watch but since the first twenty minutes the artwork and main character who is enigmatic doesn't talk much really got me in this movie br br i really liked this movie it was dark beautifully acted and really touching it's a bit slow but the immersion was complete the directing was awesome by letting us know bits by bits the story leading to the conviction of joey and his life behind bars the music was really great and very well incorporated into the scenes the ending was unexpected with a twist i didn't see coming it's not the kind of movie we see often,1
i watched part one two days ago and today i saw part two of course the two parts are worlds apart so i am a little shaken by all that i just saw i felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of che's death for me it clouded the entire movie i suppose that is exactly what soderbergh wanted us to feel the slowly evolving inevitability of his death part two was so downbeat compared to again an inevitability but in cuba it was positive and in bolivia it was so negative the politics of the movement in bolivia were only alluded to but rarely confronted didactically for me the memorable scenes were all at the end of the film the confrontation with the jailer and the milder talk with the bolivian official where that official questions che about the failure of the peasants to support his revolution i had not considered the national differences playing as much role as they did in the conflict argentine versus bolivian i thought soderbergh dealt admirably with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle how do you get food without antagonizing the peasants who do not have enough themselves i was struck by how hard it would be to try something as che tried i guess it is all in the timing is there sufficient anger against the government to begin the movement in bolivia there wasn't che realized the terrible corundum of revolutionists in his letter to fidel read at the beginning of the film if not now when 50 years from now a very thought provoking and well done film make every effort to see it,1
it's the same old if i can't get the funding for my project i'll inject myself monster movie there is nothing new here it's a lot like the jeff goldblum fly movie the man manages to keep some semblance of sanity but eventually succumbs to the effects of his experiments the acting is pretty bad there are people acting stupidly all along the way putting their lives in danger for no apparent reason the guy keeps going back to the lab he has been forbidden to enter then there's his relationship with a young woman and her son admittedly he is good looking but he seems like a lot of trouble it's just a pretty big waste of time even his tyrannosaurus suit looks like it came off the rack at a star trek convention,0
tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary pickford's films at two hours it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a greatest hits performance with bits of mary the innocent mary the little devil mary the little mother mary the spitfire mary the romantic heroine etc characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character's illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our little mary is thought the unwed mother in question if the academy awards had been around in 1922 no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been mary's,1
well then what is it i found nicholson's character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting angelica huston's character drained my power and kathleen turner is a filthy no good slut it's not that i don't get it it's not that i don't think that some of the ideas could've lead to something more this is a film with nothing but the notion that we're supposed to accept these ideas and that's what the movie has going for it that nicholson falls for turner is absurd but then again it is intended to be so this however does not strike me as a funny or b even remotely interesting this was a waste of my time so don't let the hype get the best of you it is a waste of your time with all that being said the opening church sequence is quite beautiful,0
while bondarchuk was by no means a young man when he was commissioned to work on this project he was still a novice director with only a single pictures a successful adaptation of a short wwii story to his name bondarchuk of course had already been an established acting star for a decade but thespian skills mean little behind the camera and as a director he was woefully unprepared to undertake a production of such scale and it shows through muddled shot compositions especially apparent in group scenes often unfortunate camera positions performances of wildly varying quality for the director was apparently so overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the task actors were apparently left to their own devices awkward voiceovers that sound like radio broadcast announcements br br vidor's war and peace was probably the main reason that prompted the soviet government to spare no expense on this production the ussr release of the vidor's picture made quite a splash certainly bondarchuk wanted to emulate the greatest strength of the hollywood film and find his own audrey his final choice lyudmila savelyeva a big eyed sprightly dark haired thing indeed somewhat resembles hepburn unfortunately she was a kirov ballet dancer without neither acting experience nor talent so unsurprisingly the most kind word that i can find to describe her performance is awful br br though it might be expected that soviet actors speaking the same language as tolstoy's characters would have better understanding of them than foreigners but this war and peace often proves that not to be the case the revolutionary upheaval swept away the thin upper layer of russian cultural soil that the world of war and peace grown out of so a good share of these big name soviet actors involved in this production often look as clueless as americans performing shakespeare i don't mean of course that american actors can't possibly play shakespeare credibly but you'll know what i mean if you witnessed american members of the cast in branagh's adaptations of the three main characters only bondarchuk's pierre is commendable but even he was too old for the part and feels out of place in the early going,0
an obvious b grade effort to cash in on the hostel saw buzz my expectations for this film were low really low and yet it still managed to disappoint on every level the acting is so bad it's not even funny the plot line is non existent and the only scare was realizing that i had wasted 1hour 21 minutes watching it i'm surprised to note that 34 people gave it a 10 star rating i can only suspect that 33 of these are cast and crew the 34th is possibly the directors mother although i'm sure even she would find it hard to go higher than a 2 dvd extras include an hour long making of feature which raises the question why although perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do avoid at all costs,0
as a disclaimer i've seen the movie 5 6 times in the last 15 years and i only just saw the musical this week this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical however it tainted me when i watched the musical br br i actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role along with kasey i think her 'let me dance for you scene' is one of the best parts of the movie a worthwhile addition compared to the musical the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger easier to do in the movie of course the decors lighting dancing and singing are also much superior in the movie which should be expected and was indeed delivered br br the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few decors the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical,1
unlike the adventures of buckaroo banzai or big trouble in little china or conan the barbarian which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and self deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations the golden child is just plain bad br br the premise itself is not unworkable and there are some funny moments but here the eddy murphy flip attitude just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story and the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension the mystic secrets of tibetan buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compel br br without a feeling that anything is at stake or that the characters are faced by real danger why should we care br br who should see this film br br big fans of eddy murphy who can't help themselves br br i can't think of anyone else br br i'll give this film a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked,0
well what can it be said about this disaster i watched it because it aired on cable i regret for wasting my time but at least i didn't waste money br br the creature is the cheesiest you can get please you need to be very generous not to get angered by the cheap halloween costume oh well there are also displays of horrible acting f x and dialogues the confrontation with the creature is unbelievable you can't get a more pathetic scene br br this is the worst you can get from direct to video flicks creature unknown makes full moon pictures movies look like halloween br br avoid this one at all costs please the only positive thing about this trash are the sexy women,0
what a bad bad film i can't believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious amateurish excuse for a real movie i left the theater before the end stunned by how bad the direction and camera work of that movie were and to read adoring paeans that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a brazen attempt at pulling the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and tawdry br br at least this film showed me once and for all that the sundance festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad film making than anything else br br avoid at all costs you'll want your time back i know i did,0
this movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching sloppy editing little to no continuity insane dialog bad you might even say non existent acting pointless story lines shots that go on far too long and it's perfect for mst3k style riffing not to mention the corpse eaters drinking game scribble on forms take a shot sign your name take a shot catch a bad foley edit take many many shots br br the only reason i didn't rate it higher than 8 is because there's not enough gratuitous nudity and because despite its insane badness it's only an hour long hell a movie like this should have been at least 20 30 minutes longer,1
this movie wasn't absolutely atrocious but it was pretty bad the acting actually was pretty good jeffrey combs did a pretty darn good job as the mad scientist which is sort of his specialty if you don't know such things d bill forsythe well i'm not exactly sure why he was in this film he's way too good for this kinda stuff and his role wasn't exactly demanding i rented this on the strength of those two leads and i wasn't really disappointed i mean heck it's a movie about a half man half shark it ain't shakespeare folks other than the plot which is full of holes and the poor dialogue i would like to note that the cinematography also left many things to be desired there were shots were they were trying to look cool but it ended up obscuring the scene or just coming off plain cheezy they also blew it many times when they had decent dialogue and cut away prematurely before the person could even deliver the line it was pretty bad but if you are a jeffrey combs fan this one is worth checking out he gives a great performance and does what he can with the character forsythe ain't bad either and either is the female lead heck if i can remember her name though bottom line i wouldn't otherwise waste your time,0
i had to give this film a 1 because it's that bad but don't make this think that i didn't enjoy watching because i laughed and laughed and i even had a few questions so half of the time i was laughing half of the time i was saying what in the hell is going on or why would someone do this et cetera i mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects the 80's style nude scene battle dialogue nude scene and the way that the warrior's swords flap in the wind when they ride their horses and there's some crappy model effects those aren't supposed to be real trees are they and i still don't understand this guy that they find in the cave what in the hell is he a friend of mine told me about these movies and i thought i would give em a try and i basically liked the film as people like ed wood films i have no real enjoyment of what the film was meant to be i look at it in my own hilarious way so don't let this distract you if you really thought this was an action movie it is i just liked it for other reasons it's much much worse than evil dead so it can actually make you think as though you are wasting your life by watching it which came into my mind a few times i guess the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks have some friends around and laugh at this film maybe this is a bit harsh but i don't think so rent it and you'll see yo,0
an excellent cast makes this movie work all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and it's clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie br br it's not quite the comedy i expected much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to reclaim youthful glory than bawdy humor for music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funny br br i hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies but so much of this movie reminded me of alan parker films i can't help it imagine if the commitments actually did make it big and then tried to recapture said glory 25 years later,1
documentary about nomadic persians making a treacherous traverse of massive mountains to get their herds to grass watching this silent black and white feature marred in part by a twink twink twink oriental music score that could not have been used in the original exhibition is even duller than it sounds the spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen and there is an utter failure to establish any kind of plot line i loved nanook of the north and march of the penguins but despised this movie notwithstanding the similarity of the theme physical hardships alone are just not that interesting,0
the story is quite original but the movie is kinda slow building up to the point where they steal the cars its kinda nice though to watch them prepare the stealing too but the actual stealing should've been more in picture however the stunt work on this movie was excellent and it is definetly a movie you have to see 7 10,1
i saw this movie two weeks ago at the festival des nouvelles images du japon in paris though i wasn't expecting much from it i have to say i've been disappointed just like many people in the audience if i wanted to sum up how i felt i'd say i've been comparing it to princess mononoke and nausicaa from the beginning to the end of course it's silly but i couldn't help it the stories are quite different but the worlds pictured are very much alike and from this point of view a tree of palme definitely can't stand the comparison with miyazaki's masterworks even if it's quite good technically boredom remains in the end its complete lack of originality makes me advise you not to care to watch it i rated it 2 out of 10 a bit harsh i guess it deserves 3 or 4,0
the question of whether or not one likes this film version of the ghost train invariably depends on one thing and one thing alone your reaction to the performance of arthur askey br br he tends to steal almost every scene he's in and not always in a good way sometimes you wish he'd settle down or back off just a little to allow the plot's many characters to feature and develop which they do to some extent but somehow everything keeps pointing back to askey's tommy gander character br br personally i like the film and even like askey to an extent i always seem to plonk it into the vcr at those odd hours of the early morning when i can't sleep and really can't find the energy to watch anything else there is something about watching old b w movies in the quiet dark of pre dawn that i find appealing,1
richard attenborough who already given us magnific films as a chorus line and gandhi once more surprise us making a beautiful hymn to the nature indeed the vast and in that time unexplored territory of canada helps to compose the stunning beauty of the landscapes picked up by the motion picture camera if the movie is really based on a true story once more becomes evidente that men of vision are in truth men that lives beyond their time with a historical perspective that only the time will give them reason the cinematography is magnificient such as the cast lead by pierce brosnan whose performance is due to attenborough's master hands a pleasing surprise is the appearance of annie galipeau in the role of archie's beloved movie that must appears in a list of those who really loves the nature,1
this movie is just funny mindless but funny to enjoy this movie completely you can't have a perception of how a film like this goes and just enjoy all the side jokes and puns which are involved with the film i still find the bit at the start funny when he says want a beer cock funny stuff but what makes the film decent is the fact that it doesn't try to hard to create a serious spin on the film too many comedies try to have serious aspects which you just don't believe but this is different and just focuses on being funny i must say though yasmin bleeth is terrible in the film and adds nothing but the 3 main guys coop remer and squeak are very funny to watch and make the film great to watch,1
robot jox tries hard but is fundamentally a series of fight scenes strung together robot against robot man against man man against woman the premise had potential but it seems the script wasn't really given the couple of more drafts it needed still it was fairly good for a science fiction action movie part of it was because the script was by joe haldeman for those who aren't familiar with the name haldeman wrote the award winning science fiction novel the forever war it's considered one of the very best powered battle armor novels right up there with robert heinlein's starship troopers and john steakley's armor and this movie is really more like a giant powered battle armor movie rather than giant robots it's closer to what fans would have wanted instead of the travesty that was paul verhoeven's starship troopers which bore only a passing resemblance to the novel it was based on br br despite some assumptions this really isn't based on homer's iliad a couple of names are all they had in common achilles having his robot's foot blown off had no parallel in the iliad which didn't include achilles' death nor was the ancient achilles a noble warrior he was the mightiest but also vengeful and petty even the robot jock killed off in the first scene doesn't fit he was named hercules while the greek iliad would have had herakles br br the effects were fairly good for the time and the budget true it wasn't comparable to terminator 2 a year later but that movie cost ten times as much the stop motion was almost as good as the robotic walkers in the empire strikes back and return of the jedi better in fact than a lot of ray harryhausen animation which is highly regarded but quite dated br br don't bring high expectations into this and you probably won't be disappointed it's better than a lot of other low budget flicks and even some big budget blockbuster wannabes that have better effects but far worse scripts,1
most of the french films i've seen and enjoyed were more talk than action but that's okay i found them interesting well photographed and with intriguing actors however i did at one point wonder if gerald depardieu was in every french film ever made it seemed that way br br this movie has the same interesting visuals and had a good opening but then it became talk talk and more talk which is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery after awhile i almost fell asleep watching this br br actually the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes played out in one room thus if you love plays you should like this but i want a little more bang for a murder story,0
the cowboys could leave you a little sore in the saddle definitely not one of johns best movies don't get me wrong with any john wayne move there is always some good spots and this one has it's fair share but over all the picture moves slow and just doesn't live up to the aspirations it could have been bruce dern again does an outstanding job as the villain roscoe lee brown is another bright spot in the movie the kids in the movie were average but could have been cast better this would be a good movie for the eight to fifteen year old movie goers br br this would be a good family move to watch with your children just be aware there is a couple of scenes that you may want to take a look at before you let the young ones see it but most kids that i know who have seen the movie like it maybe it's because they get to see kids their age do all the grown up work,0
this is the first 10 out of 10 that i've given any movie what made this movie so good for me constant action there isn't any slow parts great acting smart writing i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene finally i get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public i e there's no forced romance br br i liked the first two bourne movies but i loved this one br br warning after watching this movie you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car,1
i'm a fan of both shakespeare and mst3k so i waited anxiously to see this episode i'll comment on the movie first then the mst3k episode the recipe for this movie take talented actors rich and beautiful shakespeare material and a 1 25 budget mix well then drain of all life and movement until dull and lifeless serve cold in a big plain stone cauldron movie i give 3 out of 10 because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit okay now the mst3k episode i'll admit it the first time i saw it i fell asleep halfway through i understand that was the reaction of several other veiwers as well however when i watched it a second time i realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and good lines i missed the first time around the trick with this episode is listen carefully it takes a couple of viewings to catch each line give it a second chance and you'll see what i mean mst3k episode 7 1 2 out of 10,0
i have always admired susan sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor i therefor found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts her character's rescue from the south pole was done by a canadian charter company from edmonton alberta flying a canadian designed and built twin otter aircraft the trip had been turned down by the us airforce navy and coast guard as beyond their capabilities the same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the south pole base i feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task i fail to see why the producers would find it necessary ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a usaf hercules,0
i found this film to funny from the start john waters use of characters reminded of some of the down to earth characters from fellini films christina ricci has once again expanded her abilities in this film if you are looking for a fun movie without preaching i recommend this film,1
i just viewed detention last night and i liked what i saw it was a cool fun movie dolph looked superbly cool on the bike he also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies he is now in a pretty good shape the story was ok and the other actors were also passable i wouldn't call this movie his best but its still a good movie br br but it also had its share of problems the first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target they should've had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing i dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom the third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers there should've been more bad guys last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy but that was due to the small budget overall the movie was a good movie i enjoyed it i would recommend others to watch it p s now u r a dead beat cop some one liners were also cool br br,1
almost the entire film takes place in a public bathhouse in china there are no fancy sets explosion or glamorous people only fine writing acting and direction hollywood take note br br an estranged son returns home when he believes his father is dying he is surprised to see that dad looks fine and is going about running the family business as usual in fact he notices that his father and his retarded brother have really forged a close and caring relationship and it soon becomes obvious that he is out of the loop dad is very traditional and this visiting son is from the big city and doesn't really see the value of the old bathhouse how their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is exceptional and believable br br i was happy to see that not every chinese movie is an action picture such as those starring jet li or crouching tiger hidden dragon as i don't particularly care for these frenetic films the shower as well as springtime in a small town are two wonderful examples of good chinese films about people,1
certainly any others i have seen pale in comparison the series gives balanced coverage to all theatres of operation no one country is given undue credit for the allied victory laurence olivier brings great weight and dignity to his role as narrator,1
it's sad when you can see what a movie was attempting to do and it is quite obvious that it fell far far short of the mark film students should take this as a lesson and a warning would be graduate has an idea he wants total control so he writes directs produces his cinematic masterpiece all by himself usually his concept is far beyond his budget usually he writes an overblown script full of every tag line he can come up with usually he is more interested in the grand sweep of the story rather than on the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes usually he ends up with a movie that is feeble in it's attempt to create miracles on a tiny budget usually he ends up with a series of encounters we cannot do justice by calling them scenes that feel like they were written by a 12 year old and usually he ends up with badly acted scenes that fail to grab the viewer when you look at judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it's just the usual fare,0
despite reading the initial comments from someone who curiously disliked the film why is the only negative comment very first on the list it was very nice to note that virtually everyone else loved it obviously the church wanted to stress certain points and portray the prophet joseph smith in a positive manner thats the whole idea and in fact those points were extremely effective we already know joseph smith was human but despite that and all of the horrific negative attempts stirred on by the adversary it showed just how he was able to complete a remarkable god given work i'd recommend it to anyone,1
i've long heard that to get their start in 'legitimate' films many behind the camera types work on porno films br br the people who produced and directed this monstrosity stayed too long br br poorly paced staged and written it uses a lot of perfectly good talent diehl dorn eggert badly br br much sexual activity is teasingly implied here by the brassiere popping host to the alien creature but it never crosses the line br br you'll still want to shower afterwards though,0
ok the plot is wait you got me there is no true discernible plot here just a string of optically fogged sex scenes strung together by scenes of photographers taking pictures of pretty ladies sometimes a combination of the two then a demon comes around kills the men rapes and kills the women and waxes poetic about the meaning of life moronic special effects bad acting and bizarre philosophy aside you get what you expect from a film with a title like this i guess it would have to be someone's cup of tea just not mine as i have yet to see a good kazuo 'gaira' komizu directed film br br dvd extras subtitled interview with director kazuo komizu part 1 part 2 is on the entrails of a beautiful woman dvd and theatrical tailer br br my grade f,0
it was very heart warming as an expatriated french i particularly enjoyed this tv movie which i think deserves a broader distribution the acting was good and the bonds between each member of this rural french family seemed so br br strong and so natural no doubt a great movie about the concept of family and inclusion in the face of homosexuality and aids one of the strongest aspect of the movie is this privileged relationship between the eldest son leo who has contracted hiv and the youngest son marcel to whom the rest of the family try to hide the situation the two characters br br progressively explore each other as time runs out for leo who is not willing to spend the rest of his life surviving under drugs,1
rented this one accidentally it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting didn't find out until i got home watched it anyways absolutely fantastic a wonderful movie and one of my top three favorite of all time i recommend it to everyone br br the story is enjoyable and easy to follow this could have been easily messed up but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it together br br the actors themselves are fantastic displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job br br gotta find a copy somewhere,1
the plot doesn't begin to describe the film a man is writing a film or rather this film it's totally self referential to the point that you think it's going to fold in on itself like a black hole the writer writes something and it happens or something happens and he writes about it br br it's very philosophical like waking life but more zen oriented and for that matter much better in my opinion at one point there are person on the street interviews and then you see shots of these people being filmed and then you discover that their responses are scripted when one keeps flubbing her lines there is beautiful scenery and optical illusions br br i hope it comes out on dvd so i can watch it again more carefully seen at cinequest the san jose ca film festival on 2 25 2002,1
sondra locke stinks in this film but then she was an awful 'actress' anyway unfortunately she drags everyone else including then real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer it's an exceptionally weak story basically no story or plot at all add in bored poor acting even from the normally good eastwood there's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers wow could a film be any more boring i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun a real stinker don't bother with this one,0
ok it's not a perfect movie by any means but i disagree with the overall imdb opinion that it's really really bad i watched a lot of hong kong flix in the 1990's and loved the era dearly i never saw 'black mask' at the time and only saw it last week for the first time apart from the embarrassingly poor dubbing which my dvd copy didn't give me the option to turn off the movie contains the raw energy and bravado that permeated hong kong movies during this time i still stick to my guns in the opinion that when it comes to action these guys no matter what their budget add an element of magic to the screen no bourne supremacy casino royale or mission impossible i'm not knocking these movies i just reckon they lack the spontaneity of this one and feel too regulated will ever achieve what is it it's the feeling that the film makers were experimenting as they shot and edited not afraid to leave in some blemishes so as to learn lessons for the next time for me this makes watching movies all the more fun and dangerous,1
i was curious to know how critics responded to this rousing inspiring film so i went to rotten tomatoes and was dismayed to discover that the pompous peanut gallery that is our nation's film critics had given the film an average 43 or rotten rating br br all i can say is if this movie doesn't move you you have no heart it's interesting to note that the same film on the same website got a 74 rating from viewers br br not that the opinion of critics is all that important to me after all i can't think of a more useless overpaid profession some schmo gets paid to go to the movies what a tough life and does the same thing everyone else on the planet does forms an opinion but these chumps have a way of coming across like their opinion somehow matters more than yours and even worse they love to hate br br i'll grant you that this movie is old fashioned well except for the f bombs syrupy and a little predictable after all you know right from the beginning that cuba gooding jr portraying real life navy hero carl brashear is going to triumph eventually at every turn simply by the way he comes across determined and plucky strong willed and optimistic br br but his performance and that of de niro as billy sunday a composite character of several real life people are so strong so inspiring that you'll be on your feet cheering many of the film's scenes especially the courtroom climax you'd have to be a real stick in the mud not to be moved by these scenes like our nation's film critics michael rappaport is excellent as well as a sweet natured stuttering diving student that befriends gooding's brashear if anyone has seen higher learning this character totally redeems that character br br anyway this confirms what i've always felt don't listen to critics see this movie and get inspired,1
i always have a bit of distrust before watching the british period films because i usually find on them insipid and boring screenplays such as the ones of for example vanity fair or the other boleyn girl but with a magnificent production design european landscapes and those thick british accents which make the movies to suggest artistic value which they do not really have fortunately the excellent film the young victoria does not fall on that situation and it deserves an enthusiastic recommendation because of its fascinating story the excellent performances from emily blunt paul bettany and jim broadbent and the costumes and locations which unexpectedly make the movie pretty rich to the view and i say unexpectedly because i usually do not pay too much attention to those details br br victorian era was in my humble opinion one of the key points in contemporary civilization and not only on the social aspect but also in the scientific artistic and cultural ones but i honestly did not know about the origins from that era very much and maybe because of that i enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events which prepared the landing of modern era so much i also liked the way in which queen victoria is portrayed which is as a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good but they were at least inspired by good intentions i also found the depiction of the romance between victoria and prince albert very interesting because it is equally interested in the combination of intellects as well as in the emotions it evokes the only fail i found on this movie is that screenwriter julian fellowes used some clichés of the romantic cinema on the love story something which feels a bit out of place on his screenplay br br i liked the young victoria very much and i really took a very nice surprise with it i hope more period films follow the example of this movie the costumes and the landscapes should work as the support of an interesting story and not as the replacement of it,1
the only reason i didn't score this a one is that sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film it is a technically adept film br br that having been said this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program rather than actual fact and sibrel's irrefutable proof that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics br br i do not recommend watching this but if you do see it at google video for free don't let bart sibrel profit from your curiosity,0
there is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with praise let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by reese witherspoon that her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed robert mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work every frame of the man in the moon is evidence of film making at its best,1
having enjoyed joyce's complex novel so keenly i was prepared to be disappointed by joseph strick's and fred haines's screenplay given the fabulous complexity of the original text however the film turned out to be very well done and a fine translation of the tone naturalism and levity of the book br br it certainly helps to have read the original text before viewing the film i imagine the latter would seem disjointed with very odd episodes apparently randomly stitched together without a prior reading of the text to help grasp the plot br br it's amazing to see how filthy the film is given that it was shot in dublin in 1967 the irish film censors only finally unbanned it for viewing by general audiences in ireland as late as 2000 it was shown to restricted audiences in a private cinema club the irish film theatre in the late 1970s joyce's eroticism is not simply naturalistic and raunchy it offers many wildly perverse episodes never mind that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 they were still utterly taboo when the film was made in 1967 br br it is astonishing and heartening to watch the cream of the irish acting profession of the 1960s respected players all daring to utter and enact joyce's hugely transgressive text with such gusto br br bravo,1
simon's best comedy is superbly crafted by director gene saks and given life by the immense talents of lemmon and matthau no one delivers these lines better no one times them better nobody does it better,1
what a load of leftist hollywood bilge this movie glorifies mutiny as brave and noble if it be for pacifist principles the fairytale ends with the pacifist character played by danzel washington actually getting promoted for his treason what is it with these hollywood tools is this still payback for mccarthyism br br if i sound cynical it's because i am fed up with movies hawking a political agenda the military brass in this movie are portrayed as what else gung ho war mongers sound familiar ever see a movie where the cia or any government agency is not evil think about it yet again crimson tide stresses the point the hackman character u boat captain ramsey comes across like a raving lunatic until the very end when of course he comes to his senses does a complete 360 renounces his blood lust suggests a promotion for the treasonous ron hunter and repents by retiring from the service a guy mutinies takes command of your boat puts the u s at grave risk of receiving a nuclear first strike and you promote him what hogwash,0
the japanese run lola run his is one offbeat movie which will put a smile on just about anyone's face fans of run lola run tampopo go and slacker will probably like this one it does tend to follow a formula that is increasingly popular these days of separate seemingly unrelated vignettes all contributing the the overall story in unexpected ways catch it if you see it otherwise wait for the rental,1
this was the best muppet movie i've seen ever i happen to know that miss piggy's fantasy of meeting as infants was the cause of muppet babies the songs will remain in my head forever only saying so because that stupid nickelodeon show hey dude song still remains in my head sorry a little off the topic there but anyway what i like is animal after the credits saying bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye hasta luego that made me laugh so hard my absolute favorite is the play at the end i was surprised that the sesame street characters popped in at the wedding i'm just glad this movie was very entertaining i borrowed it from the library and now i have bought it because i can't keep the library's copy forever in conclusion i proclaim this is the best movie i've ever seen in my case it's even better than austin powers in goldmember which was my favorite movie,1
i loved the movie but like everyone said there were some bits that weren't developed enough i thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison sure they were supposed to be innocent american girls but still i felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have for example in the montage where they're sight seeing the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward looking br br then there are some parts that were very ambiguous i think it's pretty much understood that danes' character didn't do it but i can see how that could be confusing also why did the camera dwell on manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk i thought it was suggesting something but it turned out to be nothing br br apart from that the movie was great i cried when claire danes took the blame she's a great actress br br also i wanted to see that bitchy thai inmate get her ass kicked talk about lack of closure,1
i live in salt lake city and i'm not a mormon so why did i rent this movie well because i live in utah and thought it'd be nice to see locations i know in a film i really knew going into it that i wasn't going to get the inside jokes so i wasn't surprised when i sat with the deer in the headlights stare what i was surprised at was the ant non mormon actions that were placed in this film br br i know it's a mormon film catered to the members of the lds church but i found it offensive because of the typical stereotype of people that isn't of their faith every non mormon which wasn't many drank smoked and had an amazing selfishness attitude why br br that really ticked me off about this film they made the mormons so pure yet the rest of the state of utah i guess is filled with punk psychos just because they don't follow the scriptures of the lds church br br i can understand having the plots revolve around all lds members but you'd think salt lake city was 100 mormon which isn't even close to being the truth and as i said the non mormons in the movie were portrayed as drunken jerks please br br i guess i just don't get it because i don't belong to their faith and i guess i never will,0
i understand this film to be a debut feature and as such it is very impressive it has the feel and pacing of a true indie yet director todd yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional the shots are well framed and thought out and serve to move the story forward he and screenwriter ivan solomon deliver a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical paint by numbers type scripts it's a story that needs judd hirsch caliber character talent to have a shot at working judd is fantastic as usual as are scott cohen and the beautiful susan floyd the real surprise though is elliot korte who plays adam groden yellin was able to coax nuance out of the young actor in a role that could have been easily devalued by stereotype or overreach anyway i found the film refreshing and entertaining,1
in 1943 a group of raf officers including eric wiiliams decide to escape from a pow camp using a gymnastic vaulting horse in the courtyard in 1950 it was decided to film his account and it kick started a peculiar british film genre the military prison camp story that reached its apogee in danger within 1959 br br the wooden horse is one of the quietest films i have ever watched there are no great dramatic moments but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesn't give way for unlikely drama jump cuts or jacked up somethings about to happen music it is utterly of its time and works beautifully br br leo glenn anthony steel and david tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and i suspect non actors without exception all are constantly mono tonal and quiet they keep emotion out of their roles as so many were until recently ex service i suspect they recreated their war time roles as 'officers and gentlemen' br br this unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension on the contrary unlike most wartime escape films the story doesn't end at the barbed wire and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end,1
this utterly dull senseless pointless spiritless and dumb movie isn't the final proof that the world can forget about danny boyle and his post trainspotting movies the beach already took care of that what this low budget oddity does is merely to secure his place among those who started very well but got completely lost in drugs booze ego self delusion bad management or whatever it was that lead to this once promising director's quick demise br br the premise is absurd two losers ecclestone and some bimbo jenna g a rapper likely meet by chance and spontaneously start singing with fervour more akin to lunatic asylum inhabitants than a potential hit making duo which they become a friend of theirs an even bigger illiterate loser becomes their manager by smashing a store window and stealing a video camera by which he films them in action and then shows the tape to some music people who actually show interest in this garbage now i know that the uk in recent years has put out incredible junk but this is ridiculous the music makes oasis seem like the beatles during the studio recordings the duo strumpet change lyrics in every take and ecclestone quite arrogantly tells the music biz guys to take it or leave it and quite absurdly they do take it not only is the music total and utter trash but its performers are anti social these newcomers are supposed to be calling the shots it's just too dumb it's plain awful br br the dialog is unfunny and goes nowhere and this rags to bitches story has no point and makes no sense it often feels improvised under the influence of drugs danny boyle is a complete idiot this little piece of trash is so bad it's embarrassing to watch ecclestone's i q also has to be questioned for agreeing to be part of this nonsense whoever financed this £1000 joke should leave the movie business before they end up selling their own underwear on street corners,0
i found the storyline in this movie to be very interesting best of all it left out the usual sex and violence they're getting old inserted in many movies the movie was well done in its flashbacks to days gone by in that area of the southwest the acting was also superb,1
i really enjoyed the reunion a lot i would have rated it a 10 if they had had hassie and little luke there wasn't even a mention of where they are today or why they didn't participate in the reunion they were very popular characters and i think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearance br br anyway i was glad that tnn ran the series again i had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series i may have missed a few episodes jenny hanahan,1
kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness the plot is so contrived and unbelievable starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people including clergy involved in what is a crime everywhere next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces a very unpleasant and coo coo mother aided abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends moving the setting from an island off the coast of south carolina did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget the very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service kim basinger whom i do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads i thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all the movie i kept surfing back and forth to had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much unless you like an unbelievable story wooden acting a contorted mixture of religious mythological allegory my advice is to skip this one oh and maybe a small carping criticism but wouldn't a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat the best part of this movie is the scenery,0
although george c scott is the only actor in this version of acc without a british accent he more than makes up for it with his over the top and larger than life interpretation of ebenezer scrooge br br particularly effective is when he confronts bob cratchit in his office at the movie's end as scott stands before a large window sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him all you can see is his silhouette augmented by scott's voice a ponderous growl the effect is galvanizing much like marlon brando's first scene in apocalypse now the horror indeed br br however as they say the very thing that works for you can also work against you because scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie it proves infectious to put it another way the before scrooge is almost as charismatic as the after even though he really shouldn't be it's what you might call the doctor smith effect since jonathan harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies stage and screen alike br br actually i myself don't consider scott's glib rage a liability but other christmas carol purists might see the film and judge for yourselves,1
a compelling honest daring and unforgettable psychological horror film that touches on the painful experiences of pain caused by rape descent is a film that went under the radar due to its lack of distribution because frankly the film is so brutal in its depictions that if it had been released theatrically it may have met itself to some strong biased hate br br the film deserves to be discovered for not only its dark themes and not only for its amazing direction and authentic style but most of all for its performances chad faust is absolutely stunning bringing enough sickness and enough vulnerability to make one not relate to but understand this fractured man with a twisted perspective on his sexuality with not only the women he rapes but also the fragile insecurities deep within his own self it's a supporting performance that is so complex brave and emotional on faust's part and hard to forget br br however the standout is rosario dawson whose performance here is an absolute revelation a tour de force of realistic dramatic tics and one of the most subtle yet loud as can be performances in quite some time while dawson is seen in some good supporting performances in some great to bad films she proves here she has what it takes to deliver some emotionally sweeping and moving performances believably and thematically br br one of the best films of its year and 2007 was a strong one had this underrated and intelligent film hit theatrical release i would be screaming praises for it as well as dawson and faust too bad it was way too blunt for a widespread appeal films like this deserve better,1
this movie could have been so much better especially considering the talent larenz tate's portrayal of frankie lymon was not good especially in musical performances he doesn't lip sync well and his stage mannerisms are larenz tate when he should have been frankie lymon the portrayal of the women as a bunch of gold diggers has hollywood written all over it the powers that be obviously pushed it but it only made the characters more unrealistic the positives of the movie were miguel nunez's portrayal of little richard and the cameo of little richard himself lela rochon is eye candy as usual even in a conservative role it's too bad that the talents of halle berry and vivica a fox were wasted the whole frankie lymon saga was fascinating in real life too bad this film was a wasted opportunity,0
my only minor quibble with the film i grew up knowing as stairway to heaven is the fact that the wonderful raymond massey is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene and the trial itself imo is the least interesting portion of this fascinating fantasy br br david niven and kim hunter are wonderfully cast as the young lovers but it's roger livesey who gives the liveliest and most credible performance french accented marius goring is a delight he even gets in a remark about technicolor as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight goring has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with relish br br seeing this tonight on tcm for the first time in twenty or so years i think it's a supreme example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for films the technicolor photography somewhat subdued and not garish at all is excellent and the way it shifts into b w for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and effectiveness br br the opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story and niven's tense talk with radio operator hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter truly a marvelous film from beginning to end another triumph for michael powell and emeric pressburger,1
what can i say this movie was so dumb stupid i thought it was a psychotic drag comedy they should rename it bitching pregnant cat fight what a stupid waste of time if you want to see die die i want your baby drag queen jennifer tilly being her freaky self then just rent out one of the chucky movie oh ya the bride of chucky it's more fun watching the two ugly plastic dolls one of them jennifer tilly turned into the ugly female version of chucky having squeaky plastic rubber sex then watching daryl hannah being pregnant dumb stupid jennifer tilly grinding up her husbang in a food processor reminded me of my mother trying to do house work ok it's just bad,0
the quintessential road movie if your idea of a road movie involves three would be magicians with eastern european accents and claire forlani well one out of four ain't bad a no talent magician with an eye for showmanship max watches a very skilled pickpocket hugo plying his trade in new york after convincing hugo that he max is a mental and b desperately in need of a partner to make his dreams of being a stage magician come alive the not so dynamic duo enlist the managerial expertise of an inventor of illusions milo and the ah gentler attributes of a lovely waitress lydia the unlikely four pile into a van obtained by hugo you guess where it came from and head to vegas havoc ensues anyhow it's funny it's well written and the ending is surprisingly good a solid comedy with a warm heart and all the better that it was totally unexpected,1
i know that some films i mean european films that are very bad films are being regarded as great cinema by certain critics only because they're non american i saw the 8 1 imdb score for this film and noticed the fact that this was being selected for certain big festivals don't let this fool you unless you're one of those people that likes mind numbing films like this and call it great art afterwards skip it the film contains one hilarious scene after another a similar italian film popped into my mind the terrible preferisco il rumore del mare i prefer the sound of the sea the problem with these films is that they're not only boring like some other strangely praised films but that they almost play like camp i mean let's face it the acting is horrible i mean soap opera level the story has not one surprise this has been done endless times before connecting several storylines short cuts magnolia playing by heart only much better not one realistic character in it some true freak seeing along the way notice the hilarious zombie like daughter and so on and so on br br as if that's not enough the film is 135 min count it long and at the end the director opens his can of sentimentality after a film with such hilariously bad dialogue and scenes that made the public at the preview screening laugh at so much incompetence well this is an insult to cinema and only receives high ratings because it happens to be in another language in this case spanish strange world we live in 3 10,0
i just don't understand why this movie is getting beat up in here jeez it is mindless it isn't polished and it is as i am reading wasted on some the cast of this movie plays their characters to the 't' if you watched permanent midnight and became a ben stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed these are misunderstood well intentioned misfits trying to save the city world with nothing but grit and determination the problem is they don't realize their limits until the big showdown and that's the point this is 3 times the movie that the spy who shagged me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group likely the same people who feel the first ap movie pales in comparison to the sequel i just don't get it the jokes work on more then one level if you didn't get it i know what level you're at,1
i was attracted to seeing this movie because of this plot and my desire to watch a horror br br to my disappointment this turned into more of a comedy than a horror the acting dialog and flow of the movie was all very poorly done much of it didn't make sense for example there's a party of about 30 people and they're all terrified of one person despite them being at a secret location and are all healthy looking young adults and the guy threatening them sounds haggard i kept thinking maybe this was a parody of another movie like scary movie but they were trying too hard to make it look gruesome emphasis on try br br the blood and gore are also poorly done i've seen halloween costumes look more believable than this a guy with his head cut clean off looked clean missing signs bone flesh blood and even the head a strong downward strike with an ax on a corpse should lodge itself into something seemed like the guy was swinging a bat instead of an ax br br revealing who the main villain was supposed to be a twist but contradicted other parts in the story what was going in the guy's mind to turn out like that if there was going to be a twist you should at least build up to it adding mystery and suspense,0
this is one of the best bond games i have ever played because br br the missions are very very fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be really hard sometimes that makes it even more fun the weapons that you use are really good the cars in this game are really good the driving missions are fun to do this james bond game has a good story to it the voice over actors in this game are really good and it is cool that pierce brosnan is in this game and the way the characters look is really good because they look like what they look like in real life which is really cool also the graphics in this game pretty good br br overall score out of,1
in a college dorm a guy is killed by somebody with a scythe his girlfriend beth dorie barton discovers him and tries to commit suicide she's institutionalized a year later she's out has a new boyfriend named hank joseph lawrence and is about to spend spring break with hank and four other mindless friends in a big beautiful condo in florida naturally the killer pops up for no reason and starts killing again br br lousy slasher thriller a textbook example of how not to do a low budget horror movie for starters large portions of this film are endless filler of these six idiots videotaping themselves having fun more fun than the audience getting drunk acting stupid etc etc also there is no nudity in here at all i'm not saying a horror film needs nudity but anything to liven this up would have helped none of the deaths are really shown you hear them are only a little bloody and there is no gore there's one real gruesome one but that's not till the end br br with a few exceptions the acting sucks dorie barton is dreadful as the main woman and tom jay jones is lousy as oz chad allen pops up as brad and he's terrible lawrence is actually very good handsome and hunky and giving this crap his all and jeff conaway pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job br br logic lapses abound after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex baston's non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and what happens to lawrence his character disappears without a trace at the end dull stupid no gore no nudity skip this one br br rated r for graphic violence and some profanity,0
i thought this was one of those really great films to see with a bunch of close friends i laughed and cried and laughed and cried at the same time it was just really touching although not a new concept this was a very well made film,1
i always look forward to this movie when its on tv have to get the dvd i guess the range of different types of people is great it says to me that anyone can be a dancer if they try hard enough my favorite character must be mr aoki he is so quirky but so full of emotions it is a perfect movie with wonderful dancing unfortunately we never get the chance to see them go to blackpool would make for the perfect sequel if they had but i guess it leaves it to your imagination to what could of happened br br a very simple and innocent story he stays loyal to his wife and daughter br br i haven't seen the hollywood remake not sure if i want to i don't really enjoy jennifer lopez i think richard gere more matches the original than lopez i have a feeling that the remake is not as simple and innocent,1
just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water br br another computer generated mutant croc on the prowl for human lunchmeat let loose by another one of those facilities conducting mad science gereco biotech company is fooling around with growth hormone research accidentally releasing a baby crocodile which is evolving at an accelerating rate br br b movie cast add a deal of fun to this run of the mill genetic mistake monster movie costas mandylor evokes mick dundee aussie accent hat big ass knife the works as a croc specialist hired by gereco executive joanna pacula wasted in the stereotypical role of corrupt administrative executive who denies any involvement with the gigantic beast her facility let free on innocent people charles napier is the local sheriff whose town is in danger and jane longenecker is his hot daughter who works at the animal shelter soap opera star matthew borlenghi is longenecker's love interest a local artist who welds sculptures his brother is a victim of the croc of course this skill will come in mighty handy when our heroes set up a created trap for the croc hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide br br the croc itself is never the least bit convincing as it rampages through a reserve looking for food the special effects of a low grade variety in regards to roger corman productions dealing with renegade dino monsters i stick with carnosaur the monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on it's hind legs often upright as it pursues potential victims i felt mandylor and the filmmakers were spoofing crocodile dundee with his croc hunter and this imitation might amuse where the monster itself fails borlenghi and longenecker actually have pretty good chemistry together on screen as expected pacula gets her commuppance in hilarious fashion gulp,0
an excellent depiction of one of the more unwholesome aspects of that era i loved the visuals very fitting for a story connected to a graphic novel br br i thought tom hanks was really great in this he came across very well as someone who has been hardened by his work which he didn't fully choose for himself but still wants to have a normal life for his family he does the best he can to see that happen don't want to spoil the plot but you have to see this movie if you are a person who wants more from a movie than the usual shoot 'em up action gangster format it is violent though,1
i'm too old to know or care exactly what the difference between rap and hip hop is and being canadian it's likely that i've never actually seen mtv but i'm not certain br br but i thought this film was very funny when i saw it a bright little satire hip hop culture is so pervasive these days that it's difficult not to keep hearing about it over and over if only we could say the same about bagpipe music i got most of the jokes at least i think i did sure it's derived from spinal tap but there are lots of targets that could stand a tap treatment just not the carpenters they're sacred,1
i watched this show and i simply didn't find it funny at all it might have been the first episode lately i realize abc is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station all the characters on this show are pretty bad actors but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down i would say that i believe this show will be cancelled but seeing as how abc is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing they might just keep this one simply because it's average compared to them,0
i'll give writer director william gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill conceived thriller a good argument for not wasting money subscribing to hbo let alone buying dvds based on cover art and blurbs a pedestrian dennis hopper and a game richard grieco add nothing significant to their resumes although the art direction is not half bad the dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit this is storytelling at its worst no tension no suspense no dread no fear no empathy no catharsis no nothing a few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer i feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing good for late night zoned out viewing only you have been warned,0
this tv movie goes to show that bad films do exist the only reason i saw this was it was covered on a ktma mst3k it's super bowl at the superdome in new orleans however no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing with the many stars in this film it made no difference i really don't know why i watched this,0
i absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film the humor seems to be destined for corpses it's slow the story is too simple to be true the characters do not raise much sympathy a few non important characters aside nothing surprising happens what did the writers of this script think oooo funny let's make some old lady's high on pot let's make them giggle let's make them behave like little children oooo yes that's absolutely brilliant and original br br this film has irritated me most from all the films i've seen in the last five years,0
i resisted seeing this movie and i understand why it was not a big hit in theatres october sky feels and looks oh so familiar and it is all plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films and possibly even better but despite it's familiarity and resistance to all formulas hollywood this movie is winning and likeable at every turn br br sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart mind and soul just as the characters from steven sondheim's musical merrily we roll along stood agape atop their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation what do you call it you call it a miracle sputnik has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale while jaded townsfolk of their 1950's coal town dismiss the event homer hickham sees sputnik as his ticket out of a life in the mines br br masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy homer and his pals seem fresh and new especially affecting are subplots concerning homer's ailing young school teacher remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship also remarkable is the father son supblot that anchors the film perfectly played all around even homer's mom gets her moment without cliche or intrusion her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heatbreaking myrtle beach says it all br br a major video chain i despise has a sign next to this film stating that you'll love this film or they'll refund your money for once i agree with them you'll never look at the october sky quite the same again br br,1
some people have stated that as of the 11th season south park has started a trend of leaving behind their politically biting satire for shallow spoofs but this could not be further from the truth br br while this episode does spoof the living dead series there is more it is a satire of how people treat the homeless characters say things like they're pretending to be just like us or they want to be human this episode attacks a culture of people who ignore the lower class who are often just down on their luck br br so yes it is still a satire and also a wonderful spoof what more could you want,1
this entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment its the best ending of any movie i've ever seen perfect beautiful funny simply wonderful br br i found this movie delightful even with it's french taking itself too seriously deep meanings thing going on i loved it it's a great love story and i loved the way algerians were woven in and by the way the music during the final credits is great i want the cd,1
actually i'm surprised there were so many comments about this movie i saw it as part of a slavic film festival at a major american university but nobody in usa has heard of it which is a real shame the dynamics between the people are what makes it both funny and sad they are stuck together on a long bus trip someplace most of us have been but i never had one like this br br my favorite scene is the one where they stop for the funeral then the man woman sneak off for some lovemaking in the forest but everybody follows them to watch without them knowing just as she raises her skirt and he enters her all the way the consumptive starts hacking they realize everybody is watching talk about surprised but you really have to feel for them even if it is hilariously funny when you see the ending it is sort of ironic that they enjoyed themselves while they did serb humor at it's best,1
this film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it what really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny the actress replacing jean reno's descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it's a waste of perfectly good film the torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions this second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well this film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a 'necklace' no script since it was apparently written and added to daily no attention to camera or shots in mind poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so this film would not even pass for a student film in basic film 101 how this pile got through no one can tell it was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries this movie has one good part its end this film is my 1 worst film of all time finally howard the duck is no longer the goose,0
superhero movies pretty much always suck and this is no exception its only redeeming quality is the fact the movie could have been even worse i would put 'batman robin' and 'steel' above this movie so yes it is that bad br br if your looking for a black superhero check out 'blankman' its not a serious superhero movie but at least its entertaining,0
this is widely viewed in australia as one of the best cop dramas ever produced here and for my money anywhere it's raw gritty the characters are real the situations are believable and it doesn't shy away from the darker side of life confronted every day by cops and the criminals victims lawyers and other people in their various orbits br br this show ran for 2 seasons and was discontinued because the show didn't sell well overseas we are all sorry for its loss however like fawlty towers we will be able to revere this as a limited length series of uniformly high quality,1
peter bogdonavich has made a handful of truly great films and they all laughed is one of his best the cast couldn't be better equipped to play this light but slightly bittersweet screwball comedy interestingly enough the witty light touch bogdonavich so effortlessly employs gives the film a rather disarming emotional core fresh and immediate the film starts with absolutely no explanation there's no soundtrack music to cue us we meet the characters in action and as bogdonavich glides down the streets of new york the film unfolds effortlessly robby muller's camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental but surely isn't the cast is terrific in every way a classic,1
i know i'm in the minority but br br uwe boll is about as talented as a frog not even a toad just a frog he's reminiscent of about a hundred other no talent hacks who churn out one useless crap fest after another br br this movie is a crap fest slater's talent is only minimally utilized leading one to believe he's got other things like his failed relationship on his mind reid performs as if she has either forgotten her acting lessons been severely hit on the head and made to forget her acting lessons or has one of the worst directors in the history of film i'm voting on the third choice myself although the other two are always possible br br uwe boll has never done a single thing from which i've derived even the slightest pleasure frankly i'm satisfied that he made this stinker i was concerned with bloodrayne competing with underworld evolution for ticket sales now i'm confident that len wiseman has nothing and i mean nothing to worry about br br this rates a 1 0 10 rating for this messy convoluted crap fest from br br the fiend,0
okay this movie f ck in' rules it is without question one of the most technically inept pieces of cinema ever made absolutely terrible but you gotta see it rent this with your buddies and come up with a drinking game or just have fun it's hilarious and the behind the scenes featurette proves it you can do anything with paper plates and finger paint awesome okay rent it just for this one scene two characters are actually walking in place for about 3 minutes in a shot the director on the commentary says yeah the tracking was so smooth it looks like they're yeah right man they are totally walking in place it's so funny,0
it looks to me as if the creators of the class of nuke 'em high wanted it to become a cult film but it ends up as any old high school b movie only tackier the satire feels totally overshadowed by the extremely steretyped characters it's very un funny even for a turkey,0
the movie is a bit thin after reading the book but it's still one of the greatest movies ever made sheryl lee is beautiful and nick nolte is really vonneguty he makes great job expressing the feelings from the book to the film not many films engage the feeling of the book as well as mother night does,1
this film is another example of the curse of east asian cinema two or more separate stories rolled into one film other reviewers have obviously picked up on it as well because there are several mentions of the first part and second part how can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and the story are featured for such a short time i was enjoying the first part until it abruptly stopped it didn't end it just stopped in what appeared to be the middle of the story to be replaced by an inane and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around a girl rearranging and cleaning a guy's apartment wow i look forward to the day when wong kar wai is given a decent script to work with,0
whew what can be said about gymkata that hasn't already this is nothing but pure halarity from beginning to end if you want a movie that will keep you on the floor laughing this is the perfect movie to get from cabot's wild style mullet sweater combo to parmistan and it's four billion assorted ninjas everything about this film reeks of crap br br directed by robert clouse the infamous mind that brought you the mirror scene in bruce lee's game of death he once again showcases his complete lack of directing talent a few other faces you most likely won't recognize will appear for your enjoyment as well from buck kartalian to tadashi yamashita although you won't remember them or care about them after the movie is done br br supposedly based on a book called the terrible game which if i could find a single trace of it's existence anywhere i would be interested in reading it to see where this thing went wrong instead the book apparently is a figment of gymkata's imagination probably something clouse made up in order to sell his lame idea br br pick this one up and yakmallah it for yourself it is easily one of the best bad movies i have ever seen and that is saying quite a bit,0
going berserk is actually one of the funniest candy films i have ever seen period sure it's kinda low budget but it's a non stop comedic tour de force there are tons of memorable quotes for instance when his soon to be father in law asks him how much he earns candy says oh i pull down anywhere between thirty and eleven thousand dollars a year sir oh course it is candy's delivery that sells it just classic stuff eugene levy also turns in a hilarious performance as a sleazy filmmaker a clip of his horrible low budget movie kung fu u will have you rolling br br so if you are a candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem i can't recommend this movie enough,1
i have seen this movie more than several times on tv i always watch it again never turning the channel this movie is full of chilling surprises and absolutely edge of your seat suspenseful without being overbearing or stupid helen hunt's talent is magnificently shown in this movie i recommend this movie to anyone,1
chalk this one up in the win column this was a superb movie the acting performances were great and the script was equally great br br helen hunt was magnificent as the riverside police officer gina pulasky gina was a complex character she was a rookie cop with the riverside police dept she ended up in an affair with a coworker that she knew had a wife and kids all the while she took on the dangerous task of going undercover to catch a serial killer br br jeff fahey the ray liotta look alike did a bang up job as the confused often stammering police officer that had an affair with gina he was stoic as an officer but he was quite the opposite when it came to dealing with his feelings and his extra marital affair br br steven weber most notably from the sitcom wings did a nice job as the quiet meek underachieving sociopath on the surface he was an innocent loser but beneath the surface lied a cold hearted killer weber really took on the persona of a childlike young adult with an insatiable thirst to kill young boys br br the entire movie was spectacular each scene each verbal exchange let us know more and more about the characters the production team did a phenomenal job with condensing days if not weeks worth of events into a 90 minute movie this movie was a good example of doing a lot with little,1
ok i'm not an american but in my humble scottish opinion steve martin is not never has been and never will be a funny man as long as our posteriors point in a southerly direction phil silvers as sergeant bilko was a funny man no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team working characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and dateless situation comedies america has ever produced how anyone could have the audacity to even attempt to replicate the phil silvers character is beyond me to compound things the exercise was repeated in martin's unfunny attempt to be peter seller's inspector clouseau another abortive attempt in my opinion to rekindle a demonstrably unfunny career some of your contributers say 'steve martin puts his own stamp on the character' to that i would say 'balderdash' his portrayals will be long forgotten when those of silvers and sellars will be treasured for generations to come,0
i couldn't not recommend a christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drivel trust me double negatives are required here it's that bad this film was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter the musical numbers are all far too long and none of them any good thank you very much has a decent melody but the lyrics are stupid beyond words i would gladly bear the chains worn by scrooge in the film's bizarre hell sequence than sit through this insult to movie musicals again br br the only entertaining part of this movie completely unintentional by the way involves alec guinness as jacob marley dressed in a silly powder white costume guinness foppishly prances through his scenes in what was either an attempt to make it appear as though he was floating like a ghost or to show his utter disdain with having to be in this dreadful movie albert finney meanwhile blends the best of alistar sim and charles laughton to create his hopelessly loathsome character of quasimodo scrooge finney's scrooge is so hideous a person it's impossible to believe his transformation br br steer clear of this abomination of filmmaking at all costs,0
i am not a big fan of horror films and have only seen a handful of them and none of the halloween s or friday the thirteenth s but i can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore and i'm pretty sure this isn't scary br br what's so spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere in all of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots so there's no real surprise in any of this film not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway but br br the plot concerns claus von bulow's third cousin john hudson who marries a donna reed look a like peggey webber giving one of the worst performances ever who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband's mansion did i mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident ooooh wonder who did it br br this is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and or drive their wife insane if you want to see a well done version of this stuff try reversal of fortune and btw jeremy irons is one hundred times more talented than john hudson br br the msting was okay but nothing special paired with the gumby short however it makes for good viewing br br two stars for the screaming skull eight stars for the mst3k version br br and now to paraphrase mr von bulow himself how bad is this film you have no idea,0
bah another tired desultory reworking of an out of copyright work never designed to be filmed br br on the plus side toni collette is superb as always being an actual actress you see and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between scenes there are even a few genuinely funny lines and the filmwork score and editing is competent apart from a bizarre lapse into voiceover and speaking to the camera towards the conclusion br br but ah but much of the cast seems to be on autopilot and they are almost all very clearly too old and in one case too young for their declared ages worse they are all speaking austinese that peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that couldn't be further from the way people actually spoke in austen's day think yosemite sam i kid you not this is particularly sad considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally farcial fakespearan that olivier and his cronies were so fond of bellowing at the top of their lungs br br and worst of all is gwyneth paltrow she's only ever played one character in her films and she stays true to form here running through her entire range smirking to sulking in the first ten minutes then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film there is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart br br in short there is very little reason to watch emma it's an amiable enough adaptation but if you're going to pack a film full of anacronisms i e an appalingly thin lead who can't shoot a bow or handle a period accent then you might as well do it properly as with the vastly superior clueless,0
ernst marischka one of the most respected austrian directors of that time made films full of beautiful scenes delicate love and with respect to all that is precious in life br br nowadays if people should hear about him they associate the name of marischka with sissi trilogy 1955 1956 1957 however he made other excellent films like das dreimaderlhaus 1958 embezzled heaven 1958 and definitely this one madchenjahre einer konigin showing the young years of queen victoria although it deals with a slightly different theme than sissi films i do not see many differences between this movie and sissi they are strikingly similar br br the movie is almost identical the style the music the photography in fact the crew are almost the same anton profes bruno mondi br br the cast romy schneider's one of the first main roles it was a lovely introduction to her role of sissi since this film was made one year before the first part of the trilogy about the austrian empress it is also a film where romy plays with her mother magda schneider but ernst marischka was not the first director who cast romy to play with her mum romy's debut wenn der weisse flieder wieder bluhn 1953 was her performance with her mother too therefore there were some voices that romy began her austrian career on the bases of her mother's fame indeed there is some truth in it br br again like in sissi this film shows love very gently victoria meets prince albert in a little inn in dover their sympathy is based on pure exaltation in dance and gentle smiles and now what would it be showed like only sex but is it the only thing love is based on br br i am grateful to ernst marischka for these movies they had a soul and a message some people may call them kitschy but i will never give up admiring these films they are impressive unfortunately highly underrated,1
oh man it is amazing how somebody can claim global warming to be a science well i guess this elitist nonsense is now replacing the science of eugenics al gore tries to make this issue sound complicated even though it just needs common sense to see this whole thing is a big hoax by a man with his own moneymaking agenda br br how have scientists estimated historical temperatures of this planet by estimating the sun spot activity has nobody ever questioned if this method has been accurate no not even gore himself so how the heck would it not be accurate to forecast future temperature with sun spot activity if it has been that accurate in the past according to sun spot activity the temperature today is totally in line with what it should be how come the temperature in the entire universe has risen relatively equal much as on earth does our suvs cause temperature on jupiter to rise br br use some common sense you do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this can be nothing else than a hoax please research it yourself what does al gore and his elitist friends like rothschild banking family that arranged live earth event to gain from this well the new world bank will be founded on carbon credits that is tax on everything that gives co2 omissions and it is easier to get away with these taxes if the people are lured to think it is to save the world when it is only about money centralized control and more power to the elitist bankers al gore has even a company that sells carbon credits is it not noble to pay voluntarily carbon credits to save the world especially if it goes into his own company br br i do not want you to blindly believe me please do your own research and use your own common sense and i am sure you will come to the right conclusion,0
this film was really eye opening i have seen this film several times first when i was four and i actually remembered it and then when i was 12 the whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving god out of our everyday lives or just plain going the extra mile to insult him br br a great movie for non believers and believers alike,1
i saw this recent woody allen film because i'm a fan of his work and i make it a point to try to see everything he does though the reviews of this film led me to expect a disappointing effort they were right this is a confused movie that can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy a romantic fantasy or a drama about female mid life crisis it fails at all three br br alice mia farrow is a restless middle aged woman who has married into great wealth and leads a life of aimless luxury with her rather boring husband and their two small children this rather mundane plot concept is livened up with such implausibilities as an old chinese folk healer who makes her invisible with some magic herbs and the ghost of a former lover with whom she flies over manhattan if these additions sound too fantastic for you how about something more prosaic like an affair with a saxophone player br br i was never quite sure of what this mixed up muddle was trying to say there are only a handful of truly funny moments in the film and the endingis a really preposterous touch of pollyanna br br rent 'crimes and misdemeanors' instead a superbly well done film that suceeds in combining comedy with a serious consideration of ethics and morals or go back to annie hall or manhattan,0
i wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine it wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic the storyline is different and i am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands directing and acting were awful i had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs although the movie started promisingly it got worse and worse i think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters i still think that it is worth watching as i haven't seen films subjecting gay porn don't keep your expectations high though then you will be very disappointed out of,0
this is a really old fashion charming movie the locations are great and the situation is one of those old time preston sturgess movies fi you want to watch a movie that doesn't demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it the acting is good and i really liked michael rispoli he was in rounders too and while you were sleeping the rest of the cast is fun it's just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings i know sounds kooky but it is and that's what makes it fun to watch it will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you but at least you'll know,1
did anyone edit this film or was it only the dvd release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes it's ok though i fell asleep watching it the first time then i fell asleep the second time and the third time the plot is actually not the worst i've seen but it's close the acting is not the worst i've seen either but it's close the production well i can honestly say that it was the worst i had ever seen in my life not trying to be spiteful but unhinged could have used some more production br br please don't think i'm a hater of horror films or even that i didn't enjoy this film i just felt i was laughing at the film much more than i felt i was laughing along with it the gruesome moments were not too poorly done but could have been done better even with a shoestring budget br br characters seemed awkwardly developed or ignored all together twist ending was pretty bad and the exposition took forever without exposing much br br i'd recommend avoiding this movie br br 1 10,0
very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win it john toturro plays a psychologically challenged man nothing matters to him accept 64 squares and 32 pieces the game validates him as a person when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and john torturro expresses this in a beautiful fashion even the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existence it makes you wonder if there other luzon's out there who obsess about the game i am sure they are if you are a chess enthusiast it won't hurt to watch it its an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed well it achieves its objectives unfortunately i doubt if there will be sequel,1
this period melodrama is one of griffith's earliest claustrophobic films characters trapped within a room are prevalent throughout his work and as time went by he would become increasingly adept at portraying their helplessness and involving the audience in their terror in the bluntly titled sealed room there is one major difference to the normal plot line in that there truly is no escape br br griffith achieves the claustrophobic effect here in two ways first is his use of space while the typical biograph short might utilise a dozen or more sets the sealed room features only two adjoining rooms  the king's court and the dove cote that becomes the eponymous tomb the set design in these shorts is rarely referenced but here it is crucial the court is a large interior with a backdrop hinting at greater depth and showing us a window and a staircase actors enter and leave from various directions suggesting the room is not only spacious but also free and open by contrast the dove cote's back wall is very close to the camera and the angles in it suggesting a hexagonal or octagonal shape make it seem even more confined br br the second technique on display here is the cross cutting anyone with an interest in griffith's work will probably know about his heavy use and development of cross cutting to build excitement or tension many will also know that strictly speaking it wasn't his invention however what makes griffith's cross cuts so effective is the way he paces the opposing images so they complement each other the sealed room contains a good example of what i mean the shots of the masons shifting the heavy bricks have a slow step by step pace to them with tension building as the wall gets higher this movement is matched by the shots of the blissfully unaware lovers in which marion leonard tears off flower petals one by one as the couple realise their predicament their rising panic is complemented by the opposing shot of the king madly thrashing his sword against the wall br br at this point griffith was yet to realise that the action could be heightened further by introducing a third strand to the cross cut the dramatic ride to the rescue here absent was later to become a standard climax to griffith's pictures,1
imagine turning the american national anthem into a cartoon throw in a couple of cute animals some terrible puns and a pair of roller skates and you'd find yourself with almost an exact replica of this film br br i remember seeing this when i was younger i made my mother rent it from the video shop about 5 times the story itself isn't too bad it's just that any marxists watching would certainly have something to complain about br br if you don't like america you won't like this film,0
in the early 1970s many of us who had embraced hippy acid alternative culture wholeheartedly had realised that mainstream society was not going to change in the way we thought it would for me this film defined the tension of now what that many of the people i knew felt at that time do we head for the commune and create our own vision of utopia or do we radicalize and push for change br br from the futile gestures to police the radical rhetoric the music of pink floyd to the love making and the explosive images in the desert so much is in there it captures well a significant moment in time,1
i am very open to foreign films and like to think that i grasp what they are trying to accomplish although some things are lost in translation but the simplicity and intelligence of this film were boring i've often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time period that really had no point now that i've seen a movie like that i will no longer be thinking along those lines there's tones about society racism and some desire but south park has that and when i watch south park it actually moves me to feel an emotion the closest thing i felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn i experienced after the first five minutes i rate the typical movie a seven or above because i love most every film i gave this film a one,0
yes there are great performances here unfortunately they happen in the context of a movie that doesn't seem to have a clue what it's doing during the first 45 60 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance suddenly about an hour in the characters who until this point had always spoken to each other suddenly start singing to each other to further confuse things a little further in out of nowhere they actually do about 15 minutes of sung through dialog then seem to drop that idea and move on to other things such as a number that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen string section on top of all this inconsistency in how the music is used is the composers' clear inability to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed while the first couple of pieces do sort of mimic the 1950s motown sound the rest of the film is just bad broadway show music then there's the pure silliness of snippets of a group doing a bad jackson family imitation and eddie murphy morphing from little richard to james brown to lionel richie when he started channeling stevie wonder i couldn't help laughing out loud this was clearly one of those films that make me appreciate how little time i have on earth and resent that i wasted two hours of it watching this film,0
having heard so many people raving about this film i thought i'd give it a go apart from being incredibly slow which i don't mind as long as the wait is worth it but it just isn't as many others have said there are so many inconsistencies and so much of this film just doesn't ring true the reaction of the 4 men switches from shock horror on finding the body to complete indifference whilst they fish surely if they were the type of men that would go on happily fishing then they would have just reported the body and said they had only discovered it after their fishing trip why on earth tie the body to a tree go fishing and then tell everyone you found the body 2 days previously its so hard to watch a film knowing that the behaviour of the main characters is so inconsistent as for the rest of the townsfolk well you'd think at least one of them might show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman the body itself naked except for the knickers what scenario leads to that if she was raped then why still the knickers if she was raped with the clothes on then why remove them afterwards bar the knickers if she wasn't raped then why take all her clothes off bar the knickers leaving yourself with evidence to dispose of i truly cant think of any realistic scenario that would lead to that other than killing someone to steal their clothes so you can fill up your jumble sale stall oh well its watchable but only just and only because despite the poor script the acting is strong,0

i have loved this movie since i first saw it in 1979 i'm still amazed at how accurately kurt russell portrays elvis right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face sometimes its scary how much he looks acts and talks like the real elvis thankfully this is being released on dvd so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film i have heard the detractors who say that there are some inaccuracies or some things left out but i think that keeping in mind that john carpenter only had about 2 1 2 hours to work with and that this was being shown on television just two years after elvis's death that he did a fine job with this in fact i haven't seen another elvis movie that even comes close to this one highly recommended,1
a group of friends come face to face with a family of hideous cannibals whilst camping in the beautiful german countryside br br the 'mutant cannibal family' concept is almost as old as the hills that the inbred freaks often call home so any director attempting to breath new life into the genre needs to come up with something pretty darn special in order to impress with barricade timo rose tries to give the well worn routine a teutonic twist by transplanting the action to the black forest and giving it the german low budget splatter treatment the result is a very bloody but totally unoriginal effort that is made almost unwatchable thanks to some dreadful directorial decisionsin particular the non stop use of fancy filters and irritating editing techniques br br had timo rose not opted to utilise every naff trick his editing software offered him then barricade might have been a reasonably entertaining gore fest his inexperienced cast do reasonably well the bloody effects are suitably stomach churning and there are one or two scares and even some well conceived creepy moments all of this however is completely ruined by the awful camera work choppy editing and overwhelming barrage of visual gimmickry used to give the film the distressed look that is so inexplicably popular with today's film makers br br i give barricade 3 out of 10 purely for the outlandish gore which includes a nifty scene where a guy is forced to drink acid loads of nasty wounds caused by a variety of sharp implements and some pretty decent shotgun damage,0
after reading tons of good reviews about this movie i decided to take it for a spin i bought it on dvd hence the spin pun i'm a dork the beginning was everything i hoped for a perfect set up along with some quotes that i've heard on various wu tang albums to what should have been a good movie but the plot i heard was so great was so predictable every time i saw a character except for the lizard i guessed which venom he was plus the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie ok so the plot wasn't very good but at least there was some good kung fu right wrong the fights were very short and few and far between granted the different styles were all pretty cool but i wish the fights were longer i kept hoping to see the lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened i was hoping to see the centipede do some tight speedy ish but it never happened i was hoping to see the scorpion in the movie for more than 7 total minutes but it never happened in short not much happens the fighting is all pretty routine don't be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot it does not mean it's a good one,1
i may have seen an episode or 2 when the show originally aired but when i watched 1 episode on netflix i was also hooked i watched the whole series in like 2 days i really liked gary cole's character first he's thoroughly reprehensible then you start liking the character these things have a thousand uses his folksy andy griffith meets charles manson meets satan is great charming charismatic smarmy and uh kind of dangerous and by kind of i mean really i wanna be like him when i grow up lucas black is great too the accents are great too anyway i thought this was one of the best tv shows ever and you owe it to yourself to see it,1
i have seen this wonderful production and i wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the blacksmith's wife i am not sure of her character's name i went to byu with her and lost touch with her her maiden name was kim luke and i wonder if anyone has any info on her she is not listed in the credits this production was outstanding a tear jerker on all accounts superb acting by all i guess i don't even want to put it in the general category of 'acting' more like 'portraying with feeling the amazing events that led to the opening of the heavens for this the final dispensation' something like that if anyone worked with kim or has a website or something please let me know she was fantastic in her role by the way thanks melissa thorne,1
who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i gordon's legendary bad trash film food of the gods nobody of course but director damien lee thought it was a good idea anyway and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history gnaw is a sequel in name only as the setting moved to a typical late 80's location a university campus and also the cheap cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the 80's this script hangs together by clichés awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other and more successful horror classics neil hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growing experiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus following the good old tradition that spielberg's jaws started there's an obnoxious dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere during a hysterically grotesque climax the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus' new sport complex gnaw food of the gods 2 is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch the characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff like descending into the sewers unarmed while they know it's infested with rats the acting is atrocious and there's a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growth serum i wonder what freud's theory would be on that there's a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and  it has to be said  the music is surprisingly atmospheric in case you just can't get enough of this junk there are quite a lot of creature features revolving on mutated rats like the italian schlock film rats night of terror the modest 70's cult film willard and its lame sequel ben the 2003 willard remake starring crispin glover and the surprisingly good recent rat movies by once famous directors tibor ticaks rats and john lafia the rats go nuts,0
there is so much that is wrong with this film but to sum it up terrible acting so bad it must have been on purpose poor script they may have had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story ridiculously bad ending in some cases the ending manages to save the film not in this case if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for this is the worst film i have seen in a long time it was complete torture sitting through this film i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance so do yourself a favor watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture,0
wow sheer brilliance br br turning a thriller suspense horror into comedy br br after watching this i never laughed so hard at a horror movie before a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that were just insanely developed either not written in depth or too much depth br br if you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog messed up plot useless scenes wasted characters bad sound and lousy development overall then this is the one to watch br br be sure to keep focused for the classic food processor scene and the totally inept police investigation scenes br br this is a remarkable new low in screen performance and writing and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either stupid daring or brave,0
the stories in this video are very entertaining and it definately is worth a look the first one concerns a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks with a great but unexplained twist at the end br br the seond is the best of the lot and it alone makes this worth watching a man is attacked by a dog which he fears to be rabid he finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital but he finds out the employees there are not exactly what they appear to be great twist at the end and this episode alone scores 10 10 if the others were up to par with this one this would get 10 10 br br the third is the weakest of the bunch a girl meets with some guys and has wild sex there appears to be no point to the story until the end with a good little twist but it is spoiled by the awful first part br br never the less this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all well worth a rental,1
this is one of the best films we watched in my high school spanish class if you are a fan of the opera this film will strongly entertain you of course the dancing is wonderful watching these amazing dancers moving to the music of bizet is well worth checking out,1
people like me will tear this movie apart it's just not realistic the plot is sooooooo predictable you can anticipate everything that happens convientantly of course they find the treasure and become filthy rich and trick the bad guy we've seen it a million times before the writers of this movie must think that the majority of the movie going public is stupid they must be right because the majority of people actually liked this film i mean solving riddles in a matter of seconds the secret treasure room hidden under the manhattan subway you'd think with all the work that's gone on in new york underground that room would have been discovered before and all that was constructed during the civil war please and the love story between ben and abigail how cute and i thought the romance in clive cussler novels was weak they just fall in love like that in 2 seconds whatever i'd be more concerned with saving my own ass then getting some the hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper 1 10 garbage,0
seriously this is one of the most stupid family shows of all time br br plot a family without a mother and 3 dads raise 3 little girls in san francisco california br br characters neat freak danny cartoon loving joey hair obsessed jesse spoiled brat michelle stupid dj and almost normal stephanie the creators of this show really want you to hate the characters don't they br br therefore i do not think anyone should watch this show i only chuckled at a few moments in the show's whole running and i think that instead of lethal injection all criminals should be forced to watch this show a torture far worse than anything else br br 1 5 10 or d,0
first off i dislike almost all neil simon movies but there is something about this that is unique that draws me in and i would say it is among the most entertaining comedies i have seen the second time i watched it the connection was clear when did neil simon meet my grandmothers br br ah afraid they might sue so he changed them into men and how dull would it be if they were only housewives show biz stars is more fun well this is a personal review and my still living grandmother at age 97 she even outlived walter matthau's magnificent impersonation of her would deny it but some of you must find resonance in these characters br br secondly i have little tolerance for george burns but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances i can recall and my late grandmother even enjoyed it although failing to recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film character br br very ethnic in flavor and over the top you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off for me the pleasure lingers,1
this is a very good spanish movie but i am worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the spanish civil war was all about or when it was fought being a history teacher i had a big advantage but could easily see how the film could be confusing until you piece together all the pieces i doubt if this would be a big concern in spain where this film was made but for other audiences they may be a bit confused until later in the film br br the movie begins with 12 year old carol and her mother returning to her mother's home town years have passed and you gather that they are coming to spain from new york city despite the strangeness carol speaks reasonably good spanish and much of the film is about how she adapts as for why her and her mother are alone i'll spill it now for those who don't pick up on the fact that carol's father is fighting in the war on the side of the republicans who eventually lost in this very bloody conflict br br the movie gets exceptional marks for its lovely camera work and music the rather slow and rambling pace isn't bad provided you are someone who can accept films this way i have seen several other spanish films about this war and this compares pretty well to them not better or worse just a decent slice of life film about those who are left behind as well as a nice coming of age flick br br ps if you don't know which side is which the republicans were mostly socialists and they were backed by the soviet union and mexico as well as volunteers from many countries including the usa the nationalists were led by franco and were aided by portugal and the fascist states of germany and italy,1
just because an event really happened doesn't mean that it will make a good screenplay movie the cat's meow by peter bogdanovich claims to be based on actual events which happened on a cruise hosted by william randolph hurst the writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit the key moments of the story seem implausible for example when hurst accidentally shoots the producer believing him to be chaplin basing a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is trite and contrived the story attempts to be a dark comedy but the cat's meow misses an important piece of this equation comedy there is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters it hardly matters who is shot who is killed who is guilty and who is innocent there is not a strong character to cheer for as a result the conflicts are difficult to care about and the eventual outcome is incidental,0
one of my favorite movies to date starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from atlanta the idea of living the chulawasse river before it's turned into a lake comes from burt reynold's lewis who unconsciously drowns his fellas into their worst nightmare but if the first half of the film appears rather like an action movie the second half carries the viewer into a totally different story with our men forced to make a decision that they know will change their lives forever in very bad ways at the end of the movie each person is gonna be forced to deal with the scars of what had just to be a quite week end on the river but muted into a fight for survival the movie except some pretty evident goofs is very well directed and beautifully shot into a paradise of nature that steals your breath the photography is excellent as well voight reynolds cox and beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tied to the same mistake,1
i sat through this movie this evening forcing myself to stick with it even though i never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them because the two leads gérard philippe and michèle morgan were major film stars of their era and i wanted to see them in something different which this certainly was they both gave fine performances but of distasteful characters br br indeed the whole movie is about a shabby little town in mexico inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful characters the doctor is of course the major exception what michèle morgan ever sees in philippe to fall in love with him is never explained br br this is supposedly based on a work by jean paul sartre all i could think was that if sartre's work is anything like this movie it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating camus' masterful novel the plague which dealt with a plague in north africa br br a well acted but uninteresting movie,0
from the very beginning the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed that the outcome is entirely predictable any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters incorporating character arcs and three act structure in this film you will find none of that the police are the baddies and consequently are shown as shallow incompetent and cowards it never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society br br the viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether ned kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain the film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence we see him walk through the door of a gaol but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue br br this film contains many shots of ned looking at the camera with a serious expression i found the film a real chore to watch it is the direction for modern films and this one put me off watching any more,0
much has been made of rohmer's use of digital technology to 'fill in' the background at times it works well the scene where grace and her maid witness from afar the king's execution is particularly striking at other times it gives the film a strangely amateurish look resembling a home video however the major failing is that the sheer artificiality of the mise en scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer we know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters to be frank i did not care at all what happened to the lady or the duke br br the other major failing i regret to say is the performance of lucy russell in the leading role she is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance ok she is speaking a foreign language but she is incapable of expressing real emotion her emoting in the scene where she recounts to her friend mme de meyler an excellent performance by the debutante helena dubiel seeing the head on a pole caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience also watch her hands when she is expressing emotion br br all in all a very disappointing film particularly given the positive reviews on this site,0
a longtime fan of bette midler i must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads a literal rainbow of emotion and talent bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire as well as new songs from the bette of roses album spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone the one and only divine diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around,1
this should not have been listed as a colombo because in my opinion it does not resemble any of the other colombo ever made this should have been listed as a movie starring peter falk and not playing the caracter of colombo because it does not do justice at all to our great lieutenant colombo,0
i loved the batman tv series and was really looking forward to this but they tried to do too much br br why they had the story of adam west and burt ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me i don't want to knock burt or adam for the way they look now it's been 35 years since they appeared at batman and robin but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting 'badguys' was kinda sad i would rather of just seen the ex stars do commentary the batmobile side story was stupid br br as for the flashback movie i think it was too short and left out way too much it was really just a quick overview in my opinion i'd like more background they showed the penguin and joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff i already knew the joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex smoker that was it on those 2 br br i'd love to read the book i am sure it has more in it that this showed like why was there 2 riddlers or why 3 catwoman's or 3 mister freezes where was commishioner gordon cheif ohara alfred mister freeze king tut etc the list goes on like i said even the ones that were in this one were barely in it br br very disappointing and really corny,0
what keeps us going or at least what i feel the writer wanted us to keep us glued at an early point is our desire to know whether martinaud has done the dirty deed without spoiling so much of course there is a red herring and a twist but then we discover that this is the story of martinaud's imperfections and his difficulty in coping when there is the revelation we begin to sympathize and pity him because as the story progresses we are made to think he is the sick perverted pedophiliac that we're predisposed to have in mind one of those things he has to cope with is the distant gap he and his wife have even though they live on the same roof these problems of course are given their denouement in the film's shocking finale br br this movie demands your patience and it has certainly tried those of restless teenagers sitting at the rear they were heckling obviously because they aren't partial to central location films although there is a bit of travelling when we get to the woods and the beach and we realize that gallien isn't as clever as we are made to think he is br br the inquisitor is 5 5,1
this is a very well made film meticulously directed and with some excellent character acting that at times is deeply moving for example the scene with the loyal but unsophisticated sidekick cop and his wife the plot is convincingly worked out and exciting the gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero it's made clear that the cops are just as rough and ready as the underworld characters br br a couple of slight reservations i found the ending slightly one sided as it celebrates the hero's successful integration into the structure of the police and justice system which collapses the ambiguity of the police characters which has been maintained up to that point also i found the lead female character somewhat weak little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero all she seems to do is weep and swoon as the tough guys battle it out,1
the dvd version consists of 2 episodes the parricide of caesar being the juncture in addition the language was spanish without subtitles hence it's hard for me to review in depth this movie because because i didn't understand what was said br br cleopatra being an historic icon the part is very difficult and i found that for a newcomer leonor varela just plays fine she is strong willed but also a very supportive tender soul mate thimothy dalton as caesar is perfect and their romance is the main thing of the first episode so it is not really a documentary nor a peplum but a great love story br br after the parricide a new lover comes marc antoine but the flavor is gone we remember always our first love so i found the second episode dull and their tragic fate isn't told powerfully br br nonetheless the production is luxurious the sets are big tastefully decorated the moroccan live location exotic and the wardrobes splendid the producers have a lot of money for sure but they spend nothing on the special effects they are so poor blue screens ships sphinx that it's funny br br finally i would like very much to hear it in french or english to make a definitive opinion about this two movies,0
the invisible mouse is a delightful and different tom jerry's cartoon it features the usual cat mouse chases and battles but in a different way this time jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of surprises for tom scare him torment him and confuse him br br as much as it is weird it's also very cool and funny to see what we can't see jerry invisible it's amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who's doing it we know who right it's like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts it's equally amusing to see jerry eating some candies and fruits while he's invisible i really like that instrumental music which plays when he's not visible br br some of the best jokes on this short are when tom sees jerry's shadow and slams him and even when tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and jerry writes missed me i also like when jerry drinks tom's chocolate milk becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face br br overall this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon humor entertainment fun and some nice artwork too,1

the acting other reviews notwithstanding was remarkably well done brad pitt handles the role of an annoying obnoxious austrian climber quite well other acting is fine the story could have been riveting but somehow it misses one never really understands or cares for the characters shown and so the story which could have been quite dramatic fails to draw in this audience br br beautiful scenery and cinematography a remarkably dramatic true story important events that shaped the world that we live in but i could not try as i might involve myself in this story as an unabashed brad pitt fan i consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation i expected to love this flick and yet it left me cold br br it could be a failing within myself but i tend to point toward the creative end of this movie direction scriptwriting production editing somehow they lost me it's a shame because it could have been wonderful br br good acting dramatic story beautifully shot it should have been magnificent it wasn't probably worth watching just to make your own mind up on it but don't expect too much and perhaps you won't be as disappointed as i was mostly it bored me,0
first off i really enjoyed zombi 2 by lucio fulci this film was utter trash i couldn't stand to watch it the storyline was a joke the acting was a joke and the fact that zombi 3 has nothing to do with zombi 2 is even more a joke br br we jump from voodoo to death 1 the harmful agent brining people back to life whatever this movie isn't worth the 1 00 it cost to rent it i really enjoyed lucio fulci movies but this one was horrible if zombi 3 is an indicator for how zombi 4 and 5 are going to be i think i will just skip them br br zombi 2 is an awesome flique tho,0
usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it doesn't have a lower rating and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating this is not the case here br br bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0 10 film it does nothing right and it doesn't have the chance to because it doesn't really attempt to do anything there are strands of a bad d d novel kind of plot which doesn't hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout it is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort because even a completely patently untalented persons' hard work would amount to more a truly awful film,0
takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film because i would hate to see him depart from his films i came to love visitor q gozu izo ichi the killer and black socioty trilogy lately he seems to be exploring new territory and i think he's succeeding still this was the first of his films i'd seen him take that direction so i was nervous of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i did br br great yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child neverending story labyrinth return to oz etc i enjoyed those films because they didn't treat kids like they're stupid and this one doesn't either the dark underlying morals are there but it's also as silly as any kids film should be i personally wasn't bothered by the cgi and prosthetics i feel like they fit well and don't think kids will notice br br if you are a die hard takashi miike fan you may not like this one but i suggest giving it a shot it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones which is very reassuring br br to those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one i suggest these other miike films 'zebraman' 'the happiness of the katakuris' 'sabu' and 'the bird people in china ' br br good job takashi miike 8 10 stars,1

the story of a drifter his sheep ranch boss and the boss's daughter is not for all tastes but it's still very intriguing it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand amongst the scenery we've come to know so well through other films from this region br br this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary regan and i've been a fan of hers ever since the cast also contains bruno lawrence who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film smash palace terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter regan br br sharply acted with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america but believe you me the unexpurgated version is not to be missed,1
a somewhat awkward spy mystery with a predictable plot about world war two dangers the mystery is whether or not jane graystone nancy coleman has amnesia the best acting is done by raymond massey as dr ingersoll a good doctor turned evil he is head of a spy ring attempting to get information from amnesiac jane coded information related to allied activities will she tell can she remember moroni olson as mr goodwin is convincing as an accomplice to massey the role played by john garfield as dr lewis is nothing short of disastrous he seems so badly miscast that the casting has to be ranked as one of the worst in film history it is unfortunate that so talented an actor is stuffed into a role which not befitting his talents the movie is worth one look despite being a half spy and half gangster film and despite containing a parade of stereotyped characters it's easy to forget this one amnesia is not necessary,0
this is one horror movie based tv show that gets it right friday the 13th the series had no connection to the movies poltergeist the legacy i'm not so sure it may have been loosely connected to the movies it feels like they just throw a famous title on a show so fans will watch it br br it shows freddy being burned by the elm street parents in the 1st episode i believe and the amount of parents were disappointing with all the kids he targeted in the 1st 3 movies you'd expect there to be more parents but oh well br br freddy is basically the narrator for the show he watches the actions of people in the real world sometimes getting involved somehow just like other anthology shows like tales from the crypt there's a supernatural or surprise ending twist involved br br the acting lacks but believe it or not the violence sometimes surpasses that of the movie this show lasted a couple of seasons and was made around the time of the 4th movie i heard it was canceled due to protesting parents i watched a lot of r rated stuff as a kid so its a shame parents had to ruin it for everyone 4 more movies came after the series so it wasn't a total loss,1
this was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption i loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family well acted and well directed if there were any flaws i'd have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again what about all people of all cultural backgrounds i would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown like in real life nevertheless the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes,1
i'll just be vague about my potential spoiling comments there are enough canned plot elements in this movie that it's essentially pre spoiled br br this movie derives a few ideas from a southern classic to kill a mockingbird i suppose maybe tkom got its ideas from some source at any rate after you watch this you'll say oh yeah that is a ripoff br br i think the truly entertaining thing about these mcmovies is once you've identified a plot element is to figure out whether they'll stick with the original or try to twist it around not a lot of twists in this one,0
i've now seen this one about 10 times so there must be something about it i like br br 50's us sci fi movies were pretty much a mixed bunch they were either intelligently made and or thought provoking or cheap and laughable cheese forbidden planet is a bit of both but in that rarity for the genre colour br br it also had a head start with the script although shakespeare might not have recognised it it was based on his timeless play and thus guaranteed a certain amount of longevity itself if made well br br it's the story of one mans murderous id artificially magnified infinitely by machines a dead race left switched on 200 000 years before along the way the plot bristles with 50's stereotypes and corn so pure you wonder sometimes why you're watching it but always do that love triangle thing yuk disney's cartoonery still holds up well and the cartoon backgrounds straight off the covers of galaxy magazine etc look good even after 50 years robbie driving the car over the desert in the far distance is a hoot though br br all in all with all faults the best of its kind and we should be grateful that such a pristine print survives,1
this show probably won't appeal to everyone sarah does what she wants she doesn't ask for permission and she doesn't apologize this is a sitcom with zombies robot dinosaurs flying cars and a team of wallet stealing male cheerleaders the star of the show is not a hero she is a spoiled bigoted pervert if you can't appreciate the offbeat humor it offers the show probably isn't for you everyone should at least give this show a chance it brings together the comedic styling of sarah silverman brian posehn the comedians of comedy jay johnston mr show steve agee bobcat goldthwait's 'stay' and the creative energies of rob schrab and dan harmon heat vision jack monster house it also showcases the best talents of the burgeoning online community channel101 com if you're into this show keep an eye out for the department of acceptable media on vh1 this march it'll be drawing from the same talent pool br br watch sarah silverman's show this kind of stuff is the future of entertainment,1
this movie was very enjoyable though you'll only like it if you hate going to the dentist but aren't afraid of a movie where one of them goes beserk you love horror movies br br i particularly liked the fact that some care was given to explaining the brute actions of the main character the fact that he's totally obsessed by cleanliness especially in the mouth and then catches his wives providing some oral pleasure to the mud covered pool man is a pretty believable reason to go overboard br br liked it i give it an 8,1
this movie is supposed to be a lighthearted tale about santa claus and his magical and mystical wonders but instead it comes off as being downright creepy two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as horrifying are 1 the way santa looks have you ever seen a more horrible looking santa claus and 2 the evil rep of satan pitch's just plain odd dances are just sickening to watch only watch this movie if it happens to be the msted version or if you like a very good laugh i can't believe this is a children's movie,0
saps at sea br br aspect ratio 1 37 1 br br sound format mono br br black and white br br suffering from 'hornophobia' ollie embarks on a 'restful' boat trip but he and stan get mixed up with an escaped convict rychard cramer chaos ensues br br this feature length comedy an ok entry which nonetheless unspools like a mere imitation of laurel and hardy's best work marked the final collaboration between l h and producer hal roach episodic in structure the movie culminates in a memorable ocean voyage after the boys are taken hostage by villainous cramer who shoots a seagull to prove how tough he is the gags are ok but inspiration is lacking perhaps due to the recruitment of actor turned director gordon douglas previously responsible for ollie's first solo effort in the sound era zenobia produced in 1939 but whose work here lacks a measure of pzazz fair but nothing special l h regulars charlie hall and james finlayson make guest appearances,0
ruth gordon at her best this episode is my favorite of the whole columbo series peter falk and ruth gordon worked so well together that they should both be inducted into the television hall of fame regardless of the rest of their work even the music was outstanding in this episode,1
there is this private campground in plymouth massachusetts that's been around since 1959 my grandparents were among its founders my parents had a site starting in 1965 and my two brothers have sites there now br br this doesn't have anything directly to do with the movie bear with me br br i spent summers at blueberry hill from when i was five years old to when i was eighteen and it is to people like me to whom this film speaks the ones for whom a group camp in the woods was as my fiancée tells of me the good and happy place if you've never experienced the lifestyle indian summer will probably be lost on you don't bother it's not quick paced it doesn't have rapid cuts the plots aren't in the least bit convoluted it has no explosions such dramatic tension as exists is mild there aren't any a list actors there are no rapid fire quips just to show off how clever the scriptwriters are other than perhaps kimberley williams' killer line about how her fiancé shouldn't overwind his toys that is not the least degree what this movie is about any more than the godfather is a slasher flick just because it has a lot of on screen gore br br but indian summer is godfather's polar opposite if you have experienced the lifestyle see this movie don't read any more just do it br br for me this is a 9 10 film,1
having first achieved fame with drunken master jackie chan was thrust into the spotlight once more with 1983's project a a hugely enjoyable pirate flick which re established him as a major star by the time police story was released two years later the extraordinary hype surrounding jackie was reaching its zenith and crowds flocked to see this frenetic blend of awesome stunts brutal fight scenes and questionable comedy it broke numerous box office records and inspired a 50 rise in police recruits but viewed 20 years on is it any good br br as an action movie police story unquestionably stands up there are several terrific fight scenes some stuntwork that recalls the very best of chan's hero buster keaton and a compelling if over violent climactic tussle jackie's performance is also very strong and whilst the frequent forays into laboured comedy dull the film's impact just a little his charisma carries it through furthermore in presenting our hero as a borderline psychopath whose recklessness puts others in danger jackie took a momentous gamble though in the event nobody seems to have noticed by praising police story as a simple 'good vs evil' battle critics belittled the film's ambiguity of tone and whilst it's hardly the brothers karamazov in depicting such uncertainty the film nevertheless represented a notable and praiseworthy shift from conventional ideas br br in short this remains a quality popcorn movie though you may empty your stomach as numerous villains are thrust against or deposited into glass showcases in the film's final scene a potent boisterously entertaining action movie that ranks with the best of its period,1
i thought i was going to watch a scary movie and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie in the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf i thought they was kidding todays computer games have ten times better animations low budget is a fitting comment i would recommend wolf 1994 with jack nicholson for a good werewolf movie it has good special effects as they should be human transforming to werewolf unless you wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this movie this movie is a joke,0
meet peter houseman rock star genetic professor at virgina university when he's not ballin' on the court he's blowing minds and dropping panties in his classroom lectures dr houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells allowing humans to become immortal i'd want to be immortal too if i looked like christian bale and got the sweet female lovin that only vu can offer an assortment of old and ugly university professors don't care for the popular houseman and cut off funding for his project due to lack of results this causes peter to use himself as the guinea pig for his serum much to my amazement there are side effects and he get this metamorphoses into something that is embedded into our genetic dna that has been repressed for millions of years he also beds dr mike's crush sally after a whole day of knowing her she has a son his name is tommy he is an angry little boy br br metamorphosis isn't a terrible movie just not a well produced one the whole time i watched this i couldn't get past the fact that this was filmed in 1989 the look and feel of the movie is late seventies quality at the latest it does not help that it's packaged along with 1970's movies as metamorphosis is part of mill creek entertainment's 50 chilling classics there is basically no film quality difference whatsoever the final five minutes are pure bad movie cheese that actually for me at least save the movie from a lower rating pay attention to the computer terminology such as cromosonic anomaly no wonder peter's experiment failed your computer can't spell this is worthy of a view followed by a trip to your local tavern,0
it's one of the best movies i've seen in the last 2 years i've seen the premier in tel aviv israel in the summer of 2006 exactly when the last war has began this problem in communication between the people that causes wars is interesting me for a long time and it doesn't matter who boys and girls straight and gays jews and arabs i've seen the bubble already 3 times and it still surprising and exciting me each character reminds me of one of the many people i know and the difference between them like between tel aviv and jerusalem the last time i saw it was with my friend who is a christian arab and it was on the independence day of israel the most symbolic i could how ironic and he cried in the end if he's been touched and wasn't embarrassed everyone would be touched by the bubble,1
if you want your vision of chaplin limited to a lovable tramp and you get your belly laughs from pathos watch something else if however you love slapstick comedy as performed by one of the best do watch this one br br the image is of the tramp who really cannot get the girl he spots another couple kissing on a park bench and he has a blast ruining their fun br br this is one of chaplin's park comedies filmed in mack sennett's park with pickpockets and cops and couples these shorts work as the format allows chaplin to shine as he weaves through predicaments br br i checked the box as this could be considered a spoiler though it's not if you've seen these films everyone ends up in the pond except chaplin he gets the girl who in this case was played by minta durfee a k a mrs roscoe fatty arbuckle,1
yesterday i saw the movie flyboys and my girlfriend told me it was the worst movie she's ever seen since i thought it was pretty awful as well it got me thinking which film was the worst film i had ever seen and this was the only film that came to mind br br unfortunately it was a couple of years since i've seen it but i remember the horribly miscast dean cain as cocky military man pretty boy cain doesn't do cocky very well the strange deal with the cgi helicopter when it would probably be cheaper to rent a chopper than to hire some cgi guys to make it but my guess is that they found the chopper as a free sample for some cgi program or the producer's son liked to play with his new computer and how did it look awful and when the dragon charges through the corridors of the complex then reuse the same shots over and over looks very cheap br br avoid this movie it is truly awful,0
it's a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome the guy is cute too so it's a good match if you want to the guy or the girls,1
i've given up trying to figure out what version of this i'm watching the copyright at the end indicates 1983 and though this is not the important bit of my objection to this film i will say that watching a film obviously made in the aquarian age including long haired hippie chicks and odious station wagons but with a 1980s synth soundtrack is unsettling extremely unsettling br br my main objection here is how dare the filmmakers bury cute as a button pamela franklin alive how dare they br br seriously she's all like adorable and stuff but in the two movies i've seen her in this crapfest and the otherwise excellent legend of hell house they kill her off br br i would like to put the film industry on notice pamela franklin has apparently retired from the business but if she ever decides to do another film and some blasted cur of a director attempts to kill her off i shall ask him to step outside br br no one beats up on pamela franklin and gets away with it i am quite cross the fury has been unleashed br br for b movie fans seeking out a crapfest you could do much worse than this on the plus side this is not a film which involves satanism in a peripheral and circumspect way this movie is a hardcore satanic film br br wall to wall satanic ceremonies baphomets hallucinations a ludicrous rat attack what else could you ask for br br this excellent stuff is quite nearly ruined by the baffling grafted on 1980s synth soundtrack which is about as mismatched to a film as it is possible to be the soundtrack reminded me of something you'd hear on the equalizer it's really bad br br also they made pamela franklin squash her charming english accent which was also quite rude if not a cruel atrocity against the viewer such as you might find covered by the universal declaration of human rights i say that we have a right to hear pamela franklin speak in her own voice who's with me i could forgive everything else about this film if they didn't abuse pamela franklin and so i throw the gauntlet down sirs anyone who messes with pamela franklin messes with me br br even in a fictional context br br good day sirs,0
in this film we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to timon and pumbaa in the film when they are not shown which is a lot this film even goes back to before simba and presumbably just after the birth of kiara br br quite true to the first film lion king 1 2 or lion king 3 in other places is a funny entertaining exciting and surprising film or sequel if that's what you want to call it a bundle of surprises and hilarity await for you br br while timon and pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema with a remote control timon and pumbaa have an argument of what point of the lion king they are going to start watching as timon wants to go to the part when he and pumbaa come in and pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning they have a very fair compromise of watching the film of their own story which is what awaits it starts with timon's first home br br for anyone with a good sense of humour who liked the first films of just about any age enjoy lion king 1 2,1
bye bye birdie isn't one of the best musicals of all time but it's great fun and accessible to many audiences the original film could have been wonderful with dick van dyke reprising his signature broadway role but instead they tinkered with the plot so the film is very unsatisfying this re make which aired on abc in 1995 is far more faithful to the original script and includes some original songs as well that were used in a national tour which this film took off from which starred tommy tune and ann reinking who choreographed this film br br jason alexander is a very different type from dick van dyke but he is well cast as albert before his seinfeld days he started in musical theater vanessa williams is a perfect fit for rose their is also great work from tyne daly as mae and mark kudisch as conrad birdie a role he played on the national tour br br this film is not without it's problems though a major liability is chynna phillips who however appealing simply looks and seems too old to be teenage kim and george wendt is somewhat bland as her father somewhat throwing the number kids away a number original cast member paul lynde stole the show with br br but all in all this is a delightful well done film which the material deserved,1
i love playing football and i thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it this was a good hollywood bollywood film and i am glad it won 17 awards parminder nagra and kiera knightley were good and so was archie punjabi jonathon rheyes meyers was great at playing the coach jazz parminder nagra loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married when jazz starts playing for a football team secretly she meets juliet kiera knightlety and joe jonathon rhyes meyers who is her coach when her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters pinky archie punjabi's wedding at the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play,1
the first part of grease with john travolta and olivia newton john is one of the best movie for teens this one is a very bad copy the change is only in the sex in the first one the good one was sandy here it's michael i prefer to watch the first grease,0
visually stunning and full of eastern philosophy this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director tsui hark the man behind some of the best films hong kong cinema has produced the special effects are beautiful and imaginative the plot is a bit on the cerebral side but is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons if thinking is not your forte however this may not be your movie maybe you should go see the latest from the hollywood studio's no brain club but if you are looking for something more he's where you will find it,1
this show is awesome i thought that the two episodes where paul died were so sad i actually cried but the other shows were awesome kerry was my favorite character because she was in the dark side i also thought that bridget was funny because she was all perky i also thought that guy who played kyle was really really cute i loved it when kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything the guy who played rory was cute and paul played by john ritter was really funny this whole entire tv show is funny and i wish they still showed it on tv when they did show it on tv though i watched it every single time it was on the next time it shows i will watch it over and over again,1
to be honest i had to go see this movie backwards didn't expect that much but hey i was not deceived i had a good time br br i would say this movie is way a fresh breeze despite some facts that they tried to modernize nancy drew but this made me remember these youth movies of the 60 70s from europe and quebec where they manage to have children getting interacting with adults in this case a 16 year old teenager tries to do justice by trying to solve a mystery concerning the death of an actress who died 25 years ago anyway as her dad had business in hollywood why not rent a home with a mystery behind doors well at least emma roberts does a great job here kinda like the chubby kid who at first is naively brought to support his sister's pranks to nancy but at the end found nancy quite cool enough to stick with her even with her matters br br rest of the supporting cast is great and was happy to see rachael leigh cook in a different role this time a single mother she did it in family rescue but this time she plays a mature woman anyway don't dump this it is fun,1
i honestly want the last 30 minuets of my life back br br the only person that is fit to watch this movie is helen keller i kept saying to myself this has to get better this has to get better br br then the zombies finally showed up and they had some raccoon paint on there eyes br br they talked like regular people br br one drove a car br br some voodoo woman asked what one of the zombies wanted and the zombie said i want to dance br br that was it out came the movie i couldn't take it any longer can i sue for a ½ hour of my life,0
im going to keep this fairly brief as to not spoil anything for you this movie is awesome from beginning to end it is filled with genuine thrills the fight scenes are fantastic the chase scenes are enthralling and it moves at such a pace that it really only felt slow toward the end when things are explained but that is only because everything that preceded it damon shines and really has proved a very solid actor daring you not to believe him in this role he is this role a welcome addition to the series in david straithrain hope i spelled that close to right as a seedy cia agent out to kill bourne this is non stop and will truly leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way some things toward the end are just a smidgeon preposterous thus negating a 10 rating the ending is left open for sequels and i sure hope that they consider doing more of these for none have been bad excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy br br p s the shaky cam did not hurt any of the action but i still think we could do without it the good news is you only really notice it when people are talking and not so much the action,1
i've watched it plenty of times and i'm planning on buying the full feature i love all of jason steele's comedy it's very different and unique and is very enjoyable i love indie films and this one is just great the plot is strange but very funny this short film is about a talking spatula named edward the order of the events are a bit jumbled making this film very interesting to watch at first you see edward fighting the spoons but then the focus changes to earlier in his life this is a silly movie but of course it's still great i highly recommend that you watch this film at www spatulamadness com or www filmcow com it's very funny the humour may not match everybody's taste but watch anyway it'll only take 16 minutes of your time and it's free go watch spatula madness,1
anna ursula andress is brought in as an official r n by ex lover benito varotto duilio del prete ostensibly to nurse an aging widower count leonida bottacin mario piso back to health after a heart attack but benito is actually leading a group of heirs and businessmen including american entrepreneur mr kitch jack palance with ulterior motives reflected by what anna hopefully will actually accomplish with the count he has a history of well liking women and would be actually a bit more vulnerable as he is cured the bad guys get derailed as anna does not go along and grows closer to the count the ending might be said to be ironic but it is probably better described as predictable br br but so much for plot this film is totally an erotic comedy from start to finish and oh how good there are many nude scenes including ones of anna and jole one of the malevolent heiresses played by luciana paluzzi both ursula and luciana are noteworthy continental ex bond women and thus fulfill the fantasies of male viewers as she did in thunderball remember fiona volpe luciana plays a femme fatale sort of although less elegantly br br perhaps the best scene is anna's slow complete strip and jump in bed with the young adone the other patient who incredibly is resisting in an attempt to find out what he knows about the plot but even at this point she is already two faced for the better for she has decided not to go along however benito is more than a two timer with women having had lengthy flings in the past with both anna and jole and the rival best erotic scene follows an invective filled to put it mildly argument between him and jole this is a standing up encounter in which luciana is down to black panties only another nice one is ursula swimming fully naked in the estate's pool the count is free as the client to put his hands wherever he wants to on ursula and he takes advantage hey somehow i've gone back to the actresses' names in my descriptions erotic scenes involving other women include an amusing naked wine cellar chase the sensuous nurse is compact 77 minutes but it doesn't need to be it is enjoyable without interruption start to finish definitely recommended br br,1
i had to walk out of the theater after an hour all i was seeing was people cheating on wives schtupping like dogs in a rut and using the f word like a diabetic using equal br br no thanks br br it was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot any one of the characters could have been quite interesting if they were given more to do than fornicate talk about it and swear at each other br br the few times that it looked as if there were about to be some sort of character development all that happened was another sex scene plot development in the 1st hour can be summarized as 1 several murders occur 2 vinnie sees murder scene 3 vinnie stares moodily across atlantic east hudson river 4 vinnie cheats on wife and 5 joey most sympathetic character in the show gets kicked out of his parents' house more than that i didn't wait to see br br the photography and the interplay between the characters were superb but there was nothing for them to do the flood of sex and vulgarity was hardly worth waiting another hour for something to happen br br sorry spike take some lessons from notting hill or shawshank redemption either one is a better study in community and interpersonal relationships,0
this game is amazing really you should get it if you don't have it although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out i believe that this game will always be a classic it's just as good a super mario world or so when i was young my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did it's not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential it's fun entertaining and challenging everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics well it did come out in 1996 rock on 4eva mario luigi and yoshi nintendo is the best,1
i was treated to a viewing of cracker bag last night before a preview screening of disney's holes i don't know who decided to show it but i'm so very glad they did cracker bag is an absolute gem a snapshot of australia in the early 80s as seen through a child's eye the conversations between eddie and her brother were hilarious and as with the rest of the film so true to life each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia as it reminded me of my own childhood being the same age as the director probably helps a little and the audio multiplied the feeling i only hope i get to see cracker bag again some day,1
man on fire was hot i love a classic tale of good ol' revenge and what better cause for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl br br the writers did an excellent job in this movie of building the relationship between creasy denzel washington and pita dakota fanning so that the viewer would understand and actually feel the drive creasy had to rescue pita it was also good that creasy wasn't a choir boy type trying to rescue pita through the proper channels but instead used torture tactics and street smarts some may say torture is wrong regardless and you may be right but when you see the pain creasy goes through due to the loss of pita and the sheer passion he has for getting her back you can't help but side with creasy and pull for him to be even more merciless there would be no progress if creasy used diplomacy to deal with the different nefarious gangsters and criminals and he knew that br br creasy's quest ended with the return of pita to her mother and creasy dying in the vehicle of the bad guys but creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the movie it in fact enhanced it by showing that creasy was willing to die to get pita back his death was noble in fact br br denzel does an excellent job as do the writers this movie deserves good marks because it definitely was a good movie,1
henry thomas was great his character held my attention i was so into the story that i forgot it wasn't real i wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was the other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character the way they banded together to help one another was truly awe inspiring i love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you over the head in that you are not smart enough to figure things out for yourself,1
the bat people is a really bad film that deserved the mst3k treatment just as well like that other film the creeping terror br br in it we are in some sort of mountainous terrain full of bats we see many things happen like bats flying out and attacking and stuff station wagon chases mishaps at the emergency room and much more all this plus the cheesy mediocrity of the 1970s hey think mitchell here making the bat people actually one of the very best of the last mystery science theater 3000 episodes made in the series moviewise it's awful it should be avoided like the plague unless tom servo and crow are watching with you br br the bat people more like the bad people lol br br 1 10 of course,0
right away this film was ridiculous not that it didn't have redeeming aspects for example the best thing about this film was the beautiful background scenery anyone not living on the east coast should know the south doesn't have beautiful mountains like those found in the west i knew it was utah right off the bat but perhaps dalton couldn't suppress his english accent so they had to excuse it by saying this was a southern town subverting his accent into a southern one was easier sure the film has plot twists but its phony sense of place was something i couldn't get past it's not like utah doesn't have meth labs so why the writers thought it necessary to pretend it was in the south is beyond me br br one other thing in action pictures always puzzles me why do they always make the cocking sound effect when the character pulls out an automatic handgun it seemed every other sound effect in this movie was a chuk chich signifying a 9mm was loaded and ready to fire of course the weapons already had rounds chambered so this was unnecessary br br lastly the pyrotechnics were way over the top but hey this film was targeted to a certain 'market segment' i suppose it's too bad each of the actors can act but this film was lame,0
this movie should have been named need for speed the movie for those who have not played the games need for speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot this applies perfectly to redline the only thing about this movie that was a level were the cars the acting seemed forced and scripted the premise was flimsy at best and the plot was almost nonexistent i only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and while it was pretty bad it could have been worse and at least it was entertaining i just wish they had showed eddie griffin crashing the enzo somewhere in the movie all in all don't pay for it don't go out of your way to see it but if it's on showtime or hbo and there isn't anything else on it's a decent distraction,0
the only enjoyable thing about this highly mockable movie is playing guess that location what toronto landmark will stand in for what american international location br br who knew that the anti christ would be russian obviously he can't be american since we need the yanks to save the day oh buck you'll tell us all the truth you'll show us the light and the way outta the building should those nasty anti christers get their way br br five golden raspberries faith is not enough to hope they don't make another of this ilk we don't gotta prayer,0
it was hard for me to believe all of the negative comments regarding this all star flick i laughed through the entire picture as did my entire family the movie clearly defined itself as an old time gangster comedy the players were hysterical i'll bet they had a good old time while making it of course goldblum and dreyfuss were great and how about those everly sisters each of the two falco's and the divine music throughout rob reiner made a great laughing limo driver and gabriel byrne a laughable neurotic not to mention gregory hines burt reynolds the sleepy joe character and the whole mortuary and grave digger references paul anka was his usual entertaining self with the added attraction of running scared after byrne decided to make a duet of his my way welcome home to vick performance br br i am of the opinion that this movie was a comical tribute to frank sinatra and friends dreyfuss imitated him well i am also of the opinion that no one of any age would even think of imitating the actions which occurred in this movie it's a joke not a terrifying gangsta film the cars and clothing were impressive as was the decorative vic's place br br truly i think of mad dog time as a musical comedy less harmful than many cartoons tv crime dramas and talk shows i would recommend the video for an evening of family entertainment,1
other than some neat special effects this movie has nothing to offer they threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting but with no success kevin bacon's acting was pretty good but he couldn't salvage the movies lack of plot,0
i was first introduced to eddie by friends from across the pond who know i like intelligent humor i prefer comedians who can be thought provoking while entertaining such as george carlin and dennis miller in 'dress to kill' eddie provides the same type of social observation humor that stimulates your thoughts on a subject all the while causing your side to split at the same time there is a wide range of subjects in this stand up and they are simply hysterical the piece on how to decide on englebert's stage name will leave you in stitches br br thanks andrew and catherine and do you have a flag,1
it's a bit easy that's about it br br the graphics are clean and realistic except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d but that's forgiveable the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n64 games the sounds are magnificant everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic br br the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times but it's the same for every platform game like banjo kazooie and donkey kong 64 br br i got this game as a christmas present in 1997 and since then i have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times,1

my teacher taped this and showed it to us in child care to demonstrate how teen pregnancy affects people it just demonstrated how teen pregnancy affects a childish jock not properly educated on how sex works and a whiny unloved girl who throws fruit when angry and couldn't tell she was with the wrong man even if he wore a sign stating he was such i wouldn't be surprised if the father of the baby had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script stacy's the carrier of the baby mother is a riot she is oblivious to the fact her daughter is past the age of four and is seemingly unshaken when people spy on her through her dining room window bobby's the father best friend's name is dewey and is an obvious rip off of sean penn's character in fast times at ridgemont high this movie is horrid simply because none of the characters are believable thank goodness it's only made for tv limiting the public's chances of viewing it,0

if i accidentally stumbled across this script in textual form i would read it and maybe laugh i would not however laugh at the points in the film where the director would seem to want me to laugh although i am still not altogether sure where these are i don't care if this is woody allen this writer cannot write dialogue or at least he cannot knowingly write dialogue then draw performances from actors capable of drawing laughter from even the most ticklish of clowns for example br br paraphrase i'm an art historian i'm looking to get a job in an art gallery br br ok so it states the fact but honestly do you know of any art historians who would say that how would you answer br br really an art gallery who would've thought it br br the entire script is littered with the kind of tawdry quasi intellectualism that i would not have expected from such a respected character writer i admit that i have no knowledge of allen's other work and judging by this one i don't want to start learning the characters are loathsome without exception an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from the human condition or really really poor character writing you be the judge,0
truly this is a 'heart warming' film it won the george peobody award winning over roots so that may tell you something of the essence of this film i am looking on the internet how to order this movie since my former father in law eugene logan the co writer of this film has been deceased for a few years now so i no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him i would love to have his only grand daughters my daughters see this film as well as to pass this wonderful story on to his great grandsons my oldest daughter was seven years old at the time it was aired on television and i since have been looking forward to seeing it again one of my friends said it was her favorite movie i won't 'spoil' this movie for you,1

first of all this movie is not a comedy unless you really force yourself you can hardly laugh secondly the movie is slow and boring the acting is not bad but not special there is a lucky luke comic about two families one with big noses and one with big ears fighting each other in a small town you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule there is a similar subject comedy '' the home teachers'' this had some good moments my final comment is do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring film,0
have i seen a worse movie perhaps only manos the hands of fate dragged more than dukes i had more fun poking at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point let's touch on a few br br there was a noticeable script death and rebirth when sheev is talking to the dukes and they don't respond he shrugs and moves on since neither the knoxville or scott know what he's talking about nor do we it was like the engine died and was restarted br br the few times the general lee flew through the air weren't even that exciting nothing i haven't seen on the tv series br br very little chemistry between knoxville and scott the best part was when bo is upset at luke for stealing the girl he liked the only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it although roughly the rest of the time it seems distant and forced br br seann william scott's awful horrendous accent or lack thereof br br i hated willie nelson's performance were bad jokes supposed to be endearing i wanted him to disappear br br jessica simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen she actually felt like one of the better actors in the film that's telling you how horrible this movie is she's a goddess br br during the climax of the film i was rooting for boss hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of hazzard county starting with willie nelson and his accomplices a nuclear bomb would have sufficed br br this is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly heartwarming film br br if only we could erase and start over,0
andy goldsworthy is a taoist master of the first order expressing the way through his sublime ephemeral art indeed time and change is what his work is fundamentally about i bought his first book several years ago and my family has marveled at it many times so it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world the deepest of which are expressed in his occasional inability to say it in words at all he is like most children who play in the great outdoors alone if they do anymore creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it mr goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission to extend that sort of play to create profound visions of nature and to open our often weary eyes to it in brilliant new ways and always with the utmost respect gratitude and humor of a wandering and wondering monk,1

why was this film made even keeping in mind the generous tax concessions that australian film investors were given there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the go ahead for goodness sakes the actors cast in this film are aussie b grade celebs not actors people like john michael 'hollywood' howson the original drummer from the band in hey hey its saturday and the voice over guy in countdown but in saying that this is still very watchable as long as you give it the brain attention it deserves none the script is bad even for a self confessed b grade horror and the acting and film quality is worse it often looks as though it is a home movie but even a home movie has 'realism' anyone interested in australian cinema please for the love of god pretend this film was never made,0

overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come although the plot is not 100 accurate to the book most everything is correct the movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts i found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie because i hadn't found out about the movie yet but later i found the movie in a bargain bin at wal mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what i had expected overall i give this movies a 7 out of 10 for its good parts relative accuracy and overall making sense and for its bad parts large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies,1
'chances are' a big mistake to see you could know director emile ardolino from 'dirty dancing' and 'sister act' and should expect something amusing from him but i guess i have to disillusion you he made a really really bad movie br br according to the story christopher mcdonald dies to reburn as a baby the baby grows up robert downey jr and jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter mary stuart masterson complicated huh br br they fall in love with each other then appears jr former wife cybill shepherd and jr falls in love with her too i guess i don't even have to mention that she loves ryan o'neil br br in one of his first roles robert downey jr's on his worst he copies michael j fox br br after the 'moonlighting' shepherd proves that she's not suitable for acting in movies br br anyway there's one thing this unfunny comedy can be used as antidote to insomnia,0
i can remember seeing this movie as a kid in 1977 or 1978 hbo would show it late at night back when they were they one and only movie pay channel in existence back then it was unrated and was the only movie of its kind ever shown on pay television especially back then i would love to see it now as an adult where i would be more apt to understand the adult theme of it it was probably the closest thing i had ever seen to pornography at the young age of 7 or 8 luckily i had stupid babysitters and party going parents on the weekends most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys breaking into houses to sniff underwear feeding on a stranger's breast milk on a public bus and fornicating in a cab at the request of one of their female subjects were just a few of the whacked escapades these guys were pulling off a very racy film for the early '70s until i checked imdb i had no idea this movie had such a following most people i talk to have never heard of it,1
i was a bit scared to watch this movie due to its rates but living in italy titles like this never ever come across and i love step so much that i decided to give it try and how surprised i was the story is different from any other dance movie i've seen lately with a deeper meaning than just winning it's touching and well written and well directed raya is such a strong character i love the fact that she never doubts herself she's so mature and focused and aware of her talent and what talent rutina wesley has my jaw dropped in the final dance scene the way she pursues her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is honestly inspiring also the fact that she's not the typical super hot chick see jessica alba briana evigan jenna dewan zoe seldana makes her really appealing and real seriously why is this movie rated so low you can understand between the first 5 minutes that it's a good work really good actually i even cried at the end of the movie and the dancing routines are just sick,1
after too many bad memories i took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the season 2 sequence i recently watched it again just to remind me why i've always considered this the worst st tng episode with the exception of shades of gray which barely counts as an episode at all br br i keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red penciled by the author's writing 101 teacher show don't tell from deanna troi's pronouncement and everyone else's constant elbowing reminders about what a charming dangerous rogue okona is to guinan's explanation about how funny her droid joke is it isn't to the who cares resolution to the conflict there isn't a plot point that isn't highlighted and triple underlined for our edification and there ain't a believable moment in any of it unfortunately bill campbell a charming actor in other circumstances is too puppy dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot on the other hand it could be that no one short of john barrowman jack harkness from doctor who could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role br br zero points by the way to the data subplot while i think joe piscopo stopped being funny decades ago he and brent spiner had nothing to work with here although the jerry lewis bit was funny in a stupid way br br on a good day you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser original series episode me i'd rather skip ahead to time squared or q who,0
if you haven't seen this yet i say just move on take a walk in the park don't waste your time neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money spoilers i can't decide which was worse the movie itself or baldwin's hairstyle ellen pompeo's acting talent is very questionable i hope she can improve it over time the storyline is just unbelievable loose cannon american cop fighting criminals in europe on his own infamous slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunks an emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang spanish police executive dumber than a sack of hammers give me a break there's only one good thing about this movie though at least the production costs must be lower than ocean's 12 's which was as meaningless and over the top as this one,0
this show has come so far at first everyone in the cast from eric to fez they were all new actors and actresses fresh faces and just look what they accomplished they stuck with the show and it was a success its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom i've ever seen in my life it will be sad to see it end but if they end this show i hope to god that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had i don't care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode go down swinging get one last punch in the show deserves it the fans deserve it if they go let everyone know its going to end like on friends and let the finale be huge i say get donna and eric married i say have hyde and kelso fight and become friends again i say have something interesting happen between fez and jackie because fez has been trying for so long but of course it wont work out for him just close out the series big time guys br br that 70s show will always be the best in my eyes eric kelso donna jackie fez hyde i wish i had you guys as friends you are the best br br 10 10,1
this was another world war ii message to the soldiers and to the allies to be careful about spreading rumors these were called instructional cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny looking main character called pvt snafu br br all of us have imaginations along with fears and what have you and that's what happens here as pvt snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with five you can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them that includes losing confidence in your country and your cause as pointed out here in this cartoon a good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy that's still being done today br br we lost the war declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon amazing how some americans still haven't learned this cartoon may be 65 years old but it sure has relevance today as i write this there were two terrorist bombings in europe today and some people still think the war on terror is just a bumper sticker slogan amazing br br the writer the famous dr suess uses analogies of hot air balloon juice here to present the above message with theodore geisel his real name you know the rhymes will be clever br br nothing hilarious here but it wasn't meant to be you have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was out there during world war ii people forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning it was a tense time,1

you already know how painful to watch this movie is but i wonder why one of the worst movies ever should include one the most beautiful cars why the cars should be not only the victim of violation but also the only true actors and performers in it so how on earth you porsche lamborghini or whatever could allow those people to get in touch with your cars and ruin you reputation for which you give millions stop the getting an advantage of the cars and earn money on their chests it is painful for those who love cars it is painful for those who love movies br br i want my money back,0
although this film is somewhat sanitized because it was made at a time when people just didn't talk about sex it is an extremely helpful short film to show prepubescent girls so they know what to expect during menstruation not surprisingly it was paid for by the kotex company though what may surprise many is that disney made this film as they made a lot of educational films during the 1940s 60s however well made the film is though i think the film maker's missed a real opportunity instead of the nice female narrator's voice and the relatively bland visuals it would have been great if they'd used minnie mouse and the rest of the disney gang i know this would have given old walt a heart attack but wow that would have been a great film by the way although the notion of sex is barely hinted at in the film it does adequately explain menstruation in general however it does lack some details especially about intercourse that i assume were included in the accompanying booklet br br now if only i can figure out why i watched a cartoon about menstruation,1
i don't understand why making remakes has become the trend every remake i have ever seen is awful and this is no exception if any of you have seen the quote from ben jones that it is a sleazy piece of trash he is quite right why they would take a wonderful television show which i loved have never missed an episode and own seasons 1 4 on dvd and ruin it i'll never know the television show was a family show and although daisy has the body it was really flaunted or even addressed in the show save the outfits a family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage and i wouldn't recommend anyone go see it another thing i didn't like was that john schneider and tom wopat are excellent actors along with the rest of the original cast and they are also extremely cute the new bo and luke are not even a little cute that was one of the drawers for the show the casting is terrible they could have at least gotten a brunette for daisy i don't think burt reynolds is a qualified boss hogg either every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role the only role they cast halfway decent is willie nelson as uncle jesse but still it is no comparison denver pyle is an actor all his own and that made him perfect for the role i think that the casting is awful the story is awful and all in all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty terrible movie i wouldn't recommend anyone go see it i only saw it out of curiosity plus there was a free ticket in season 4 dvd i would never have paid to see this movie but it was free don't pay to see this movie,0
i saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless an ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas the victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man they drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off or duh burn him quentin alias mr fabersham of the honeymooners is married to diane brewster alias miss canfield of leave it to beaver fame who is unhappy in marriage wow love plot the rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid the egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film where is the mummy really just a curse unleashed this does not hold a torch to universal mummy films in the least watch this movie if you need sleep because you will dose off,0
is it just me or is that kid really annoying br br hideos sister spends most of her time running around after the disobedient little so and so as for him well i know he's a kid n all but his acting ability is about as wooden as a dead tree so far i'm only half way through and am fascinated by the story but the people in it let it down i just hope it gets better by the end as i can't not know what it's all about although some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a notebook indicate everything is backwards i e dog is god live is evil etc just seems a little obvious at the moment yet nobody mentions its obvious meaning as yet anyway if my opinion changes at the end of the movie i'll update this post but if your reading this then well see above statement,0
although this film was made before dogme emerged as the predominant method of filmmaking and before digital triumphed over strike that you get the point this 1991 masterpiece clearly anticipated those developments corin nemec is just outstanding as the ne'er do well author and narrator the pace is slow but elegantly so because the cinematography is so beautiful record it the next time its on t v because i guarantee you'll never see a better nostalgia rip off made for t v movie direct to video never felt so good,0
first of all i love good splattermovies and am not afraid to get in touch with art but this zero budget flick is none of it the picture quality is so damned low the soundtrack the most annoying one i ever heard and as for the fx well the super low quality makes some of them look not as bad as they would in a real movie what this junk here isn't no concept a wafer thin storyline primitive acting and rare dialog i think i counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie each one repeated about 20 times same for a lot of film sequences may be an indication for which kind of audience this crap was made the story seems to be that a young boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother got psychological damaged and as an adult goes touring performing a show of self mutilation so far so good but for these pseudo art idiot directors this plot is just a line to put cheap produced shock scenes in a row which neither have a message nor make any sense freshly taken out bowels are thrown on a naked bound woman in an earth hole why and why is that the only time you see both woman and thrower in the whole bloody movie disturbing yes sick yes necessary no artistically no everyone mistaking this cheap gore show for art should as soon as possible visit his psychiatrist or should watch pink floyd's the wall to see how a similar topic can be worked out in an artful way i hope this was your first and last movie andrew cobb and all you gore heads out there remember not everything that looks cheap and makes obviously no sense at all is automatically art,0
i've had a thing for this kari chick for a while and as far as how she looked in this movie no complaints but after catching it last night in high definition i am certain that's the only thing in the movie that isn't substandard the script is horrible the acting is horrible the direction is horrible i saw in another comment someone commenting on how great the sex scenes were what not at all when a movie is this bad you might as well just turn it into softcore porn but instead i get to see some pasty white dude blocking me from seeing wuhrer's body and scenes that offer me nothing except a tease they should have just gone cinemax so that the movie wasn't a complete waste of time but no with a script this awful they should've capitalized on wuhrer's looks since that's the lone pro of the movie 2 10 only because she looked so hot,0
i read john everingham's story years ago in reader's digest and i remember thinking what a great movie it would make and it probably would have been had michael landon never got his hands on it as far as i'm concerned landon was one of the worst actors on earth and his artistic license went way over the top similar to his massacre of the little house book series is proof the acting for lack of a better word is atrocious the screenplay sloppy and there are more close ups of landon's puss than should be allowed br br this movie reflects everingham's story as much as little house on the prairie reflects the books is was based on it's just another vehicle to show off landons horrendous hair,0
'metamoprhis' is the story of a dashing young scientist revered at the local college is brought under investigation by financial providers for the college this forces him to take shortcuts in typical bad hollywood melodramatic fashion br br my first thought after this movies conclusion was this not good but not bad for early to mid eighties of course i then realized that it was made in 1990 which almost propelled it down to a '4' but decided to keep it at the mediocre '5' that it is br br 'metamorphis' does on a few occasions seem like a good movie desperately trying to get out the acting while not stellar is mostly competent you can even see the occasional glisten of a modest quality pacing is a large problem with the movie after thinking i had been watching for ninety minutes i realized i'd only been watching an hour special effects aren't stellar but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around that weakness br br the lead a mildly charismatic male that seems to be attempting a blended channeling of tom cruise and christopher reeves reminded me mostly of matt dillon's character in 'wild things' the female heroine does an ok job but does not distinguish herself in anyway there's a 'naughty girl' role in here and the actress does what she can with it but it doesn't seem like much there is a child actor that the director can't decide if he's morose cheerful or just weird br br pacing as i said is the worst problem with this movie until a final battle with the bad guy that would make a power ranger blush it is bizarre and inexplicable until the final scene which is supposed to be dramatic but simply hilarious saturated with every bad camera trick and overacting that can be compressed in about thirty seconds br br a decent one time watch on the 'mill creek 50 chilling movie pack' nothing that is going to bring you back and nothing to buy on its own,0
the dream child of 1989 is the fifth film in the generally overrated nightmare series and at the latest from this point on the series became total garbage the only good films in the series were wes craven's 1984 original and the third part the dream warriors of 1987 the second part was disappointing and boring and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman freddy krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes this fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for admittedly great visuals and one creepy scene a flashback sequence to how freddy krueger came into existence the rest of the film consists mainly of our razor clawed maniac turned jokester yelling stupid one liners and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses who desperately try to avoid falling asleep because good old freddy awaits them in their dreams lisa wilcox is back in the role of alice johnson and a bunch of uninteresting crap such as a super dumb 'eerie' children's rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel in short no originality just a decline of the old formula and an over load of painfully annoying jokes my generous rating of 3 10 is due to the great visuals and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel freddy's dead which is awful beyond belief in case you're not a hardcore freddy krueger enthusiast the dream child should be avoided and even if you are this is more than likely to disappoint,0
deliriously romantic comedy with intertwining subplots that mesh beautifully and actors who bounce lines off each other with precise comic timing a feat that is beautiful to behold when cher's spineless fiancé asks her to help him make peace with his estranged moody younger brother no one could dream the consequences which follow operatic symbolism catholic church confessions love bites and falling snow moonstruck is timeless and smooth it takes about 15 minutes for the picture's rhythm to kick in there's an early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the cemetery that's a little rough and a following scene with cosmo and the elderly man at the gate that seems obtuse but the patchwork of the plot is interwoven with nimble skill and the movie's wobbly tone and kooky spirit are both infectious 1 2 from,1

imagine that you are asked by your date what movie you wanted to see and you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer about the grudge so in good faith you recommend seeing that movie it is the halloween season after all and it did boffo box office this past weekend so it must be pretty good so you go br br and you're actually in a state of shock when the movie ends the way it does and you hear yourself audibly saying that can't be the end of the movie but alas it is br br and imagine coming out of the movie theater being embarrassed and ashamed for recommending such a dog of a movie you think that your date thinks you're a bonehead for suggesting such an atrocity and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship actually it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was i see no future for miss gellar in the movies and suggest that she sticks to television in the future actually it won't be long before she is consigned to flea market conventions selling buffy memorabilia and it can't happen soon enough if you ask me horrible horrible horrible the plot didn't make sense continuity was terrible it's apparent that the whole ending was contrived to have a grudge ii the return of 'cat boy',0
it was a disappointment to see this dvd after so many years for me the main problem's the uneven script br br while some of it is witty and hip quite a bit of it is dull unfunny and lifeless many of the gags just sit there lacking spark and energy br br of the cast mae west and rachel welch come over well roger herren in the role of rusty shines too bad he didn't make more films but for my money there's just too much of john huston and poor rex reed isn't hardly given a fighting chance his character seems relegated to skim around on the sidelines wondering what he's doing in this film br br the low user rating should give an idea as to the public's opinion of this piece vidal's original provided much potential that was pretty much wasted not even the 'classic' film clips did much all in all a rather sub par effort and it's not likely to get much better with time,0
it was extremely low budget it some scenes it looks like they recorded with a home video recorder however it does have a good plot line and its easy to follow 8 years after shooting her sexually abusive step father amanda is released from the psychiatric ward with the help of her doctor who she is secretly having an affair with the doctor ends up renting her a house and buying her a car but within the first 20 minutes of the movie amanda kills him and buries him in her backyard then she see's her neighbor richard sets eyes on him and stops at nothing until she has him she acts innocent but after another neighbor buzz finds out that amanda killed that doctor and attempted to kill richards wife laurie this is after amanda and him get it on in the hot tub then she stops acting so innocent and kills buzz and later on attempts to kill richard whom she supposedly loves and cares for and you'll have to rent the movie to find out if amanda dies or not overall good movie reminds me a lot of my life you know the whole falling for the neighbor and stopping at nothing until you have him part,1
there is only one use for a film such as bulletproof it reminds you just how bad bad can be we often see films which we describe as pretty awful or not much good but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films aren't good they are no way as stinkingly bad as bulletproof this was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru' the dvd bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation i e to give me a present it could have been a serendipitous find but it wasn't this is so utterly clichéd so badly written so poorly directed so badly acted that i'm surprised everyone involved hasn't been arrested and sent down for 10 years god it's awful i suspected as much from about 30 seconds in but carried on because sometimes sometimes bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable this isn't one of them it is simply bad i stopped watching after 45 minutes and tomorrow i shall throw it in the bin,0
this is one of the most calming relaxing and beautifully made animation films i've ever seen with beautiful music throughout the movie the sounds and music can make you feel like you're in the movie this movie is not just great for kids but adults too it teaches you lessons such as never forget who you are you can do whatever you stick your mind to and to brave and daring this movie can make you cry at times too which is always a nice touch in movies this movie is funny sad cute and keeps you on the edge of your seat some movies really give you a fuzzy feeling after you see them and the movie spirit is definitely one of them with my vote of 9 10 stars for animation music and a wonderful idea for a movie it gave me a whole lot of spirit,1
i rented this film purely on the fact that the cover appealed to me however as soon as the film began i had regrets it seems they used a home video camera to shoot this film and let a young child do it they also used inappropriate ghostly faces and shapes to try and scare people but i found myself laughing i could have put that together myself and done a better job of it br br as for the plot i felt that it had some really good ideas but because of dodgy lines and in some cases acting they were overshadowed it had no direction br br i didn't want to sit through it all because it caused me physical pain to watch it but i always finish what i start so i took a deep breath and let it carry on definitely 98minutes of my life wasted br br i would save yourself the embarrassment of knowing that you have watched 'haunted boat' and find something that is more entertaining i'm a fan of low budget horror films but this was a major disappointment i thought nothing could get worse after 'terror toons' but this made me reconsider a let down to its genre br br out of the star is for the ideas of having their worst fears coming for them,0
now for the truth its very very weak storyline for a walt disney film its total rubbish when the robinson appear the films all over the place i was shocked how poor it was it like alice in wonderland gone wrong it feels like they were short on ideas some mashed some crazy rubbish together to try and get away with it and they don't after that i sat there wishing for the end my younger brother lost interest half way through and was confused by the story the characters are weak and after the robinsons appear you don't care about the ending you just want the film to finish its a film to forget and forget quickly if you've got some spare time don't waste it on this,0
becky harris plays the female shopper whose misfortune it is to be in the store at the wrong time and obviously only purpose to be in this film is to supply a reason to wear out remote controls miss harris seems to me to be in her fifties or older when she first comes on the scene once the red haired thug is done with her it becomes apparent that this is no aarp queen if these are not some of the finest assets ever displayed on celluloid i want someone to clue me in absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and i literally wore out my vhs copy capturing her charms i would like to know if this movie is available on dvd br br the rest of this movie really is not worthy of mention i was hoping to see something fairly convincing and intelligent however i was disappointed on both counts god bless becky harris,0
a propaganda film for the palestinian cause if you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the israeli palestinian conflict you will need to look elsewhere if you are an anti semite or merely an anti zionist nothing wrong with advocating the destruction of a country right or uncritically in support of palestinian goals e g mass murder the destruction of israel this is the documentary for you should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the uk and us however any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged at the sheer number of lies presented in this video i just hope those who truly are unaware of the situation aren't corrupted by this anti semitic filth,0
this is the absolutely worst piece of crap i've ever had to watch actually it was so bad that i just had to watch it br br the cgi is sooo bad it's fun it's not even close to the shitty cgi animations in spawn that's how bad it is har har har br br i'm amazed over the fact that some distribution company actually has put money down to release this on dvd but i guess they'll get more money out of it that way 'cos the cost of making it can not have been more than a few hundred dollars br br it's so awful that a kindergarten class could have made it br br see it and laugh,0
bernard rapp passed away last year and was a very cultured journalist cinema was one of his biggest passions he penned a vast worldwide dictionary of films and so he was bound to wield a camera at least one time in his life but the films he left garnered lukewarm reviews tiré à part 1996 in spite of terence stamp's sensational performance was very caricatured in the depiction of the characters une affaire de goût 2000 was a slick affair even if bernard giraudeau delivered a perverse performance pas si grave 2003 was another let down and un petit jeu sans conséquence is as underwhelming as its predecessors its comic potential is exploited in a flimsy way br br and however the starting idea let predict a twirling spiritual comedy a couple held by yvan attal and sandrine kiberlain who invited their friends is in full moving in a lascivious mansion to play with their guests they pretend to part company with each other and things don't go as planned because the announcement of their separation doesn't surprise them the two lovers start to ponder about the validity of their couple br br in spite of lush scenery and the promising material he had at his disposal rapp's undistinguished directing can't manage to give life to this game with unexpected consequences the plot follows a well worn pattern with characters who have specific well known functions and masks that are unveiled about who they really are verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat a bad editing fades a little more the film with this bad habit from rapp to abruptly cut many sequences even the actors' sincere input in the venture is debatable they seem to be bored and to recite their texts than to live them especially sandrine kiberlain the audience is soon caught in a deep torpor br br it's regrettable to say it bernard rapp's films never lived up to his intentions as un petit jeu sans conséquence bears witness,0
my comment would have been added to the release date section but i couldn't find a place for it i was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the u s in feb 1955 i saw it in a first run theater in washington d c in march 1958 wonder if it was re released or some problem in my opinion this movie is very light entertainment but has some classic characters john mcintyre does a bang up job as a corrupt judge entrepreneur thief walter brennan does basically the same role he did in red river years earlier and in my opinion james stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did i have seen this movie a half dozen times or more and never tire of seeing parts of it again the photography and scenery are splendid and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty six minutes,1
if bob ludlum was to see this mini series he would have cried this was complete waste of time and money i have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be cbs wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was ludlum's work br br may be the creator should check out the bourne identity with richard chamberlain and see how good that tv series was br br poor mira blair anjelica and colm why did they sign to stoop this low br br horrible,0
most folks might say that if one were to spend a saturday night watching a movie you must be really bored actually i had just gotten back home from being out and turned on the tv and there it was paulie br br i had missed the opening credits so i didn't know the name of it but i saw that it had cheech marin in it so i naturally thought i had tuned into born in east l a when i saw him talking to a talking parrot i was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late in the night br br happy to say it was better than that as you know if you don't already paulie is lost and trying to get back to his original owner seems it's taken years to find her what should be paulie's advantage is actually a dis advantage in ways people come across a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves br br while cheech marin's character is making money from him he's not mean to him the dance sequences with the parrots are something kids will find cute i found them amusing br br paulie who's naive' learns quickly that not all humans are nice people especially the owner of an animal research lab the man lies to him saying he'll help him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal communications research paulie is now stuck but decides to make a fool out of the man at a demonstration to others of paulie's vocal ability br br throughout the film paulie's telling his story to the facilities janitor who ends up freeing him several other animals and finding the location of paulie's owner it's a touching reunion br br 8 out of 10 the wing clipping scene should have been assumed and not shown that part might bother younger children otherwise it's a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart end,1
may contain spoilers br br if living on tokyo time were some bold experiment where real life wanna be actors were given film parts on the condition that they would be required to take a combination of powerful prescription anti anxiety anti depression and anti psychotic medications this is the classic psych ward combo that renders patients into drooling zombies all during filming then this movie would hold far more interest or if the film production was another type of experiment where all of the actors were sleep deprived before and during filming then tokyo time could be more easily explained br br as it is this film is filled with lifeless low energy actors in the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking with his sister it appeared that he was having trouble keeping his eyes open in almost every scene he speaks his lines sitting down with every part of his body motionless from beginning to end his facial expression is best described as near sleep br br fret not about the actors speaking over each other's lines because these actors can barely finish droning out any lines of dialog everyone speaks with a depressing monotone voice no laughing no yelling no vigor no one has energy enough to crack a smile the result complete and total boredom br br and it does not help matters that the direction is simple and amateurish br br avoid this lifeless film at all costs better to watch greencard which has a similar plot and has charm and energy or for an unconventional japanese romance story check out the long vacation which has an ample amount of everything living on tokyo time does not,0
this is a well made informative film in the vein of pbs frontline the problem is frontline already did this piece and managed to bring l paul bremer in to tell his side of the story more troubling is the fact that the director of the film charles ferguson a former think tank wonk was a war supporter until the occupation went south what did he think would happen br br the invasion of poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky nazis and that is what this film feels like an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself br br ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run better as if any war can be better,0
this is a cgi animated film based upon a french 2d animated series the series ran briefly on cartoon network but its run was so brief that its inclusion as one of the potential oscar nominees for best animated film for this year left most people i know going huh this is the story of lian chu the kind heart muscle and gwizdo the brains of the operation who along with hector their fire farting dragon he's more like a dog travel the world offering up their services as dragon hunters but never getting paid into their lives comes zoe the fairy tale loving niece of a king who is going blind it seems the world is being devoured by a huge monster and all of the knights the king has sent out have never returned or if the do return they come back as ashes in desperation the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world eater zoe of course tags along br br what can i say other then why is this film hiding under a rock this is a really good little film that is completely off the radar except as unlikely oscar contender its a beautifully designed fantastic looking film the world it takes place has floating lands and crazy creatures that constantly had me going wow at it the english voice cast with forrest whitaker as lian chu one of the best vocal performances i've ever heard and rob paulson as gwizdo think steve bucsemi is first rate equally great is the script which doesn't talk down to its audience using some real expressions not normally heard in animated films not disney nor pixar its all really well done br br is it perfect no some of the bits go on too long but at the same time its is damn entertaining br br if you get the chance see this its one of the better animated films from 2008 and is going on my nice surprise list for 2009,1
quite unimpressive the 'twists' are all pretty predictable if you've seen any movies within the last ten years and the few somewhat interesting parts wherein someone utilizes context clues to make a decision are few and lack much punch since the 'secret' has already been shown before these clues are explained br br spoilers sorta br br the acting is decent enough the story simply isn't very interesting the whole 'still awake' premise becomes nullified by the astral projection stuff not kidding br br the surgery scene is initially tense a bit discomforting but then becomes utterly banal br br not horrible but not memorable terrence howard's least interesting role to date so far as i've seen br br kind of boring overall,0
perhaps the worst thing about carlos mencia's comedy is that every joke needs to be followed with an insult at the people in the crowd that aren't laughing if there's anybody who's insecure it's a comedian who won't shut up about his audience br br then again perhaps the worst thing about carlos mencia's comedy is that he doesn't get off his free speech high horse if you want to be funny just make a joke don't explain all the reasons why you're saving the american way with your failed attempts at generating laughter br br hmm actually the worst thing about carlos mencia's comedy is that it substitues meanspirited jabs at ethnicities for legitimate humor avoid this like the plague,0
because if i was i may have wished it was me being crucified on a wooden cross i'm still trying to determine the plot of this movie and i'm being generous that there was even a plot to begin with as previously mentioned it's a misnomer on the cover of the dvd that richard dreyfuss is actually the star he was barely in the movie and if he was indeed frustrated as the back cover indicated he was well that's probably because he said yes to be in this disaster of a movie and couldn't get out of it the movie really seemed to focus on jared martin and what his role in the movie was supposed to be other than the extreme close ups was not as big of a mystery as to what gene barry's role actually was or wasn't and speaking of big whomever had the bright idea to fit gene barry in the humpty dumpty attire which showcased his trousers literally pulled up to his chin should be sentenced to hard time by watching this movie stoned sober i could go on and on about how horrendous this movie was from the dialogue not matching the actors' mouths think clutch cargo to the erratic jumping from scene to scene again being generous even calling the frames of pictures scenes to the lack of a plot however if you're into bad early 70s genre and if you're in a cottage in michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of kid cat pictures i recommend having a good bottle of wine before you embark on this weird ride of a movie because you'll be thankful that you may not remember it the next day,0
well this movie is amazingly awful i felt sorry for the actors involved in this project because i'm sure they did not write their lines which were sometimes delivered with slight sarcasm which lead me to believe they were not taking this movie seriously nor could anybody who watches this obnoxious off beat monster slasher while watching this creature unknown i could not help but think that there was not much of a budget or a competent writer on the crew but if you go into watching this for a laugh you'll be happy the movie is shameless to mocking itself because i cant see how anybody could look at this and be proud of pumping this straight to dvd clichéd wanna be action thriller horror movie fightfest to light,0
as a veteran of many many pretentious french films i thought i'd taken the worst the industry had to offer and was able to stomach anything but not this pointless relentless violent unpleasant meaningless the film has nothing to offer and is random hatred and aggression dressed up as pretentious art avoid at all costs,0
if another hitler ever arises it will be thanks in part to nonsense like this film which propagates the absurd notion that he was a visibly deranged lunatic from the start far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office in the land sane people would cross the street to avoid him and he would have died in a ditch nameless and unknown br br anyone who reads the accounts of hitler's close companions the autobiography of his secretary traudl junge for instance will be struck by the fact that people found him a kindly intelligent generous man he was also a brilliant orator and the fact that his speeches seem overblown and ranting to modern ears ignores the times in which they were made when strutting pomposity was common in political speeches ditto the overstated anti semitism which was neither a central plank of the early nazis who were primarily anti communist nor uncommon or unusual for the times the film makes it look as though hitler's sole ambition from the start was the holocaust br br if you want to identify the next person who will cause the death of tens of millions you can ignore fleck lipped ravers life the one portrayed here look instead for a charming charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country i'm afraid his personality will be much more like barack obama's than fred phelps' br br i hoped for much here and got nothing but caricature the fools who made this thing perpetrated a crime against reality this is the historical equivalent of 'reefer madness',0
this is my favorite all time movie it used to be my friday night movie with a pizza and bottle of wine when i was single i first saw this movie with my aunt brend and sister chasity i was in the 2nd grade i fell in love with travolta and sissy was my new best friend i've read a lot of comments about why bud left sissy how sissy has to learn to act married but let's go back and look at this for a second spoiler my interpretation of the movie now not when i was eight is this about bud sissy's relationship takes a turn for the worst because she makes a fool of him at gilley's riding the bull they get in a huge fight bud tries to make sissy jealous by asking pam to dance sissy then thinks two wrongs will make a right and wes asks her if she needs any help they're all on the dance floor acting like fools when bud asks pam when are you going to take me home and rape me pam answers when ever you're ready cowboy bud then goes home with pam to her condo in downtown houston which daddy has bought for her with his oil money and all that that implies bud is the one who cheats on sissy sissy is waiting for bud when he returns home the next day sissy is the one who leaves bud then it's up to bud to prove to sissy that he is a real cowboy and win her back br br anyways that's my interpretation everyone has their i'm sure i love this movie br br and believe it or not i got myself a real cowboy i love him too,1
this is a movie i had never even thought of seeing until my 3 year old spotted it at the video store and grabbed it after liking the cover picture of the animals on nabooboo island we got it and have watched it repeatedly since in fact we've rented it several times since there are very few non animated movies that my son will watch and pay attention to what a nice change from dumbo and the little mermaid the acting is outstanding the songs are compelling they get deep into your head and you can't help but singing along the storyline while specifically about ww2 is timeless in it's own way and there is something new to see every time you watch i've heard it compared to mary poppins but i think they are two very different movies both excellent but somehow my son has no interest at all in mary poppins this is one of those movies that kids will want to watch over and over again and one that parents won't mind complying with there are days we watch it before nap time and bed time and i don't feel that groan coming that comes when he wants to repeat any other movie,1
this is the worst adaption of a classic story i have ever seen they needlessly modernize it and some points are actually just sick br br the songs rarely move along the story they seem to be thrown in at random the flying scene with marley is pointless and ludicrous br br it's not only one of the worst movies i've seen but it is definitely the worst musical i've ever seen br br it's probably only considered a classic because a christmas carol is such a classic story just because the original story was a classic doesn't mean that some cheap adaption is,0
according to john ford's lyrically shot fictional biopic of abraham lincoln's life his greatest faults may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in the worst way ford's camera has only praising views to reveal of mr lincoln's early life but for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early film what could have been a series of gorgeous still frames ford has a unique eye for telling a story the film sings of the life of a hopeful young man henry fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever lincoln to a tee one of his best roles br br the film concerns two young men brothers on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed in classic angry mob style the town decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the pair of them until honest abe steps into the fray he charms them with his humor telling them not to rob him of his first big case and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boys lawyer what follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom murder dramas thereafter as abe cunningly interrogates witnesses to the delight and humor of the judge jury and town before he stumbles upon the missing links br br the film plays out like many john ford movies do a tablespoon of americana a dash of moderate predictability a hint of sarcasm that you aren't sure if you put in the recipe or if ford did it himself despite the overtly 'hollywood' feel of the film and overly patriotic banter alluding to lincoln's future presidency the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed if you can take your drama with a grain of salt,1
and i mean ultra light this film features four giant stars about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that br br there really isn't too much to say about this stinker other than that although it has a couple of really good bits most of it isn't very funny nor does it work at all as a romance how about as a romantic comedy not on your life most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated much less amusing br br what's really ashame is the premise is not bad at all this movie could have been so much more especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted complete with phony quotes from critics the film uncovers the un mined territory of the press junket those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews but instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film's lame romance br br the same with catherine zeta jones' character the whinny self centered movie star zeta jones does a good job with what she's given but she's given practically nothing it's all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we've heard about stars over the years br br in the end it is hard to understand what made zeta jones julia roberts john cusack and billy crystal sign aboard this doomed ship which sinks like a rerun of the love boat in fact as the old joke goes they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal it would probably make a better story so go ahead and tell us filmmakers what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this,0
this cartoon is short on plot but is a visually stunning piece of work there will be very very minor spoilers br br this short has a story that's incredibly slight gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs that's pretty much the plot such as it is but this cartoon isn't about the plot it's about the color and animation the visuals are exceptional back in 1936 such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly inspired work here br br my favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes at more than one point there are a series of pipes aligned in a row from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ br br the visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed these types of shorts were things which hugh harman and rudolf ising are noted for but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from mgm because this cartoon probably went over budget and mgm finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than harman and ising were br br this is truly a beautiful cartoon and is well worth seeing it's available on the dvd attack of the '30s characters recommended particularly if you like good animation,1
follow up to 1973's walking tall continues the real life drama surrounding tennessee sheriff buford pusser but this installment plays like a lame tv movie bo svenson takes over the lead role from joe don baker but he's much too mild for the part he comes off like an ambling country singer with a bat instead of a guitar good supporting actors like richard jaekel luke askew and robert doqui end up with very little to do i would give the film one star strictly on its good intentions but the screenplay is a transparent and lazy mass of routine predicaments and the production is cheapjack followed in 1977 by final chapter walking tall and in 1978 by the television film a real american hero,0
the crush is a pleasant enough 40 something friends romantic chick flick for the first two thirds or so as it tries to be a brit sex and the city br br i particularly enjoyed the turn around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out come to think of it we didn't see all that much physical flesh of him either and kenny doughty is worth seeing more of br br they sure make a lot more deal of young man older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of sabrina neither movie do i like or for that matter with the douglas zeta jones or dion svengali nuptials br br surrounding andie macdowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from brit dramas and comedies such as tart tongued anna chancellor br br the plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina but it wasn't until the credits came up at the end that i realized what might really be wrong just as with sex and the city the writer director is male here first timer scot john mckay and i think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work the characters are a school principal a cop and a doctor which would have been a better and more interesting movie the working title for the film was the sad f cker's club which would have made its parallels with the gay broken hearts club even more obvious br br originally written 4 6 2002,0

interesting film about an actual event that took place during the civil war in vermont it kept my attention to the end and i don't regret viewing it i haven't ever read any on this raid incident so i was curious to see if the rebels pulled it off i enjoy historical films from that era br br my major complaint is with the confederate uniforms they look too good the acting was a little stiff at times i like the old man eating the mashed potatoes because he didn't have any teeth the wounded soldier playing fetch with a hound was a little strange overall it was a descent film,0
wow this movie bored the pants off me when i saw it bland pointless and unmoving br br apparently ash and co can travel through time with the help of the spirit of the forest 'princess mononoke' much there they meet a dorky kid named sam and the plot begins br br so tom ash and huck sam get high with nature become hippies and try to free celebi the spirit from some weirdo hunter guy i don't even know what else went on it all went by in a blur ash's friends were hardly in it and all the fight scenes were boring br br after saving the day ash and his infamous friends must return to their time while watching sam float away with celebi that scene was just creepy o o then after returning to their time ash learns that his new friend is actually his rival's grandpa and i think that's it pretty retarded isn't it if you love your children you won't expose them to this 1 out of 10,0
what's wrong with this film many many things the editing tries too hard to look good and does nothing but confuse the viewer whilst also supplying him her with a powerful headache the plot is muddled and obviously prolonged from what started as a short story or film the plot only makes for less than ten minutes of good story and this is just stretched out painfully until it reached the minimum length for a feature film we all know what happens to things when we stretch them right exactly they get thinner in the end the plot is just so paper thin that you might even miss it if you aren't paying attention which is hard to do when watching this movie the acting is not even slightly impressive the characters are poorly written and dull uninteresting one of the worst things that are wrong with this film is that apparently whoever was in charge of the score soundtrack had no idea what the movie was or what it was supposed to be about not that i blame him i couldn't figure it out either as a result half of the music in the film doesn't fit the scenes at all also what was with all the sexual undertones between eliza dushku and the main character naturally this was in order to attract young males but it was just so cheaply done and did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film on any conceivable level at all the two creepy guys didn't seem to have anything to do with the film at all they were just there in order to have some chase scenes i doubt anyone would really enjoy a film so poorly put together and such a shameless and awful hollywood like attempt at a somewhat interesting idea but i digress i recommend this to teenagers with low attention spans who don't mind a really bad horror thriller as long as there's some sex and gore in it although that may only be true for the killer cut which i saw 1 10,0
this rubbish excuse for television is the single most god awful piece of trash ever to hit australian television the house mates are dull uninteresting ridiculously unintelligent and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them as far as i am concerned big brother is the decline of western society showing how us as a society are on a steep slope to becoming brain dead morons whatever happened to television that didn't target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience this cannot be classified as entertainment i think that it true that channel ten can remove your soul it happened to rove mcmanus who was once a respectable comedian and once moving to channel 10 become horribly unfunny with the exception of the simpsons which is highly intelligently made,0
this film is fantastic as it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way a child would for adults the idea of a child's drawings becoming a place she can physically visit and have influence over is wonderful at the same time you could get all child psychologist about it and say she's really exploring her subconscious just as we all do in our dreams when we sleep the bit that gives me goose pimples is when her dad is in the paper house and chases her the only thing i can't stand is that it was marketed as a horror film it really isn't if you want to see something british with plenty of storyline which keeps you guessing without the usual cheap thrills most films have to use then watch paperhouse,1
this isn't 'bonnie and clyde' or 'thelma and louise' but it is a fine road movie it sets up its two main characters gently and easily viewers learn the underlying tensions quickly which is a tribute to the director there is the young french and english speaking son who wants to do well in france has a french girlfriend and who drinks alcohol parties as young men do and there is his moroccan arabic and french speaking father who devoutly follows his muslim faith with generosity and the wisdom of elders and who rejects the new culture surrounding him like mobile phones the film could explore very powerful politics the odd couple drive thru the former yugoslavia thru turkey and then thru the middle east to get to mecca these are areas where the muslim populations have been involved in wars repression ethnic cleansing where dictators have pursued torture and summary executions to hold power and where religious communities are in constant deadly battle with each other yet the film moves thru those places and possibilities with only hints of such agendas the relationship between the two is key to this film and faith politics are the backdrop it seems to be saying that we are all human and need to understand and care for each other in order to manage well in this world it certainly isn't 'natural born killers' and is all the better for it,1
we do not come across movies on brother sister relationship in indian cinema or any other language or medium this relationship has several aspects which have not been exploited in movies or novels typically a sister is depicted as a pile on who can be used for ransom in the climax this movie treats the subject in an entirely different light br br it is inspired by george eliot's novel the mill on the floss the brother is very prosaic all good the blue eyed boy who is a conventionally good son and a favorite with his mother the sister is romantic wild and defiant of the unwritten rules of the society in spite of this the love of the brother sister is the winner br br this movie is about the love of the two siblings who are separated in childhood and revival of the same feeling when they meet years later it is also the quest of the subdued brother to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be wild to defy the world br br although the movie and the novel are set about 3 centuries apart in two distant countries yet the sentiments are the same and still hold true,1
i didn't feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless br br it is original although reminded me a little of two other french films vidocq and city of lost children mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters br br set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbuster br br always interesting with the perennial 'black arts' well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable br br scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing,1
after 7 years of watching that dreadful nonsense called star trek voyager i was feeling pretty numb next gen and ds9 were bloody good stuff and voyager ruined tv trek this opened with probably the best pilot to a trek show the crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts scott bakula played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything captains from before the rest of the crew were really likable in their roles and i think they got off to a good first season when the show was prematurely canceled i was really disappointed in a mirror darkly showed us what the cast were capable of pity a film or tv movie was never considered so much back story and founding of the federation left to tell including the onset of hostilities with the klingons,1
dick clement and ian la frenais have a solid hit rate as far as their tv work is concerned however their film work has been much more chequered 2008's the bank job was fine the previous year's across the universe decidedly weak for instance br br still crazy fortunately is a solid success it has a great story excellent performances a lot of humour fabulous music and above everything else real heart br br i savour moments and this film has one of them just when everything is going pear shaped at the festival reunion performance br br hugely enjoyable,1
i'm glad i rented this movie for one reason its shortcomings made me want to read allende's book and get the full story br br pros the movie is beautiful the period is depicted well and consistently to the best of my knowledge and meryl and glenn do good jobs br br cons this is the worst acting job i've ever seen from jeremy irons i kept wondering if something was wrong with his mouth and i hate the terribly english way he says transito winona ryder does nothing believable except look young and idealistic most of the other performances are ok but so few things hang together in the character arcs and the relationship development that i was frustrated and angry well before the end br br i'm very curious now whether this movie is typical of bille august's work i may have to drop another couple of bucks to rent smilla's sense of snow,0
they're not jawing journalists cary grant and rosalind russell from his girl friday or witty detective william powell and sassy lady myrna loy from thin man but woody allen and scarlett johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur sleuths in scoop their screwball repartee is more postmodern than post depression allen's writing filled with ironic self deprecation and plain old new york angst shades of the old wit occur rarely such as when he as sid the great splendini magician responds about his background i was born into the hebrew persuasion but when i got older i converted to narcissism johansson fresh from allen's match point as a bad girl here gets to be a relatively good sometimes ditsy journalism student caught in a murder mystery suitable for london a serial killer the plot is a reworking of his recent london based thriller match point right down to the upper class sins and the american tragedy place in the sun boating accident as a matter of fact allen is reworking manhattan murder mystery and purple rose of cairo to name just a couple of other examples i care not if he reworks i would like the new material to be at least the equal of the originals and alas it is just a reflection of his younger greatness br br allen as director and actor can't hide his love for the actress as he couldn't for diane keaton and therefore takes a middling comedy into an appropriate place down the allen canon not great but amusing at times brilliantly satirical about the suspected upper class murderer sid allen quips i'd be very surprised if he killed one person this is vintage allen humor while there are barely any bright literary allusions as in most of his film he lards scoop with music from grieg tchaikovsky and strauss to let us know the woodman has not lost his touch of class,1
slashers 2 outta 5 stars br br not really a very good movie but i did like the idea behind it and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with the movie is ostensibly an episode of a live japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off danger zone and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them the survivor if there is one wins fame and fortune everyone else just winds up dead the main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad none of the real people seem real at all the actors playing the killers are kind of fun because they are portraying cheesy and over the top caricatures of popular modern horror movie types and that's exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show the movie pretends to be done all in one take there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the danger zone and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly to hide the cuts from one take to another i would imagine,0
i love the doodlebops my son has been watching them for over a year we went to the doodlebops concert last year as well as one concert yesterday connecticut he loves them the doodlebops do not teach the alphabet or numbers but who cares are you being serious the tv isn't suppose to teach your children about numbers or the alphabet the parents should get over it the doodlebops actually can sing deedee has a beautiful voice and in concert you can tell all 3 of them have nice singing voices and do not lip sing imagine they dance jump around and still sing they have talent the kids love them i even enjoy watching the show this show is by far the best show on tv for kids and a rock band for children how amazing is that why are people saying chad rooney is gay where did you hear that from whether he is or not he is awesome leave him alone its not like he or anyone else is promoting homosexuality to our children,1
america needs the best man possible to win the game so who do they hire a gymnast oh brother played by kurt thomas who has the necessary skills to win in a game which involves ninjas a village of crazies and richard norton who is told by kurt thomas to keep his hardware in his pants his exact words i missed this in theaters and it's a good reason because i would have probably been kicked out due to the laughing i broke into at regular intervals the first thing that went through my mind was just how lame these ninjas are if a gymnast can kick their ass kurt thomas is like 5 foot 4 and he hardly strikes one as the best man for the job as to the acting talent of kurt thomas well if you can't say something nice in all seriousness though one has to wonder how much cocaine was being used to furnish an idea so stupid only the decision to cast tara reid as a scientist tops the dumbness here for 18 years though this held the title of the dumbest movie i had ever seen not to say i didn't find this unwatchable i was laughing so hard i almost choked to death twice only in the 80's could a movie with such a bad idea get made although for the record it is the only movie to ever feature a hero so wimpy he can't even pull a wedged sword out from the ground this is the wimpiest action movie ever made and one of the most hilarious also br br out of 4 bad,0

the italian is an astonishingly accomplished film for its time stunningly shot with lighting effects that are truly sublime this is an early gem that clearly reveals reginald barker to be a pioneer director of equal standing to d w griffith and maurice tourneur how much control thomas ince exerted over the production is hard to know but this film still has extraordinary power the simple story of an italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in new york is very moving the themes of social injustice revenge and forgiveness are completely relevant today the use of close ups is outstanding and the powerhouse performance of george beban is electrifying what we need now is a really good print transferred to dvd so we can truly appreciate this early masterpiece of cinema,1
urgh 3 things a movie needs a good script a good plot and good casting i watched this movie expecting it to be hilariously terrible and was unfortunately disappointed when it was just plain terrible i lost the will to live halfway through the only thing which stopped me from stabbing my eyes out with a fork was rose byrne who was the reason for me watching it in the first place she did a good job as rastus and her appearance hasn't changed much since she was 13 it was a fantastic first effort in a movie the dog was also very good both did a great job with such awful material sandra bernhard i think was the biggest mistake of the movie she was completely miscast and i don't think she ever quite got the character br br i give the movie 2 out of 10 and thats only because of rose,0
this movie is excellent i found it very interesting i thought the wendigo legend was pretty cool the acting was also great as well as the costumes production photography directing and script br br a very happy family on vacation gets stranded in the middle of nowhere after they hit a deer a huntsman then appears and is very angry and outraged over the fact that one of the deer's antler's is broken he then starts to stalk the family and weird things start to happen to them br br see this movie it's worth it kudos to the cast crew and filmmakers two thumbs way up,1
richard dreyfuss stars in moon over parador a 1988 paul mazursky film also starring raul julia sonia braga jonathan winters and charo dreyfuss plays a new york actor jonathan nolan in the caribbean country of parador to make a film when the dictator dies suddenly the secret police chief julia who is the one actually controlling the dictator and the country drafts jonathan to play the dictator having noticed the resemblance between them soon jonathan is ensconced in the palace as alphonse simms and simms' prostitute girlfriend madonna braga who realizes the switch promises to help him in any way she can br br mazursky who appears in drag as simms' mother gives us a look at how the cia operates in third world countries the winters character supposedly a salesman is actually a cia operative the film however flirts with but doesn't really tread on very serious ground and is more of a send up and a funny one at that br br richard dreyfuss does a fabulous job as jonathan the actor and alphonse the dictator creating two separate characters and nailing both the gorgeous sonia braga is great as madonna and raul julia hands in a wickedly funny performance as strausmann the man behind the dictator it's one of those performances where you never quite know what the character is thinking he can be pleasant or turn psycho at any moment charo is on hand as a maid and manages to be funny and unobtrusive at the same time br br a very good film not a big blockbuster but very entertaining,1
this film really tries to hard if your going to make a horror film at least give it a reason to believe in to hook the viewer br br you wait and wait through the film expecting for some grand explanation but it doesn't instead it tries to be too clever ending and not revealing anything br br what was the point of the movie where it's actually going and more importantly what the hell was going on br br why were they there and how does it tie into anything just another weak sci fi horror i love the fake reviews on imdb saying how great it is by related press releases to bump the movie either that or people have low horizons it's not worth your 2hrs at all br br i'm not saying the film is better than the fragile but at least that gave you reasoning and why things happened and has an end result this doesn't and it just waffle's on with tons of padding to make everything feel scary this film is about as low as when a stranger calls god that was lame too br br big tip if your gonna make a horror make it believable with reasoning and explain to the viewer what's going on so they have a hook into your story because if there's no reasoning or believability then there's no firm hold on anything and it can't be scary no disrespect to the cast or crew cause they did a good job it's just the poor writing,0
for anyone who wishes to get an impression of the soviet view of modern russian history this monumental film is a treasure the story starts at the turn of the century 1900 in the yellowish sepia colours of old photographs which improves to black and white during the middle of the century and to full colour when the story approaches modern times i e the 1960s br br the story focuses on a boy in a remote siberian village who is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the czarist era he later joins the bolsheviks after the revolution and brings soviet communism to his village his son by the local beauty fights the germans during the second world war when he returns to the village the oil industry takes off and we are treated to some soviet economic idealism br br this film is long and slow but utterly logic and very well made it can be seen in three parts,1
when i saw the preview for this on tv i was thinking ok its gonna be a good werewolf movie but it was not it was not scary at all acting was good plot was horrible the military bid was just plain stupid i think the sci fi channel could of done better than this piece of crap the movie made it sound like arron was going to turn into a werewolf instead he turned psycho and bit some doctor's throat out if you have read some of my other reviews on other movies there all positive but this one is not simply because the story was terrible one out of 10 max im sure you all were expecting some werewolf flick but i bet you didn't expect this beyond loch nes was way better than this movie heck any movie thats on the sci fi channel is better than this movie,0
clark gable plays a con man who busts into the life of hard boiled dame jean harlow he tries to sucker her while she brushes him off with her tough gal attitude despite their cynicism and cons they fall in love when gable accidentally kills a man during a sting he runs out leaving loyal harlow to women's prison where she discovers she's pregnant anita loos' and howard emmett rogers' writing is excellent throughout with many well drawn and surprising characters including a jewish socialist woman inmate and a black woman inmate and her preacher father played with hardly a trace of stereotype gable and harlow show their mettle as actors adding telling nuances and quirks to their characters that send them beyond the typical gable and harlow roles and the direction is much better than you'd expect from sam wood one beautiful shot has harlow being inducted into the prison then led out into a surprisingly snowy courtyard as the camera tracks after her this is one of the best of both the criminals in love and women's prison genres and has some of the best hard boiled dialogue ever written,1
i loves this movie because it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved heath ledger and orlando bloom did a great job portraying ned and joe it has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that the language is very mild and sometimes don't even know it is there this movie shows that just because they are outlaws does not mean that they are vicious killers i hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one there is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ned looked at also that that is how people remember them from their armor i hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as i have,1
i had quite high hopes for this film even though it got a bad review in the paper i was extremely tolerant and sat through the entire film i felt quite sick by the end br br although i am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema i thouroughly enjoyed both woody allen's 'everything you ever wanted to know about sex ' and michael hanneke's 'funny games' i found the directors' obsession with this ten year old wanting to drink women's milk totally sickening and when the film climaxed in an orgy where the boy drinks both his mother's milk as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film i almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it is br br don't get me wrong i enjoy the vast majority of european cinema as well as independently made films so this flick should have pleased me enormously avoid this film at all costs it should be relegated to the annals of history as a lesson in bad cinema,0
ohhh the brutality ohhhhh the dying breed ohhhh the sense of loss ohhhh the prejudice jeez when are all you whiney revisionists going to stop analyzing westerns for crying out loud s t happens if it offends your socially engineered sensibilities then go back to the comfort of your meryl steep collection br br boring tedious and very tiresome waste of celluloid particularly in light of coburn hackman bergen's presence nothing interesting or intriguing here unless you are obsessed with 19th century desert dentisty may have been a little better without the constant diversion of the out of place mexican guy with the bad tooth a monument to the stupid ultra left creeping sensitivity of the 60 70's virtually impossible to sit through the entire film i think i'd rather have my eyes stapled open for the entire lucky luke trinity series 4 horses 10 all deader'n hell,0
the world of the dragon hunters is a 3d gravity challenged world planetoids bits of buildings and strange flat plants float around in the atmosphere while the ground towards most of the characters are falling is nowhere to be seen it is a world reminiscent of neverending story when the nothing came to eat the world away br br funny enough the villain here is the world gobbler as well this time it is a huge skeleton dragon with fiery eyes the heroes are a big yet taciturn warrior an annoying and greedy sidekick managing the entrepreneurial side of the duo and a strange useless animal they are joined by the most talkative little girl in the world who to my chagrin did not die a horrible painful and hopefully early death br br the animation is great the voices and the sounds are top notch too bad the story is as simple as one can possibly imagine they go to stop the world gobbler they reach him almost immediately they defeat him the end no real character development or story twists not even the ones i would expect from a movie with such a plot br br bottom line it's a cute thing to watch kids would probably enjoy it but that's about it no depth to this world pun intended,1
i found the one and only comment about this movie entirely uninformative and altogether too harsh so i have decided to write my own i first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then first of all let me say that overall the things that this movie gets right are what make it worthwhile it doesn't matter that it has some low budget quirks and other faults it is worth watching the idea of basing a movie on walt whitman's visit a restrictive narrow minded anglo canadian community in southern ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis en scene the movie is about the kind of humanizing catalysis whitman inspired in people and in that sense it is exactly accurate the acting especially by rip torn whitman and colm feore as the doctor is very good the scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time overall what's not to like besides name another film in which whitman is brought so vividly to life,1
for a while i was caught in the trap where i found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that i liked them fatty drives the bus is the exception it is the truth it is the best bad movie ever br br the badness of this movie seems to come naturally halfway through satan's opening monologue the word hell appears at the bottom of the screen the glamorous bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and a thrift store dress it takes the eccentric couple that keeps trying to kill each other forever to walk down the stairs jesus walks to a funk soundtrack br br anyways fatty gives the impression that someone lost their tenure for advising a senior's film project but it's the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful you get the impression the makers knew it was going to be bad but never forced it br br never to be duplicated in wonder fatty delivers highly highly recommended,1
this is a good film for 99 of the duration i feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaim br br it is shot in a rather naive fashion this is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming technique br br the gruesome characters are very well acted and presented especially the 'nutcase' called joe however the wholesome normal characters are a little too pathetic for my liking granted they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little ott br br the film starts slowly and the naive camera work smacks of 'b' movie to start with and very normally but you soon get a feel of the impending brutality that is about to occur this is one of the most 'twisted' movies with respect to cold hearted violence br br after the abrupt and unbelievably lazy ending i was left feeling disappointed i would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in keeping with the rest of the film but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength of the 'eeriness' and nail biting scenes earlier on in the film br br give it a watch and excuse the ending,1
family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about one man daddy has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity the kids grow up one all be it in the hard way to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances yes i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent this true to life is one which every young adult and parent would do well to see although some will not realize it until they too are parents a must see for those who care about their families,1
i saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight i absolutely loved it the movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night cillian murphy is extremely creepy as the villain for those of you who have seen batman begins his character was much scarier in this film he played his character very well the scariest bad guy i have seen in awhile rachel mcadams was great everyone in the audience laughed gasped and cheered at the same time as if we were on cue the suspense is held through out the movie the amazing part is that the end was not anti climatic i was not disappointed in the end i felt satisfied the trailer does not do the movie justice the movie is much better than the trailer indicated do not wait for this movie to come out on video go see it although i did not have to pay to see this movie i would have gladly given 10 75 to see it enjoy,1
if you like a syfi soap opera this show is for you as fare as i am concerned it does not work for me and after watching 3 episodes i just can't watch it anymore it is boring and slow and for a show that the timeline is based around 100 000 years ago if you base it on battlestar galactica's timeline for arriving on earth they sure seem to have all the same stuff around like the 100 000 year old chevy vans driving down the streets and people watching the 100 000 year old popular name brand lcd t v sets it also goes the same with the rest of the sets as well on the show there is just to much of today's stuff involved in it to not overlook i think they could have done a lot better of a job to get around these issues and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same issues but not nearly as bad as fare as the rest of the show it is not nearly as good as bsg was and it is a poor pre sequel to it,0
if you want to see intelligent philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential watch waking life which is brilliant what the do we know is all over the place in its focus poorly directed poorly written poorly acted utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying it wasn't thought provoking or entertaining in the slightest the inclusion of that rambling freak ramtha in this film is reason enough to avoid it isn't it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some 2 000 year old atlantian god or something what a flake that old chick is and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was the people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again,0
ron howard directed this the 1966 cartoon is charming teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot in this movie howard gives us a whoville filled with greedy manipulative self centered whos jim carrey is terrible but i'm sure it's not his fault i imagine the script called for the nastiest person imaginable so carrey channeled tom green and the result is movie magic much like danny devito's penguin in batman returns carrey's grinch is so thoroughly unlikeable that any degree of comedy that might be mined from his character simply evaporates where the 1966 cartoon featured a grinch that we could all identify with carrey's grinch is that angry soulless old man that we've all seen at one time or another sitting in a parked car muttering to himself or tripping toddlers at the supermarket with his cane this grinch is thoroughly bereft of any degree of humanity humor or insight whatsoever and his redemption at the end of the movie rings false the whole movie rings false there is some stupid christmas lighting competition a failed attempt at explaining why the grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood and an indecipherable mystery as to why some of the whos have that weird lip extension and some of them don't contrary to the 1966 cartoon i would imagine children would find this movie tiresome irritating and filled with contradictory messages did we really need to see slutty smurf aka christine baranski as martha may whovier in addition ron howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives throw in the requisite butt jokes fart jokes sex jokes and other obligatory carreyesque low brow humor and you have a movie that is about as far from the 1966 cartoon or book that inspired it as george w bush is from rational lucid thought thumbs down on this big fat turkey,0
de vierde man the fourth man 1984 is considered one of the best european pycho thrillers of the eighties this last work of dutch director paul verhoeven in his home country before he moved to hollywood to become a big star with movies like total recall basic instinct and starship troopers is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author jeroen krabbe going to the seaside for recovering there he meets a mysterious femme fatale renee soultendieck and starts a fatal love affair with her he becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three previous husbands all died with mysterious circumstances br br de vierde man is much influenced by the old hollywood film noire and the psycho thrillers of alfred hitchcock and orson wells it takes much time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact to push the story straight forward the suspense is sometimes nearly unbearable and sometimes reminds of the works of italian cult director dario argento br br the cast is also outstanding especially krabbe's performance as mentally disturbed writer that opened the doors for his international film career the living daylights the fugitive if you get the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on tv video or dvd don't miss it,1
as far as i know this show was never repeated on uk television after its original run in the late '60s early '70s and most episodes are now sadly missing presumed wiped br br series 6 from 1971 however still exists in its entirety and i recently got the chance to watch it all the best part of 4 decades on br br after rushing home from school freewheelers was essential viewing for me and many of my contemporaries back in those halcyon days of flared trousers slade and chicory tip and watching it again brought a nostalgic lump to the throat br br never mind the bad hammy acting the unintentionally amusing fight scenes plot holes wide enough to pilot a large ocean going yacht through and the frightfully frightfully rada accents of the lead players br br no forget all that because freewheelers harks back to a bygone dare i say golden age of kids' tv drama when the shows were simply about rip roaring fun and didn't take themselves so seriously before they became obsessed with all the angst laden ishoos that today's screenwriters have their young protagonists fret over such as relationships pregnancy drugs stis etc br br no doubt if it were remade for a modern audience in these days of all pervasive political correctness the boss figure would be a black female one of the young male heroes would be a muslim the other would be a white lad confused about his sexuality and the girl would be an all action go getter with an iq off the scale who'd be forever getting the lads out of scrapes and making them look foolish in other words a million miles removed from wendy padbury's deferential ankle spraining washer upper br br it's a show that's very much of its time but is that a bad thing i for one don't think so,1
nb spoiler warning such as it is br br first off this is a teen slasher flick the spam in a cabin genre as joe bob briggs piquantly put it if you're looking for roshambo this isn't it and wasn't going to be it i'm desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography directing or acting performances br br secondly this wasn't zuniga's first horror flick it was her first screen appearance period cinema tv whatever for what it is worth neither is daphne zuniga susan sarandon or katherine hepburn br br thirdly you have to give even a lame slasher flick props sure it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre any young woman having or showing interest in sex is beef on the hoof and the harvest time is now br br except this one gives the chop to the sweet virginal protagonist as well now there is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions interesting that this was said ingenue's only film role another one hit wonder except that term gives the lass too much credit br br then again this film probably has one of the highest percentage of one movie actors in history of the nineteen credited actors a whopping thirteen never appeared in any other film three appeared in one other movie by the same producers only one other besides zuniga has as many as six screen credits what was this the has been and never were mutual aid society br br granted i saw this a long time ago on late night cable when i was bored and never anticipate being that bored in my life again but i see no reason to hunt down everyone involved and toss them in the incinerator with joanne br br 2 10,0
fragglerock is excellent in the way that schindler's list was excellent a great watch for children and adults of all genders big noses can be seen as hinting towards phallic symbols in the same way that h r puff n stuff had hinted towards marijuana smoking your kids will love this movie i enjoyed it very much as a child my father showed me this movie as a child he enjoyed it as well and pointed out that the exaggerated noses were phallic symbols although at the time i had no clue about what those were the movie is comedy and adventure the storyline is wacky and cheerful i and you shall enjoy this together,1
my 3rd year french classes always enjoyed this film very much in a multi cultural inner city high school the film provided many subjects for discussion in french in class but i know a lot of discussion went on in english after class the most obvious is the relationship between protée and aimée compared to the one between protée and france br br i always mentioned that i felt this film had one of the sexiest scenes i had ever seen in a movie one year a 17 year old african american shouted yes when he figured out the scene the one where protée is helping aimée lace up her evening dress all the while both are examining the reflection of the other in the mirror directors use the mirror technique when then want to focus on the inner conflict on the part of one or more character in a scene this is a perfect example of the technique and it is sexy br br most students had trouble understanding the end of the film one suggested that one theme of the movie was africanism and that no matter how much one loved africa or africans one cannot become african like the driver tried to do one must be african,1
falsely accused skirt chasing chums john wayne as john scott and eddy chandler as kansas charlie change identities to become alias smith and jones mr wayne becomes john jones mr chandler's is supposed to be rev smith but wayne calls him dr smith at no time are either of them as entertaining as roger davis pete duel jonathan harris or ben murphy although wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them career wise pretty blonde mary kornman as anne grown up from her days in our gang is a lovely interest for wayne she and chandler have a couple of cute scenes with wayne if you're not a fan of low budget john wayne films of the 1930s this movie won't make you one,0
firstly i am not easily scared by anything except for my few phobias but this movie is absolutely horrific this is not appropriate for children at all i had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me i couldn't believe how gory it was for a children's movie bunnies being brutally murdered it's just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated g i recommend being over 8 to see this but don't get me wrong it was probably a good movie if i wasn't scarred mentally as a child i cannot believe a parent would allow a let's say 4 year old child to watch this it's just to intense and complicated not to forget gory for young kids i'm wayy over 4 and i was shocked by the violence i don't recommend,0
don't waste your time on this film it could have been good but the ending was one of the lamest i've ever seen i seriously have to wonder how the people involved with the making of this film could've looked at that final scene and thought yeah now there's an ending and patted themselves on the back about it to me it seemed more like they just ran out of ideas they built up the final scenes to have a cool twist but instead just let the whole build up fall flat on it's face when the last shot faded to black and i heard the credit music starting i was in shock i could not believe what i was seeing and that someone could even call that an ending the best thing anyone could do with this film is rewrite the end and give it some substance seriously i'd really love to get whoever came up with that one in a room look them in the face and say wtf,0
i loved it fred macmurray is wonderful as skid johnson a somewhat conceited proud yet at the same time very vulnerable saxophone player who is in love with maggie carole lombard who's always there for him they meet in panama after maggie comes off a ship and end up in a bar with anthony quinn tony gets punched in the nose after her insults maggie by thinking her a loose woman all because she took off her hat in public big brawl and maggie ends up stuck in panama romance carole and arthur are great together maggie is always there for him whenever he needs her she urges him to go to ny where well watch the movie and find out they have these wonderful scenes together where she sings in his arms while he plays the saxophone i definitely recommend it,1
this movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never had made a movie before nor had they considered that a script should be edited or even funny when i saw this film i saw it for john candy and assumed incorrectly that it would be hilarious instead there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat unfunny moments and to top it off candy delivered some of the crudest lines i had ever heard up to that time so despite a potentially funny cast and story idea we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult though teens will probably find a few laughs it's really a shame it could have been so much better i mean with eugene levy joe flaherty and john candy it should have been wonderful,0
one thing i always liked about robert ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out it goes in a completely different direction there are so many twists and turns in this film that i have a sore neck from watching br br one thing i also like about director john dahl kill me again rounders unforgettable is that he can be depended upon to direct and in this case write with his brother rick a good story br br now add nick cage dennis hopper lara flynn boyle and j t walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even if they are playing characters that all of them have perfected dahl seems to bring out the best in folks and this will keep you interested and guessing until the very end,1
even though the shining is over a quarter of a century old i challenge anyone to not get freaked out by jack nicholson's descent into madness this is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture the twins the elevator of blood redrum the crazy nonsense writing this should be seen if for nothing else to understand all the allusions to it in daily life the film is simultaneously scary suspenseful beautiful and psychologically intriguing it has the classic mystery of hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller and it has what horror movies usually lack a great script,1
a young woman who is a successful model and is also engaged to be married and who has twice attempted suicide in the past is chosen by a secretive and distant association of catholic priests to be the next sentinel to the gateway to hell which apparently goes through a creepy old but well maintained brooklyn apartment building its tenants take the stairway up and can reincarnate themselves but apparently can't escape as long as a sentinel is there to block the way the previous one john carradine is about dead so she by fate or whatever becomes the next one and the doomed must get her to kill herself in order for them to be free lots of interesting details lie under the surface her relationship with her father the stories of the doomed her fiancé so one can pass this off as cheap exploitation horror but given the sets the great cast and overall level of bizarreness this is definitely worth seeing,1
picture the fugly annoying goth kids from college in a scat film throw in a pinch of story and a whole lot of awful acting and you are still not even close to how bad this movie is br br shot badly bad effects worse acting contrived attempt at shocking horror everyone i've showed this to gets kinda depressed watching it the sex scenes are disturbing not necessarily for their content but more because they're just something you want to end as soon as possible the last sex scene is just foul even before she gets to the guy br br i'm one of those people that loves to watch movies that people hate which is why i picked this one up but for your own sake save yourself the time and avoid this abhorrence it's that bad i literally threw it in the garbage,0
bettie page was a icon of the repressed 1950s when she represented the sexual freedom that was still a decade away but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults gretchen mol does a superb job of portraying the scandalous bettie who was a small town girl with acting ambitions and a great body her acting career went nowhere but her body brought her to the peak of fame in an admittedly fringe field photogrsphed in black and white with color interludes when she gets out of the world of exploitation in new york this made for tv hbo film has good production values and a very believable supporting cast the problem is it's emotionally rather flat it's difficult to form an attachment to the character since bettie is portrayed as someone quite shallow and naive given the business she was in the self serving government investigations are given a lot of screen time which slows down the film towards the end but it's definitely worth watching for the history of the time and to see the heavy handed government repression that was a characteristic of the fifties 7 10,1
i think you would have to be from the usa to get a lot of the jokes but if you liked princess bride and forest gump you would like this movie you can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose killer tomatoes is a hundred times better than nepolean dynamite just my opinion i'm sure that people from france would not appreciate the caricatures of the french so this film isn't for a world audience and while i am not a trained film critic i know what i like i couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie my sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie,1
yes the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner matt monro it pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature stunningly miscast with george segal and ursula andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond add in harry andrews with a strange accent no less chasing an ostrich tons of stock footage of wildlife and poorly composed and dull photography by raoul coutard and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of senegal,0
this movie is one of the most provocative jesus movies i have ever seen it does not seek to tell the whole story but only to portray an interpretive expression of the last day of jesus christ it is darkly witty playful and seriously faithful to elements of the jewish tradition and to modern scriptural interpretation judas is much more ordinary than other portrayals not the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine but a grossly mistaken man horribly misguided in his zeal chris saranden's jesus is playful and serious faithful and committed very human while also divine the final dialog is thoughtfully done and serves as the kind of small talk that two powerful men might do when they have just committed an atrocity i would watch this movie again and recommend it to others,1
the cast although nothing special all do an ok job the story seems like a good idea the script is bearable and the end has quite a good twist so what's wrong with it br br for a start the special effects are really bad if this was made in the 60's it might look ok but in 2003 there is just no excuse for visuals as poor as this it makes me laugh that the dvd cover claims very proudly 'from the special effects creator of jeepers creepers' br br secondly the direction is weak this film just does not capture the essence of the story a doctor feeding the hospital inmates souls to the devil or demon type creature should be tense or frightening it simply isn't br br all in all this is a pretty poor film and although bearable and at times mildly entertaining it is still probably best left alone br br a rather sad 4 10,0
this is the worst thing the tmnt franchise has ever spawned i was a kid when this came out and i still thought it was deuce even though i liked the original cartoon br br there's this one scene i remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are it's atrocious many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle but that didn't bother me so much so that i didn't even remember her until i read about the show recently all in all it's miserably forgettable br br the only okay thing was the theme song guilty pleasure they call it nananana ninja,0
impressed this is the worst srk movie and one of the worst bollywood movies i ever saw i didn't like the novel but this movie made it worse very bad music even worse actors apart from srk of course though even he doesn't manage to save the movie and not much sense the director makes it all look very confusing god knows why maybe it's because he's trying to make it all look very surrealistic and yet credible well he manages neither br br even if you've got a few hours to loose don't watch this movie please saying this for your own welfare keep searching you will find something else to watch,0
this movie is chilling reminder of bollywood being just a parasite of hollywood bollywood also tends to feed on past blockbusters for furthering its industry br br vidhu vinod chopra made this movie with the reasoning that a cocktail mix of deewar and on the waterfront will bring home an oscar it turned out to be rookie mistake br br even the idea of the title is inspired from the elia kazan classic in the original brando is shown as raising doves as symbolism of peace br br bollywood must move out of hollywood's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously,0
sucks that's all i got to say about this sorry excuse for a film sucks sucks sucks i mean what the hell were they thinking the idiots involved should never be allowed to make another films the acting was so bad that it even failed to entertain on a bad level the attempt at a lesbian scene was sad i felt so bad for the ladies involved this movie sucks sucks sucks br br i heard rumors of a sequel br br god br br help br br us br br all,0
come on people this movie is better than 4 i can see this happening wealthy people have done crazier things than this and it was funny br br i watch a comedy to be entertained escape from the pressures of the world for a short while and not to have to take anything too seriously this movie fully suits that purpose i judge a movie on its own merits and am not about to compare surviving christmas to blazing saddles i watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring likable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home it will remain on my list of favorite must watch for the holiday season if you just want to have a fun 90 minutes watch this one,1
i took a chance on hardcastle and mccormick by purchasing the first season's worth canadian release from amazon when i got it i started with the pilot and i was instantly hooked after that i rated it 5 stars on amazon and i am rating it 10 stars here it is just that good what i liked about it were the opening and closing themes and of course stephen j cannell's logo at the end of each episode but most of all the relationship between the judge and mark as they worked together to crack each case i was so hooked that i also purchased the second season as a companion and i enjoyed it equally if you do not have this excellent series on disc i believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection,1
this is one of the greatest love story movies i have ever seen yes i can agree that some parts may seem dated but this does not distract from the film one should try to observe criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of the time clearly by the sex in the city standards charlie chaplin was horribly boring however when judged from the prospective of 1925 america he was fantastic likewise sayonara is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixed race love affair american manifest destiny arrogance and prejudice and the complexity of different cultures it is a natural next step to such films as gentleman's agreement its purpose however was not just social commentary rather it is entertaining and enjoyable with innumerable lines that one just doesn't forget br br however even when taken only as a love story it is terrific although some attack brando's accent he is at his near best in nuance and characterization buttons and umeki who both won oscars and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film br br taka the real star does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for brando while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty her speech when she first meets and speaks with brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema the dialog between taka and brando in her dressing room in tokyo at the film's end is equally good of course it doesn't have the mouth sucking spit swapping and worse that exemplifies love in today's movies but that makes it all the better it portrays true love and passion and not just heat if this movie doesn't touch you then you are just too young too cynical or dead,1
house of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part a psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the game br br have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators you're never sure of who is exactly who in this movie br br this is both a quality and a drawback of the script as the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency but all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development br br this is definitely one of the best movies about gambling,1
this is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the btk killer the events in this movie are not even close to the truth why they couldn't make a movie of the real events doesn't make any sense since the real events are more interesting then this made up farce don't even waste your time watching this for free low budget and a shameful depiction of the events which should not be made a joke of which is really what this movie did if they would allow me to give a 10 to this movie i would the acting sucked and it looks like it was shot on an old vhs video camera from the 80s save your time and money by not watching this movie,0
though this movie is cheesiness at its best it is pulled off perfectly this movie without a doubt has to be considered a modern classic there are basically two kinds of movies i like movies with depth chick flicks if you must i blame my wife for this and mindless comedies where i can sit back and relax this movie is a perfect example of the latter br br a friend of mine turned me on to this movie shortly after its release considering me to somewhat shallow he said to me you've got to see this movie it's just your type of movie foregoing the insult i started watching i know they mentioned the ramones a million times but when you actually see them i said hey it is the ramones my friend replied i don't know they were a real band i had my moment of glory br br this movie though now somewhat dated is a must see for ramones fans or anyone else for that matter,1
the night listener is probably not one of william's best roles but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before some people maybe won't like the slow pacing of this movie but i think it's the great plus of the movie it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year 2006 it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content dramatic feeling this is no americanized movie neither is it a predictable movie you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be this is no excellent movie that has everything but hell it's a damn good and very original movie,1
darkness was entertaining to some degree but it never seemed to have a plot lacking one more so than other films that have been accused of this detriment i e bad taste it started off really good with a man running from something it was very creepy for these first few minutes but after a time the film just became entertaining on the level of gore which was hard to make out at some points due to poor lighting and horrible recording quality anyway the film was hard to believe because of the juvenile acting which most of the time seemed like some friends talking to a video camera making lines up as they went that with a lack of any plot whatsoever made it look like the film was started without and ended without a script of any kind as said before gore was this film's only drawing point which much of the time was hard to make out,0
this is a wonderful movie with a fun clever story and the dynamics of culture differences and the running theme of what's important in life make this a very under appreciated movie don't let the cynics of the world deter you from seeing this keaton has wonderful moments and i wonder at the fact that comedy is never appreciated because actors like keaton make going from humor to serious bits look tremendously easy great movie all around,1
i think that elisabeth rohm though she may try hard is not very good at all i guess it was because of budget that she may have been the only one they could get for that price i mainly watched it for the performance of myron natwick whose work i know very well br br he was the most believable and without doubt the most compelling to watch when he wasn't on the screen the thing went dead this was filmed in vancouver he gave me the creeps but be assured that in real life he is a kind funny compassionate man he even said playing that role gave him the creeps br br i'll watch anything with him in it but elisabeth rohm never again she was as exciting as lint on law and order maybe a very nice person but no actress,0
i found the writing in this movie absolutely terrible br br the only thing that saved this movie from me rating it as a 1 out of 10 was lacy chabert's performance who i thought played the multiple personalities really well for me she was definitely the highlight of this movie br br dina meyer was pretty as always but i found her role pretty bland so i don't think one can say that her acting was great br br as for the male lead armand assante his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in cheese 1980s hospital series br br all of that i could have lived with however the terrible terrible terrible end solution the role of the psychic and even the role of psychic were just some of the worst writing i have seen in a long time,0
the only reason i even gave it a 1 out of 10 is because the option to give it zero out of 10 was not allowed this was the biggest waste of time i've ever endured for roughly 75 minutes you are subjected to the worst acting and i don't mean that in a good way either like as in killer nerd which had great horrible acting and a plot that is not only ridiculous but also has absolutely nothing to do with a massacre the reason i even rented this piece of crap was because it has massacre in the title that said there was only one killing in the entire movie and it was pretty lame at that you spend more time watching the kids bickering and doing yard work than anything speaking of the kids the little boy actor is probably the most irritating child actor since bob from house by the cemetery did i mention it was shot on video as well if you want to throw away money and over an hour of your life then by all means watch it but if you savor your hard earned dollars and time then stray as far away as possible,0
in this film made just as the production code was being enforced jean harlow is eadie and patsy kelly is the wisecracking man chasing sidekick kitty girl from missouri starts out with the girls getting on a train with eadie making a promise to herself to earn money while looking for a millionaire husband staying whole some in the process it doesn't take her long to meet up with frank cousins lewis stone was the kindly doctor in grand hotel as well as judge hardy in the andy hardy films but all is not as it seems the censors must have loved harlow's line a girl couldn't accept an expensive gift like that from a gentleman unless she was engaged later someone says you know we've never been alone together and eadie replies yeah and we're not going to be lionel barrymore is t r paige another rich uppercrust who comes to her rescue when trouble comes looking for eadie at one point paige declares you oughta scratch me off your list i'm not a ladies man i wonder what that line would have been just a couple years earlier before the hayes code came rolling into town what was he really saying carol tevis seems to be the high pitched baby talker as listed in the credits on imdb looks like she was only in showbiz from 1931 1939 with munchkin in wizard of oz being the last part she played fun cleancut romp as the girls chase men around the country look for nat pendleton as the lifeguard who was an olympic wrestler 1920 silver medal winner turned film star he was in many of the dr kildares and would appear in four of harlow's films mistaken identity plot twists a young franchot tone love stories even jean harlow in a bathing suit in palm beach although the outdoor scenes of downtown appear to be a backdrop,1
just cause is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative though exceedingly predictable writing sean connery is an anti death penalty crusader brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man blair underwood from the ultimate penalty to set things right connery ventures to the scene of the crime where he must contend not only with the passage of time but a meddling sheriff laurence fishbourne twists and turns and role reversals abound some surprising some not as the aging crusader attempts to unravel the mystery the climactic ending is a bit ludicrous but just cause is worth a look on a slow night,1
for me too this christmas special is one that i remember very fondly in 1989 i snatched up the 2 cds i found of the soundtrack recording giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself it's part of my family's christmas tradition now and i would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as i listen br br it has been noted elsewhere that john denver made a number of appearances on the muppet show and they did more than one special together the good rapport between denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages,1
i don't know what that other guy was thinking the fact that this movie was independently made makes it no less terrible you can be as big a believer as you want the majority of this film is mindless drivel i feel i have been insulted by having to watch the first 40 minutes of it and that alone was no small feat not only is the acting terrible but the plot is never even close to developed there are countless holes in the story to the point where you can hardly even call it a story anymore i've never read the book so i can't critique on that but this is the first review that i've written here and it's purpose is solely to save all you viewers out there an hour and a half of your life i can't remember the last time i couldn't even finish watching a movie this one really takes the cake,0
nice pleasant and funny but not earth shattering it does a good job of showing the behind the scenes world of theater groups and the lives of the actors the three witches are great both on and off stage i would assume the movie works wonderfully lots of apparent inside jokes if one was involved in theater which i'm not,1
where to begin there's so much wrong and horrible about this movie i am not sure where to start okay the two stooges who wrote this crapper joseph green and rex carlton first they couldn't make up their so called minds for a name my guess they split the difference that's why the main title is brain that wouldn't die but the end screen says head that wouldn't die neither one knows anything about the medical profession after all doctors take oaths to do no harm killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered harm plus a little thing called blood and tissue matching rejection would spell death for jan in the pan plus who keeps a patch work monster what medical school did bill graduate from frankenstien university old fu or mad scientist tech the monster had no name that bugs the hell out of me plus the brilliant surgeon doctor bill cortner doesn't know how to keep a patient sedated all and all a disaster of a movie it's incredibly stupid and unwatchable except on mst3k i give it the thanksgiving turkey,0
this is essentially a variation on house of wax in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both movies vincent price in both pictures he plays a talented artist who is sent toppling over the edge into insanity when his creations are usurped by other less talented and less scrupulous people in this movie he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspires to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another illusionist the great rinaldo john emery insists that he honour his contract and give him first choice of any illusions he designs price is already ill disposed towards rinaldi as his former wife is now a paramour of rinaldi he deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant mimic to avenge himself upon rinaldi and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and a designer br br price is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well judged star turn as a wronged man whose predicament earns audience sympathy the rest of the cast are competent if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on price who carries the burden with ease br br good solid b movie melodrama this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you don't expect a masterpiece shot in black and white it is low on gore and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance,1
when i saw the previews for this movie i didn't expect much to begin with around a second rate teen horror movie but wow this movie was absolutely awful and that's being generous br br first of all the casting for the movie was terrible you feel no sympathy or for that matter any morbid feeling for the characters the acting was so terrible that i was just simply waiting and hoping for the god awful thing to end br br secondly there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever can somebody please explain to me why the girlish looking boy starts screaming pancakes at the top of his lungs while going into jackie chan moves i've never seen before and even further biting the guy who has the virus why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus infected guy and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him i was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that i literally said out loud where the hell did that come from br br i just simply couldn't believe what i had seen i really thought i had seen some bad movies but i have to say that cabin fever tops them all this movie made me want to puke and then puke again then blow my brains out br br please save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive watching grass grow perhaps is a proper alternative,0
if the creators of this film had made any attempt at introducing reality to the plot it would have been just one more waste of time money and creative effort fortunately by throwing all pretense of reality to the winds they have created a comedic marvel who could pass up a film in which an alien pilot spends the entire film acting like jack nicholson complete with the lakers t shirt do not dismiss this film as trash,1
i think that if i went to a first school somewhere deep in the countryside and asked the bottom set of english to come up with a script it would make more sense than this i could then go to the first year drama group and they would act it out better than the jokers in this film this sounds really mean but i'm certain that they made this as a joke and are entirely aware that they possess see what i did there neither the skills to act or to write anything ever br br watch this only if you're incredibly drunk high or in need of a good excuse as to why your decaying corpse was found with slit wrists i will now go to my fish bowl and collect all of the poo at the bottom after that i will mould it into the shape of a disc and put it into my dvd player fully expecting it to produce something far better than this trumpery br br acting 0 10 plot lol 10 breasts 9 10,0
as far as parody films go there are few that are worth time and energy but with a recent resurgence of horrid parodies such as date movie and the comebacks it is a breath of fresh air to come back and rediscover a truly funny farce like johnny dangerously br br after his mother has no end of medical problems little johnny goes to work for the mob what fallows is a series of gags most of which work there are however the occasional flops but a foreign gangster who can't master the american language profanity wise at least a rival gangster with a penchant for shooting his mouth off once a younger brother with the d a who is out to get johhny dangerously and a hot young starlet hot for his affections have johnny busy br br and the viewer will be busy laughing for the most part as every gangster movie cliché is skewered by a talented cast and decent writing br br not perfect by a long shot but definitely good for a smile on a bad day,1
i only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title it now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films it is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully it has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world i fell in love with this film and with the characters in it it is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric beales a true aristocratic family it has a tangible atmosphere and i found myself wishing i could be there away from it all cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table it has an air of sadness that permeates throughout a fall from greatness for this once esteemed family the money had gone but their airs and graces remained as well as their beauty it drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished i found myself wondering about their fate wondering that if i took a walk along east hampton beach i might still hear old edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of little edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper unforgettable,1
christopher lee is one of my favorite actors i'm trying to view all of his work he has been known to single handedly save movies with his presence unfortunately this is not one of them this movie suffers from a low budget and it's production values are disturbing please for the love of christopher avoid this film,0
this is the best of shelley duvall's high quality faerie tale theatre series the ugly stepsisters are broadway quality comedy relief and eve arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood jennifer beals does an excellent job as a straight cinderella especially in the garden scene with matthew broderick's prince charming jean stapleton plays the fairy godmother well although i'm not sure i liked the southern lady characterization with some of the lines steve martin's comedy relief as the royal orchestra conductor is quintessential martin but a tiny bit misplaced in the show's flow br br as is customary with the series there are several wry comments thrown in for the older children ages 15 and up with a couple of small bumps the show flows well and they live happily ever after children up to age 8 will continue to watch it after the parents finally get tired of it i found 3 times in one day to be a little too much,1
this is the best emma in existence in my opinion having seen the other version 1996 which is also good and read the book i think i can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to jane austen's masterpiece the 1996 movie with g paltrow is good too it's just that it's almost like a different story altogether it's very light and fluffy you don't see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie that one would do fine but the intricacies of some of the plot points such as the churchill fairfax entanglement is so much glossed over as to be virtually non existent but if you want the characters fleshed out a bit more real and multidimensional the 1996 tv version is the superior emma is a remarkable person but she is flawed kate beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirks of the character you see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of harriet smith yet she shows no remorse for having ruined harriet's proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending you see her narcissism and it mirrors frank churchill's in that they would do harm to others to achieve their own aims for emma it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her governess to marriage for frank churchill it is securing the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret in the book she realizes all of this in a crushing awakening to all the blunders she has made both kate beckinsale and gyneth paltrow are convincing in their remorse but paltrow's is more childlike and stagnant while beckinsale's awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child like selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult both versions are very good but i prefer this one,1
this is a beautiful film the true tale of bond between father and son this is by far tom hanks at his finest tom hanks is really out of the box in this movie he usually has the nice guy roles yet in this film he comes off in this film as a bit gritty but still emerges smelling like a rose even until the very last scene the assassination of his character the cast of this movie was well put together i also love the part when there is total silence when tom hanks' character shoots and kills all of the men in mr rooney's group there is something chilling and yet profound about no sound in that scene just simply emotion i love the look on john rooney paul newman's character's face when he realizes even before seeing him that it is tom hanks's character getting revenge and he knows his fate has come the first time i saw this movie i was blown away and knew i had to go out and get the video and i since have adding it to my collection of my all time favorite movies br br tom hanks is my favorite actor so this film has a special place in me,1
although i really enjoyed jim carrey's latest serious performances the truman show man on the moon i've always thought his real genious lies in physical comedy this is not to say he is a fantastic talented actor those bozos at the academy awards seem to dislike him so much he has never had a truly deserved nomination or award well any institution that nominates for 11 oscars a bore such as titanic shouldn't be taken seriously br br on with the review the grinch is the sweetest best looking best acted more enjoyable seasons film since the nightmare before christmas both movies seem very similar too with their highly stylized sets and the premise of someone stealing christmas both make their principal actors seem like the villains one in a higher degree than the other both pack a strong moral lesson and both are truly enjoyable br br that is until you realize that jack skellington is a doll and the grinch is a human being but a human being that is so incredibly expressive so fluid in his movements so cartoon like so unreal that never gets in the way of the movie he can be hilarious he can be a sad soul he can be angry he lives in a 3 dimensional world where 3 dimensional people live he jokes he laughs he cries and ultimately he saves the christmas i loved this film to bits and cannot wait for it to come out on dvd this is one of those films you will really enjoy 10 20 years from now as timeless as they come,1
now don't get me wrong if you need an insightful summary of everything that been wrong with the history of human civilization as well as a flawless path to brighter future for mankind who better to turn to than a comedian and practitioner of pop culture if you need a healthy dose of all the solid sound reasons why religion has outlived it's usefulness then turn to sagan or dawkins not bill maher for god's sake that's a good point in and of itself maher dismisses our religious past as a neurological disorder conveniently ignoring how his entire society art and science is rooted in it br br in this film he relies heavily on his keenly honed skill set of irony and cynicism to make his point while attempting to appear erudite and wise unfortunately his intellect isn't up to the task br br maher makes us laugh but is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box as an example he responds to an interviewee's and i use the term loosely as they were clearly all ambushees assertion that the existence of jesus is historical fact with a deadpan no it's not followed by a long stare meant to convey contempt at the subject's naivety a device nauseatingly overused in this film the problem is that the person was correct and maher dead wrong in his assertion that jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically suspect gospels i guess mr maher has never read the contemporary historian josephus br br but the masses will flock to this pseudo documentary as they do the fictional works of other intellectual giants like michael moore and they will loudly bray and guffaw they certainly did at my showing br br it's doubly telling however that the loudest and most mule like braying occurred during the approximately 70 of the running time that the film devoted to it's anti christian tirade while the audience was wholly mute during the token 10 devoted to criticizing the self described religion of peace hmmm either criticism of islam is off limits to the hip and liberal target audience or they were just afraid to laugh very telling either way,0
i've been willing to put up with a lot from late spring summer action fluff movies but in general that's been due to the fact that most of them have reasonable payoff i e cool special effects interesting plot twists comic value steve buscemi etc this movie however had none of this all that we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of eva longoria's cleavage an issue of maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket there is an embarrassing lack of plot suspense back story character development continuity etc i would get into specifics but quite frankly i've already maybe willingly forgotten most of the movie br br the entire time i was in the theater i was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a 24 season on dvd save your money on this one folks unless you really really really like eva longoria's cleavage,0
this drama is unlike sex and the city where the women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other its much more personal and people can relate to it its much more engaging and emotional on a new level than other dramas focusing on women and their lives like sex and the city lipstick jungle br br dr katie roden is a psychologist with a dark secret she seems much more depressed and guilt ridden than the rest of her 3 friends she is dealing with the death of her former lover who was her patient while tackling his son's advances on her her sombre clothes and empty and cold house convey her inside emotions very well br br trudi malloy a widow is battling issues with letting go of her dead husband from 9 11 and when a handsome stranger richard shows an interest in her she is suddenly forced to do a reality check by her friends who suggest that she gets back into dating business the ridiculous and embarrassing courting scenes between richard and trudi are totally funny it is interesting to note that richard asks her out the day she gets a millions from the 9 11 board for her husband's death lets see what his intentions are br br siobhan dillon a lawyer is fed up of her husband's love making tactics which only involve baby making as they are having trouble conceiving and she quickly falls for her colleague who offer his services a little too willingly to her and she does not hesitate for long it will interesting to see whether she will continue her affair or patch up with her husband played by raza jeffrey jessica a real estate business woman is single and is straight until she organizes a lesbian wedding and has an affair with one of them her character is shown as a bold and provocative woman who before her lesbian encounter is having sex with a married man her colleague lets see where her character venture to br br the beauty of this drama is that we are shown 4 totally different women with different scenarios whose ambitions and inhibitions are shown its also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other to be safe,1
in the opening scenes of this movie a man shot arrows through his hotel room into another man's bathroom and blew out all the lights this must have been very hep for 1936 but rather way way out and had nothing to do with the film robin hood did not make an appearance as far as i could see however bette davis daisey appleby the whales of august '87 was very young and attractive and performed one of her best roles in a long career in hollywood daisey never stopped teasing or being very sexy with her nightgowns and so called swim suit on her yacht with george brent johnny jones the spiral staircase '46 daisey even proposed marriage to johnny in a ferris wheel upside down and even got a black eye davis and brent made a great couple one suppose to be very rich and the other a very poor reporter off stage davis and brent were having a real torrid love affair which is good reason why there was sparks when these two appeared in this film if you liked bette davis and george brent this is the film for you,1
kurt russell is so believable and the action so non stop that it takes thinking about it afterward to realize that there were honest to goodness important themes overcoming fear of the stranger learning to rise above early conditioning the strength that love and friendship can bring etc in the storyline this is so very rare for a 'guy's action flick' that even i who thinks most a a is violent pap liked the film and have recommended it to every guy i know it's a shame this one was overlooked because by rights it should have been one of the biggest action adventure box office hits it has something for everyone without straining credulity or losing the nearly non stop action moments i'm afraid the answer to it not becoming a hit lies in the fact that adults did not go to see it anyone under 20 probably has not only seen more violent action in their video games but probably would either not catch the multi layered multi themed beauty or not care about it this film could convert anyone who avoids a a as mindless violence if a guy takes his lady or rents it or sees it in a cable listing to see this film he'll be much more likely to get her to go with him to other action flicks,1
this is one of the best crime drama movies during the late 1990s it was filled with a great cast a powerful storyline and many of the players involved gave great performances pacino was great he should have been nominated for something john cusack was good too as long as the viewer doesn't mind his louuu siana accent he may come off as annoying if you can't stand this dialect the way that pacino's character interacted with cusack's character was believable dramatic and slightly comical at times danny aiello was superb as always david paymer was great in a supporting role bridget fonda was good but not memorable there were times when this picture mentioned so many characters probably too many it may take a second viewing to remember which zapatti was which after so many cross references one has to stop and think just to recap the ending didn't have a lot of sting it was built up for so long and then was a bit of a letdown this was one of the few problems with the film since the movie wasn't billed as a huge blockbuster big screen hit it made some forget that this movie even existed pacino and aiello were great but the film's lack of splash in the theaters may have accounted for no nominations it was semi successful in the home market and viewers are still learning that this title is out there made in 1996 it still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to come br br so make yourself some lemon pudding you'll see and see this movie,1
i don't have much to add to what has been said before but it's very much a film of it's time and the first and likely only time that the studio hung the film totally on the dead end kids br br the warner's gave the boys plenty of help from director ray enright and an 'a' budget to an almost magical cast of supporting actors at every turn we get one of those gem performances from real pros they are too many to list but it seems like just about everybody on the warner's lot sans the very biggest stars walk through this picture see if you can spot john ridgely br br the only over the top performance is from the always reliable eduardo cianelli as a mob boss with a messianistic complex he plays this character almost exactly like that of the thuggie leader in gunga din he's something to watch and marjorie main is excellent and gets her best role since dead end br br my bid for this one is a second feature on a double bill with something like city for conquest br br hooray for warners,1
ooof this one was a stinker it does not fall 'somewhere in between star wars and thriller' thats for sure in all actuality it falls somewhere between the cracks of a wham video and captain eo only with not as big of a budget and a lot more close ups of ugly teenagers crying simon le bon preens front and center while the rest of the band gamely tries to hide the fact that they stole their whole career from roxy music's last 3 albums brief clips from barbarella add nothing avoid at all costs however i liked the part when they played 'hungry like the wolf' but why was there a tiger lurking in the audience changing into a woman painted with tiger stripes i mean they aren't singing 'eye of the tiger' or 'hungry like the tiger' it's a wolf whatever a dvd of duran duran's '80s videos is probably worth a look for nostalgia's sake,0
have just finished watching this film which upset me greatly have also been to south africa twice around the time this film is set br br it is certainly hard hitting and the opening scenes tend to 'set the scene' the slow but steady increase of pace hardly allows a break and there are certainly few light moments br br will never be able to view nigel hawthorne the same again he came across as a very twisted individual and i found myself disliking him more each time he appeared br br totally agree with steve thomp's articulate and well thought out comments,1
after repeated listenings to the cd soundtrack i knew i wanted this film got it for christmas and i was amazed marc bolan had such charisma i can't describe it i'd heard about him in that way but didn't understand what people were talking about until i was in the company of this footage he was incredible clips from the wembley concert are interspersed with surrealistic sketches such as nuns gorging themselves at a garden party as marc bolan performs some acoustic versions of get it on etc i'm still learning the song titles george claydon the diminutive photographer from magical mystery tour plays a chauffeur who jumps out of a car and eats one of the side mirrors nothing i can say to describe it would spoil it even though i put the spoilers disclaimer on this review so you would just need to see this for yourselves it evades description br br yes i love the beatles and was curious about ringo directing a rock documentary that was 35 years ago now i finally find out it's been on dvd for 2 years but it's finally in my home it's an amazing viewing experience even enthralling br br now the dvd comes with hidden extras and the following is a copy and paste from another user br br there's two hidden extras on the born to boogie double dvd release br br 1 from the menu on disc one select the bonus material and goto the extra scenes 2 on the extra scenes page goto scene 42 take 1 and keep pressing left 3 when the cursor disappears keep pressing right until a star 1972 logo appears 4 press enter br br 5 from the main menu on disc two select the sound options 6 on the sound options page goto the 90 25 i think thats right option and keep pressing left 7 when the cursor disappears keep pressing right until a star home video logo appears 8 press enter,1
this tear teaser written by steve martin himself is so unbelievably bad it makes you sick to your stomach br br the plot is pathetic the acting awful and the dialogue is even more predictable than the ending br br avoid at all costs,0
many people like to point to this tv movie when arguing with the vast legions of hanks philes out there that tom did in fact make crappy films i think bachelor party was great but that's another story the movie focuses on a dungeons and dragons style game that eventually drives our young gump to hallucinatory madness the story is charmingly early 1980s focusing as it does on the imminent threat to our youth posed by those evil role playing games br br i however prefer to view mazes and monsters as the turning point in the whatever happened to chris makepeace story we all remember him as 'rudy the rabbit' in meatballs and as the hapless clifford in my bodyguard where he gave us all a vicarious thrill by beating the crap out of matt dillon few could argue especially those of us who read dynamite on a regular basis that great things were in store for him br br and then came rona jaffe the line between bad acting and bad writing is razor thin so i leave it to you to decide whose fault makepeace's performance in this is all i know is that the last major release i saw him in was vamp and that was 1986 he had a small role as sean penn's brother in falcon and the snowman but by that time the brat pack torch had been passed to others with straighter hair and flashier resumes br br i can't in good conscience recommend this movie watch it if only to see a younger more idealistic chris makepeace before rona jaffe feasted on his soul,0
the movie was awful the theater was dead with silence 'cause everyone was embarrassed to be in there watching such trash i think someone gave jet li a lobotomy and made him perform a script with dialogue written by a five year old the martial arts are 'ok' but when put next to the jackie chan movies and the matrix you're better off seeing one of those,0
i liked chiba in street fighter and i figured hey no matter how stupid this movie will be i'll at least get to see him kick some ass right wrong this is a dull dreary mess of pointless talking half assed scriptwriting and meaningless scheming there are few action scenes of any kind even fewer martial arts scenes and the few that are are shot and edited so poorly that you can't even make out what in the world is going on the dub is also atrocious and perhaps the idiocy that is this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it supposedly features the italian mafia except they're all japanese avoid like the plague you would see better martial arts by looking through the window of your local preschool karate class for five minutes,0
the zombie chronicles br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 nu view 3 d br br sound format mono br br whilst searching for a literal ghost town in the middle of nowhere a young reporter emmy smith picks up a grizzled hitchhiker joseph haggerty who tells her two stories involving flesh eating zombies reputed to haunt the area br br an absolute waste of time hobbled from the outset by haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role worse still the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by brad sykes previously responsible for the likes of camp blood 1999 this isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that ed wood's movies are 'fun' he at least believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts despite a lack of talent sykes' home made movies are in fact aggravating boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative badly conceived junk the 3 d format is utterly wasted here,0
i did not set very high expectations for this movie which left me pleasantly surprised the story is a little strange sometimes but overall i think it has an acceptable credibility the action scenes are rather nice and the accompanying music is used to induce a a bit of patriotic feelings common to us movies this may not be the best movie ever but it's uncommon for sweden and i hope to see more similar ones in the future,1
i love the series many of the stereotypes portraying southerrners as hicks are very apparent but such people do exist all too frequently the portrayal of southern government rings all too true as well but the sympathetic characters reminds one of the many good things about the south as well some things never change and we see the good old boys every day there is a lucas buck in every southern town who has only to make a phone call to make things happen and the storybook po' white trash are all too familiar aside from the supernatural elements everything else could very well happen in the modern south i somehow think trinity sc must have been in barnwell county,1
ag was an excellent presentation of drama suspense and thriller that is so rare to american tv sheriff lucas gave many a viewer the willies we rooted for caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of sheriff lucas we became engrossed and fearful upon learning of the unthinkable connection between these two characters the manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear what lucas would do next were truly surprising this show lived up to the gothic moniker in ways american entertainment has so seldom attempted much less mastered the suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show this show puts shame to the current glut of reality shows which are so less than satisfying viewing the call for a dvd box set is well based this show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing a public that is tiring of over saturation of mind numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling bring on the dvd box set,1
this film was hard to get a hold of and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming i mean this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt with all of this built in interest how could anyone make such a lackluster talk laden flick of this true life event while williams is always interesting the screenwriters assumed that the d b cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star s what we get is a type without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction shame on this film for even existing,0

an excellent documentry i personally remember this growing up in nyc in the early 80's this movie is for anyone that wasn't around during that time period this shows the one thing the african american gay underclass felt was solely theirs and the love and camadrie you see is real the people are real and sadly few are still alive as this is being written the balls are still held but not to the extent that they were in the the nineteen eighties that time is gone forever this is a good pre homo thug movie when queens were really proud to be extroverts goodbye to storyville this is another era gone but greatly documented all hail film,1
i really enjoyed this episode seeing the flash cyborg green arrow and aquaman even though all he did was swim made my eyes widen to see most of the founders of the justice league trying to bring down lex luthor is what i've been waiting for this sounds a bit off topic but making a live action justice league show would definitely make me have a reason to shove everything that i usually do during the week down the drain just to watch one episode this is the thrill i got from watching this episode i wish they had made this episode a little longer like a two hour special because i felt that one hour of the justice league wasn't enough now before i bore you unless i already have with my rambling i just want to say smallville is cool again it sort of lost its touch when the show started focusing on lana but i'm sure the writers will just fall back into that loop hole so enjoy this episode who knows when another good one's going to come out catch it again this thursday feb 22 if you missed the first airing,1
while the soundtrack is a bit dated this story is more relevant in the u s now more than ever with not only blue collar jobs but everyone's jobs being outsourced by u s corporations while the government profits and american suffer br br peter strauss is emory a steel worker who works the same job his father did for 35 years his wife is well portrayed by pamela reed who is very realistic trying to support the family with two children when emory loses his job the mill is closed under the pretext of mismanagement but there is also embezzlement and cheaper wages where they can pay one steelworker in one month outsourcing what they would have to pay strauss emory in a day never mind that these men are all good loyal workers who have values and try the best for their family br br john goodman gary cole as strauss' brother and a few other co workers are also affected it is very disturbing and realistic some scenes between emory and his father are moving emory hopes his local union will be able to re open the mill as they promise to do so br br emory's brother lee already sees the writing on the wall there are no jobs left in the rust belt ohio and they must move on however where in the u s can they move to where will it be better for a blue collar steel worker br br there is a triumphant scene at the end where emory and his crew fill the loading dock with steel products the guard allows them to do this as a final gesture one of the men committed suicide and he has empathy br br overall a good message film about hard times right here in america something that few care to face until personally affected 8 10,1
words can't simply describe how awful this film is i watched it on video last night and i simply could not believe what i was seeing basically snakeeater is about an ex military man lorenzo lamas and his search for his kidnapped sister who has been held captive by deliverance style rednecks the film's acting writing direction photography and editing are deplorable along with a song called soldier that has to be one of the worst theme songs of all time br br however there is one treat horshack ron pallio from welcome back carter is in the film playing a laughable bad guy otherwise please avoid this mess at all costs,0
this motion picture comes straight out of the dark dungeon of full moon entertainment this production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the 90's by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movies the most famous disasters in their ouvre are subspecies seedpeople and trancers none of these are recommended and neither is doctor mordrid actually hyperactive director charles band did come to the right company for his film doctor mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely humourless i only saw it because it stars jeffrey combs i learned that it can have several disadvantages if you're a fan of him for every good movie it seems like he has made 5 inferior ones anyways the story is about the battle between 2 ancient sorcerers one good one who's here since 150 years to protect the humans jeffrey as dr mordrid and one wicked one called kabal he wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason i already forgot combs gets his instructions from mentor that guy only exists of a pair of eyes in space very very cheesy that is every once and a while a blinding lightflash is shown on the screen but that's about the only form of special effects this movie has got the whole thing is just a piece of whining and nagging and when the two wizards finally face each other it's over before you know it i would have expected for the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little but nooooooo in some scenes you really can detect some originality and creativity like for example jeffrey's lecture about the influence of the moon on criminals and if you really pay attention you might even find some very small but nice aspects like the raven which is called edgar allen but overall it's a terrible waste of time and energy i'm a big fan of jeffrey and maybe he is a superhero in my eyes but he sure doesn't have to put on a stupid maillot for that,0
i have watched this movie well over 100 200 times and i love it each and every time i watched it yes it can be very corny but it is also very funny and enjoyable the camp shown in the movie is a real camp that i actually attended for 7 years and is portrayed as camp really is a great place to spend the summer everyone who has ever gone to camp wanted to go to camp or has sent a child to camp should see this movie because it'll bring back wonderful memories for you and for your kids,1
this movie was excellent i was not expecting it to live up to all the hype but it did like all the bourne movies the action is fast paced realistic and intense if you liked the other two movies in the trilogy you will love this one also the movie's plot is straightforward and there are no plot twists that are too unrealistic ok julia stiles character showing up in the italian safe house was kind of far fetched especially after what happened in supremacy but it makes sense that she is the only character in treadstone that bourne knows that does not want him dead and he could possibly trust and the only person to lead him in the right direction the action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening all around them the thing that i always loved about the bourne movies is that bourne can kick butt but when matched with people as good as he is the fights are struggles and he takes a lot of damage in them they never treat the audience like idiots br br all the actors were solid in their performances i believe that damon could play bourne in his sleep and receives excellent support from joan allen reprising her role from supremacy david strathairn and scott glenn i recommend this film and the trilogy i do miss franka potente though,1
i grew up in brazil and i used to visit and marvel at the beautiful coast where the movie was filmed the area is called parati and is part of the green coast of the rio de janeiro state it is some 150 miles from the rio de janeiro city br br this movie brings back to life the world of 16th century brazil where europeans were barely starting to explore the coastline which was still in pristine state and sparsely populated by various native tribes french and portuguese fought each other for territory and for the upper hand on the brazil wood trade all the while negotiating with the natives who also fought each other for whatever reasons br br one french misfit a mercenary is left to die by his own compatriots but manages to escape and is kept prisoner by an all naked native tribe while he is a slave of the chief according to the customs of the tribe he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months until the time is right for him to be killed and eaten in a ritual of revenge br br what i love about this film is that it recreates in loving detail the natives' villages and their way of life they walked naked and were cannibals and asks us to recognize and accept the life in those times as it was in a gorgeous garden of eden life was messy violent full of pathetic superstition and bizarre customs the europeans arrive and bring their own problems including more violence with better weapons and greed there is no romanticized noble savages or heroic explorers here it is just people trying to survive in a tough world br br the movie is neither unduly sympathetic nor dismissive of the natives from what i know of the subject the depiction is fairly accurate which adds an air of uniqueness to the project how many movies have you seen regarding the lives of brazilian natives and their early affairs with europeans,1
i found the pace to be glacial and the original story blown way out of proportion to the content my wife slept through most of it and i did not try to wake her because i felt she was not missing anything br br when holmes and watson enter the house and then are potentially caught it is unclear how they could hide all of their entry and burglary tools so quickly it is also unclear how the door to the study is locked preventing the servants from getting in br br the thing that puzzled me was right at the end when there was a glint in the eye of the broken statute i have no clue what this was supposed to represent,0
the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in a year when most movergoers were stay at homes watching their new 7 motorola televisions almost all recent box office figures are false because they fail to adjust inflation obviously today's 10 movies will dominate in 1951 it cost 90c to 1 60 at radio city 44c to 75c first run at loew's palace in washington dc or 35c to 50c in neighborhood runs what counts is the number of people responding to the picture not unadjusted box office media spin the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of enrico caruso really not a great story anyway and threw it in the trash instead 90 of the movie's focus was on the music thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the best ever historic opera singer enrico caruso the result was a wonderful movie too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeating too fat to play the student prince edmund purdom took his place with lanza's voice dubbed in and with the formerly handsome and not fat lanza pictured in the advertising if you want to see the great caruso it's almost always on ebay for 2 00 or less don't be put off by the low price as it reflects only the easy availability of copies not the quality of the movie,1
black and white film good photography believable characters br br just awful br br i have wasted another perfect evening watching a film that other rated as worthy and very good there is some good acting here and the back ground setting for the plot is good more should have been done with this but it is very slow to grow and never develops it is totally bases on sex without much romance with much un needed nudity more could have been done with the main characters if you are looking for something to watch with you family this in not the movie and if not you will have trouble sitting through it though this film is long its only about 1 inch deep,0
no wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie it's just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a disneyland attraction students fist fight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue the watts riots with a cast of ugh 10 dermot mulroney tries not to gag while he makes out with a mary hartman look alike with the most annoying smile since 'mr sardonicus' noah wyle reads bob dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift drunken virgin rick schroder sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service silly giggling school girls dress up in leopard stretch pants and walk on the set of 'shindig' sing horribly off key and actually make it big in the music business and who wrote this compelling dialog i'm going to burkley and wear flowers in my hair i think i found someone to buy stick's woody these people are 'animals' these people are my 'family' as the shirelles sing mama said oh brother what a mess this is like a 'reefer madness' of the 60's except it's not even funny,0
we watched this in my women's health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies and i absolutely loved this movie i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating this is a movie i will show to my children the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women but this movie was more than that it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite,1
buck's role as the kahn brings to mind bob barker of the price is right running a country the same way he runs his show but there's lots more to chuckle and snort through in this turkey kurt thomas as the baby faced hero displays some considerable acrobatic skills but not a whit of acting talent whatsoever there's a few spooky moments in the village of crazies mostly and some mildly impressive martial arts sequences but any given ninja movie will give you much more entertainment and you won't feel as guilty about laughing,0
the fact that this movie has been entitled to the most successful movie in switzerland's film history makes me shake my head it's true but pitiful at the same time a flick about the swiss army could be a good deal better br br the story sounds interesting at the beginning antonio carrera michael koch gets forced to absolve his military training by the army while he is in the church wedding his love laura moretti mia aegerter br br the acting in some way doesn't really differ from just a few recruits getting drunk and stoned in the reality melanie winiger plays her role as the strong michelle bluntschi mediocre personally i found her rather annoying br br the storyline contains a comedy combined with a romance which does not work as expected the romance part is too trashy and the comedy part is not funny at all it's just a cheap try and does not change throughout the whole movie whatsoever it's funny for preadolescent 12 13 year olds but not for such as those who search an entertaining comedy the humor is weak except for some shots br br dope cool stealing cool if you want a proper comedy about the swiss rs make sure you did not absolve your military training yet and even then don't expect too much br br i'll give it 4 out of 10 stars because marco rima is quite funny during his screen time not a hell of a lot screen time though,0
bizarre take on the cinderella tale terribly poor script but kathleen turner turns in a pretty decent evil step mother performance br br visually stunning in some parts but that's about it the period costumes range from the elizabethan era to the 1990s fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full 90 minutes of drivel br br if you're really in the mood for a cinderella story i suggest ever after a cinderella story or the glass slipper,0
today i visited an athenean cinema with my two kids 6 8 years old payed 3 x 12 euros about 45 us total not to mention gas popcorn soda was asked to return my 3d special glasses after leaving the theater and was forced to watch what could have been a great 3d movie masterpiece but only proved to be a sick cold war like propaganda movie like none i have seen during the last 20 years and this is supposed to be a movie for children in heaven's name br br ps 1 the average working greek makes no more than 850 euros a month approxiamtely 1050 us br br ps 2 my kids liked it but then again they are no more than babies in greek mora morons like the one who wrote the script the others who made this 3d disgrace happen br br ps 3 3d animation is fantastic but who gives a,0
this is one of the most interesting movies i have ever seen i love the backwoods feel of this movie the movie is very realistic and believable this seems to take place in another era maybe the late 60's or early 70's henry thomas works well with the young baby very moving story and worth a look,1
i voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story i have been able to see in quite some time the animation is stunning the artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful from the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry i was amazed moving beyond the beauty on the screen you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh character development is brief yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand i'm impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family,1
this film recently voted as an audience favorite at the 2005 palm springs international film festival is inspiring and moving a famous conductor forced to retire by illness returns to the small village of his birth to become the leader of the church choir and finally find fulfillment in his music drawing on sweedish traits of keeping things within oneself and of the insular character of a small swedish village this film develops each of its characters well superbly directed acted and sung it brought tears to many eyes and smiles to all hopefully it will find distribution in the united states br br if you can see it,1

i have to mention two failures for you to understand that this movie brilliantly succeeded where they failed a scanner darkly and immortel ad vitam if you were excited by the concepts of these two movies and felt woefully disappointed like me you will probably enjoy renaissance it immerses you into the world of a future paris it is not quite dystopian they did the animation so well that i thought it was rotoscoped but from what i can tell it was not it was merely motion capture the facial expressions are amazing not since tron have i seen a fantasy world so well displayed in an animation live hybrid the black and white medium is used to slowly direct your attention to the subject of the scene my favorite effect was what they did with headlight beams watch for it the director plays with your attention and confusion but you are satisfied eventually by finding the thread that he wants you to find the overall effect is a harsh and gritty urban world filled with small surprises br br the plot is secondary but it isn't terrible it is noir ish there is a backstory for most of the major characters giving them some depth there is weather there are sets so you can feel like you are in different places in paris there is some action and even a car chase i am going to have to see this one again to get everything i also recommend a very large screen to view it as the sets are detailed and the credits are small,1
i couldn't wait to put this movie in my dvd player when i rented it then after i started it i couldn't wait to get it out of my dvd player actually i watched all of the movie my wife and i kept waiting and waiting for something funny to happen but nothing funny ever does the box read like the it would be really funny the premise of the movie sound good ben stiller is funny jack black is funny how could this movie miss well it does miss this is the unfunniest comedy i have ever watched nobody i have talked with thought it was even slightly funny it is just a really lame movie trust me avoide it avoide it,0
sure for it's super imagery and awesome sound it's a great home theater show off disk but this is also a touching drama as well as an informative documentary the parallel stories that are intertwined throughout this film will keep all viewers interested young old boys and girls alike will find that deep down we are all fans of the automobile especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations blood sweat tears ingenuity and perseverance the mark knopfler and ry cooder sound track is perfectly matched to the visuals and the content i don't want to give away the ending but the final driving sequence to quincy jones' days like these just might bring a tear to your eye enjoy it,1
atlantis is a new and right step for a disney feature it's a good choice to make a film by such a mysterious legend like atlantis i didn't have any expectations for this film but after watching it i don't quite understand why this film got so bad reviews even in my country the reviewers weren't positive br br atlantis is not a perfect movie but still one of disney's greatest even i doubt that this film ever will get disney classic reputation well that's another case it's funny to think that this sci fi movie was directed by the same directors as beauty and the beast and hunchback so kirk wise and gary trousdale are trying to get away from their monster movies reputation he he i'm just kidding br br well enough nonsense atlantis is a watchable exiting and very enjoyable film even this film it's a pg rated action feature it's also suitable for kids in my opinion parents who mean the opposite don't kill me for writing this he he br br the story is a little predictable but it doesn't ruin the movie the comic book inspired animation it's suitable for the film and set's a departure from the usual disney style it's colorful dark and detailed the deep canvas sequences are pretty impressive the film is also funny sometimes even i more giggled than laugh through the movie spoilers the characters of this film are also very likable but unfortunately there isn't enough screen time to get to know everybody so some characters are left behind spoilers br br the score of james newton howard is absolutely great it's daring and exotic spoiler the most impressive about this film is how they're making the atlantean language sound very natural ethnic and authentic it's really awesome spoilers over br br the script is tight and well written but still the there are some questions left unanswered in the story but luckily there are not so much of them br br so do you're self a favor don't listen to the reviewers and watch atlantis cause it's waiting for you,1
i caught this movie on sci fi before heading into work if you've any interest in seeing dean cain dive and avoid being enveloped in flames at least a dozen times this movie is for you if that doesn't peak your interest well i'm afraid you'll wish that you were the one about to be enveloped in flames because this movie is pretty bad the acting to begin with is awful awful awful the characters are all completely obnoxious and the dialogue is worse than your typical z grade sci fi movie towards the end the movie began to remind me of 'hollow man' complete with escape via elevator shaft except with a dragon not a naked invisible man unlike other similar flicks however this one wasn't even awesomely bad it was just plain bad,0
any person with fairly good knowledge of german cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past if such a film is shown to people again it would surely click provided if it has something new fresh and captivating for today's challenging audiences this is also true for german film maker sylke enders as her film's principal protagonist kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend she is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting kroko was originally shot on dv to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser if someone were to state a positive aspect of sylke enders' film it may well be kroko's involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment it is with kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their unique joys and sorrows,0
well i can and will be very short this is a wrong balanced non convincing film that could have been a little bit better the script seems to not know which way to go from funny to cliche wise serious it's a bit silly that plus too much sentences we have heard before the hacker is in florida or no he is in madrid no he is in he is screwing the signal br br 4 out of 10,0
throughly enjoy all the musical numbers each time i see this movie never seem to tire of it fred and ginger are always a pleasure to watch seeing lucy and betty grable before they hit the big time is fun to watch,1
spoilers ahead br br this is one of the worst movies ever made it's that simple there is not one redeeming quality about this movie the first 10 minutes are quite tricky they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat instead you will spend 83 minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization the lake was ridiculous looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed characters show their advanced teleportation powers for example alex thomas who falls into the lake drunk and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position angie harmon put up a pitiful performance as kate made worse by the space time continuum rupturing dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader an example of this would be when she said flashlight in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it snaps in half finally the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that i have ever seen it was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimps who had been given camcorders by scientists an example of this would be when we suddenly get a closeup of the headlight on alex's car i would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie the ending was absolutely pathetic the writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say oh yeah instead we're left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line unfortunately there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a festering piece of crap br br i give this a 5 out of 10 the 5 being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book,0
freeway killer is a madman who shoots people on the freeway while yelling a bunch of mystical chant on a car phone the police believe he is a random killer but sunny the blond heroine played by darlanne fluegel detects a pattern so does the ex cop played by james russo and they join forces and bodies in the search for the villain who has done away with their spouses also starring richard belzer this movie has its moments especially if you like car chases but its really not a good movie for the most part check it out if you're really bored and have already seen the hitcher joy ride or breakdown otherwise stay away from the freeway,0
eddie murphy spends his time looking for lost children so when a very special magical child is kidnapped in tibet the sexy charlotte lewis asks for his help to rescue this child from the clutches of evil itself br br although the story is a bit silly it never quite feels corny despite the hilarity of the comedy throughout the film charles dance off sets the comedy with his very serious and dark characterisation of the evil that holds the child hostage br br the golden child is very funny action packed and really quite compelling in a charming almost magical way br br 7 10 great for all generations,1
here's yet another film from the 80's that most people just don't know exists this slow picturesque the loving shots of the montana landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of costner's recent open range which also starred robert duval and emotionally satisfying film is the perfect type of movie to watch late one night when you can't sleep or on a listless sunday afternoon those in the right mood will be treated to a finely detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how they come back together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son while hunting the performances are all top notch and quietly nuanced glenn close robert duval and wilford brimley are pitch perfect in their portrayals as are all the supporting players and young actors i especially liked how director cain who unfortunately hasn't directed anything of note since this except the first young guns gives us quiet little glimpses into everyone's personal grief we don't just see how the death effects the younger brother or the parents but also the confused middle sister the wayward uncle his crazy wife and the dead teenager's girlfriend what we essentially get here is the rural mid western answer to ordinary people there's also shades of david lynch's the straight story in some of the stoic downhome mid west morality of the folks depicted here and also in the lovingly haunting shots of the farmland they inhabit this is one of the better and more realistic tear jerkers of the era and a nice little find for you quality movie hunters out there,1
br br so not being a poet myself i have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary the effortless motion of goldsworthy as he molds natures beauty into his own work is captivating watch him stick reeds together in a web hanging from a tree in a close up for a few minutes while he speaks of his work and then receive the payoff when the camera cuts to the wide shot be amazed by the ease with which he operates and then realize the futility when a slight breeze knocks down the entire web br br the genius of goldsworthy seemingly knows no bounds as his inspiration is nature itself it is in the essential change of nature where his work though complete in its own sphere is made whole,1
i watched this series when it first came out in the 70s i was 14 years old and i watched it at my best friends house as my dad didn't want to watch it it became a weekly ritual every sunday and as anyone will tell you for two fourteen year olds to watch a documentary in almost reverential silence must mean that this was something special br br the broad sweep of the events of world war 2 makes for a difficult subject to document so the makers broke it down into what they considered to be the most significant key happenings and devoted one episode to each some episodes covered long periods such as 'wolf pack' which covered nearly all six years of the battle of the atlantic while the battle of stalingrad had one episode to itself br br this documentary could not be made today quite simply because most of those interviewed are dead the list of significant players appearing gives an amazing insight into the thinking at the time anthony eden the foreign secretary carl donnitz head of the u boats albert speer pet architect confident and later armament minister for hitler in one of the later episodes we see traudl junge hitler's secretary who was with him in the bunker and it was to her that he dictated his last will and testament she left the bunker after hitler's suicide and escaped through the russian lines these and many others play a major role in the realism of the events portrayed br br if i have any criticism of the series it is that the code breakers of bletchly park are not included but the revelations of their part in the war only emerged after the series had been made so i cannot blame the programme makers br br the opening titles and music are magnificent and lawrence olivier's narration lends a natural gravity to the script br br the best documentary series ever made without doubt unmissable,1
i really liked this movie despite one scene that was pretty bad the one when samantha and nick are flirting in the hotel the story is so cool and can't wait to read the book bravo for the super station,1
i have been learning about the zodiac for four years now and i'm not saying i know much more than anyone else in fact out of most of the people who know and read and learn about z i am prolly the one with the least knowledge but i do know or at least i think i know that most of the stuff in this wouldn't happen from how he signed his name to how he killed people i thought that godfather was the worst film ever br br the cinematography was that of a five year old not saying that my films are any better but i am not someone who is making movies for the mass population br br the acting i thought for the most part was pretty good really i did the lead didn't talk that much on camera or at all i forget and don't know because i stopped watching his voice overs where good br br but really spend the four dollars and 70 cents on something else like a large pizza or something br br until i learn how to write a review psycho phil,0
i saw this in the summer of 1990 i'm still annoyed by how bad this movie is in 2001 br br implausible plot you'd have to be a child to think this could happen br br i'm just really annoyed by it don't see this,0
you can't imagine how i looked forward to king of the ants as a massive gordon fan i awaited the european premiere with wicked anticipation especially since i loved dagon gordon's last achievement so much king of the ants premiered here in my country and it was gordon himself who came to present it unfortunately i couldn't go and congratulate him for it afterwards king of the ants is his most uninspired and mediocre film to date really the quality level never surpassed ordinary tv thriller standards the plot outline is terribly routine and with the exception of a few poor scenes the typical gordon touch is never recognized on top of that the already weak script has more holes than a swiss bowl of cheese it involves a young wannabe crook who's hired to commit a murder so he does and of course they're not paying him and of course he falls in love with the victim's wife and of course he avenges himself only the sequences in which the guy descents in a spiral of madness are worth a mention and they're the only ones reminding you of the fact you're still watching a stuart gordon film the acting performances are below average with mccenna as the heroic lowlife george norm peterson' wendt as the chubby bastard and kari wuhrer as the good hearted sex bomb extremely illogical things happen constantly and the dullness of the story becomes irritating very quickly while the make up effects aren't enough to even satisfy amateur horror fans i read a few other comments on king of the ants claiming it's gordon's best since it finally is a thought provoking and mature film well if that's the case i rather stay immature and give re animator another viewing thank you very much oh well i guess every good director runs out of steam and inspiration eventually too bad it also overcame stuart gordon,0
if you want to make a movie like this have the threat be real don't surround your patsy with a bunch of bonzos there is no credibility here the plot is dull and unbelievable the acting is even worse i thought that i was watching arthur lake dagwood who is one of the worst actors in history when i saw the main character oh well at some point he has to face the music and get fighting mad i don't care do you there are all these long scenes set in this austere office the furniture made out of cardboard or masonite people talk and smoke and don't do anything most of the action happens in a five minute sequence after that it's over don't bother,0
obviously has some talent attached maria bello is always great but this is just a dreary wast of time portraying every character as someone to be loathed and exploited so someone could make a movie out of an 'interesting' story well i hope they got it out of their systems unfortunately for the audience there is no insight no sensitivity no context and really no humanity which would all be fine except it has no humor no horror no context and nothing constructive to say about the story it's trying to tell bad things happen you sit and watch it you don't care so what 99 of the time the words 'based on a true story' constitute an unintentional warning to the audience it means the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they heard about somewhere so they just throw them up on the screen and expect the 'true' nature of the story to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers having to do any of the work i hope they had a great time making this movie it stinks on ice,0
i have to agree with everyone else that has posted br br i watched it quite a while ago but i'll tell you whenever i hear certain music from this anime i am reminded of the story the beautiful animation the characters and the feeling i got when watching it and it does make me cry such a happy yet sad feeling i do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didn't explain things properly but it didn't ruin any part of the viewing experience br br i was into this anime so much that after the end i just had to do some research and watch the ending a few more times and i found all my answers and a whole lot more i love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more i've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime br br i do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely i'd recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story well built characters some mysterious and a bit of fantasy action br br also even though this was based on a h game it doesn't have any of that stuff in it and i actually prefer it this way i have no problem with mature anime in most cases i prefer it,1
i rarely write a negative review for this site but this time felt complied to night listener is without doubt one of the dullest films i have ever seen br br there was nothing happening in this film what so ever i didn't care for any of the characters didn't buy in to the whole mystery type plot didn't care how it ended nothing br br there is no comedy no action no thrills no suspense nothing the highlights include no spoilers there's nothing to spoil a man climbing through a window a dog barking outside a hotel room a car going over some rough ground and a truck beeping it's horn br br i really enjoyed one hour photo and hoped for a similar eerie role from williams but alas was sorely let down what's more disappointing is that i'm sure there is a good film in there somewhere the idea was interesting and i should have felt sympathy for the characters but it just didn't work for me br br i might even have given it 1 10 but that score is reserved for the remake of the producers,0
take a scifi original movie and mix in a little alternative revisionist history and you get aztec rex apparently hernand cortes before conquering the aztec empire had to first conquer a tyrannosaurus rex and her mate that's the thrust of this movie given the plot it could have really sucked the fact that it only kind of sucked is a tip of the cap to the writers there are a few problems for starters cortes is played by ian ziering even with a black wig ziering as cortes is about as convincing as axl rose playing gandhi and though cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of mexico the aztecs here seem to be played by an all hawaiian ensemble casting aside the t rex es look reasonably good though every time one of them gets shot it just oozed cgi and they die too easily i suppose if a t rex were around in real life they probably could be felled or at least wounded by some rather rudimentary 16th century weaponry but it takes something away from the movie there are also some graphic t rex swallowing human scenes which is surprising but in this context i thought they worked ok there's plenty of action and the whole colonization angle is prevalent throughout but doesn't overwhelm the dinosaur angle unlike the other recent scifi original dinosaur movie warbirds overall a mediocre but decent by scifi original standards movie that rates a modest 4,0
i didn't have many expectation going into the film but i thought it was fantastic pierce brosnan is outstanding in a very different role he has dumped the slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor pierce and greg kinnear play off each other great and make for one of the better buddy pairings in a long time the humor is dark the performances by brosnan kinnear and hope davis are great mix that with a touching element to the story about friendship and you have a great film this is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time this is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post bond era of brosnan's career,1
this woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling so she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer this movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope the problem i had with this movie is that every ten seconds someone is snorting heroin if they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin then this would be a pretty good movie every time i thought that a scene was going somewhere someone inhaled the white powder it was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie it pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer the lesbian stuff didn't bother me i was looking for a movie about art i found a movie about drug use,0
this bomb is just one 'explosion' after another with no humor and only absurd situations really pyrotechnics to the extreme reality is not one of its strong points i give it a 1 out of 10 i would have made it a zero but that option wasn't permitted sorry but lithgow and sutherland deserve better roles but then at times we all need to have money and i still recoil at that tim burton farce about mars nicholson was brave enough to admit that was a turkey but if that was a turkey this movie then is not even a gizzard i wish i could say give me back my money you can bet i would if i could but that is the trouble with premium services the subscription variety,0
i was so disturbed by the real footage at the beginning of the film that i felt sick to my stomach and ended up shutting the movie off how any can give this film more than a rating of 1 baffles me i know that the intent of the movie is to shock but showing actual footage of a dog that had been skinned alive holding back vomit as i type please i shut it off after the scene with the decomposing baby i had had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point no wonder this movie was found at the bargain bin in hmv i really have no desire to see any other movie by this uwe person anyone who enjoyed this needs therapy period,0
im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when i'm picking a film so i picked five across the eyes i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish i think i could of done better myself i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul,0
i didn't mind the film that much but it was incredibly dull and boring a few laughs here and there but nothing to go crazy for br br you should give it a go if you like silly stupid humour because this is the film for you,0
this is a very good movie do you want to know the real reasons why so many here are knocking this movie i will tell you in this movie you have a black criminal who outwits a white professor a black cop who tells the white professor he is wrong for defending the black criminal and the black cop turns out to be right thus making the white professor look stupid it always comes down to race this is an excellent movie pay no attention to the racist if you can get over that there are characters who are played by blacks in this movie who outsmart the white characters then you shouldn't have any problems enjoying this movie i recommended everyone to go see this movie,1
indian summer is a good film it made me feel good and i thought the cast was exceptional how about sam raimi playing the camp buffoon i thought his scenes were very funny in a buster keaton like performance solid directing and nice cinematography,1
this was in short a terrible disappointment by far the worst adaptation of one of my favourite novels the dialogue was horribly clumsy i could sense no feeling behind the words expressed by the characters the lines were delivered too hastily and felt rather out of place they could just as well have been cited by statues the chemistry between george c scott and susannah york was non existent and watching an american rochester felt strange he could have at least tried to do a british accent i like george c scott as an actor but this simply did not work i felt like i was watching highlights from jane eyre where the main pieces of the story had been randomly put together with no regard to the flow of the story the scenery and music were all very nice but i could feel none of the passion and love that is supposed to be between jane and rochester and the movie left me totally unmoved br br if you want to see a good version of jane eyre i suggest you watch the 1983 bbc version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke or the 1997 version with ciarán hinds and samantha morton now these two are brilliant adaptations,0
this is just the best movie of all times sorry hollywood i've seen it in early 70's as soon as it appeared on the bulgarian tv and i loved it immediately i was 14 then 25 years later i bought it on a video tape and a few months ago it finally appeared on a dvd here in bulgaria i live with this movie 35 years already and so do all my friends and my family my son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time and he loved it immediately too and this is the generation that grew up watching practically only hollywood movies and not speaking or understanding russian at all what makes this masterpiece of danelia so special it's difficult to say as it is difficult to describe what the beauty is but the fact is that you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as it was the first time i can't remember any other such movie no matter how many millions it cost or how great the cast was chapeau maestro danelia bulgaria loves you,1
four great stories from master robert bloch adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early seventies are the base of this excellent amicus' production this was a kind of movie very popular in the sixties till the mid seventies and it's one of my favorite type of horror movies this one in particular shines for the episode sweets to the sweet where christopher lee is stalked by his evil little girl child heiress to her mother tradition great fun from start to finish and good to very good are also the other three episodes with the last one a bit on the comic side but with the great addition of ingrid pitt the most famous vampress of the english cinema,1
camp with a capital c think of mask and the ace ventura movies then multiply by 100 this laugh a minute entertainer takes schlock to the level of high art david dhawan is a genius and govinda is beyond description see it over and over again i insist,1
gotta start with ed furlong on this one you gotta god bless this kid 5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he's really like in real life he has a one liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn't even seem like furlong is even acting maybe that's why his performance was good same with madsen you keep thinking i bet this guy is really like this in real life does madsen even have to act just natural vosloo has obviously moved on from the type casted mummy guy i think the biggest surprise to this film was jordana spiro's performance her reactions are spot on in this film i battled if she was hot or not but realized i would just like to see more of her br br not a big fan of shoot 'em out hostage type films but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing it's not just your standard robbers take over a bank they kill hostages and the good guys win in the end type of film the twists keep on coming and coming br br the café scenes work best with the hand held cams to show what it's really like in there not glossed over a bit think like bourne ultimatum lite style on some scenes in the café br br and for those bo bice fanatics out there actor curtis wayne who plays karl will make you do a double take these guys are twins br br as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countries states so they might have these accents but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of and some of them are smoking hot moncia dean need i say more,1
who what where when why the acting was terrible very robotic rehearsed i have seen all of the actors in this film in better roles the screenplay was very elementary by the end of this film the story line was tied up and jeane claude lamarre should be tied up too so that he never attempts to write direct another film,0
an average tv movie quality totally formula story of religious fanatic ron perlman who gives good i'm not just the president of 'psychos r us ' i'm also a client who gets control of a biochemical virus think the virus from the movie the rock too bad for him that he also gets stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank robbers and the government agents trying to stop him led by the impressively physiqued mildly entertaining wolf larson backed by fred dryer along with the standard in the wrong place at the wrong time spunky female the forever bland erika eleniak and lived as a wimp but died as a hero at the last minute male brandon karrer has the standard background story to give sympathy to the religious fanatic wife and son killed in a police raid a few years previous br br basically a decent rainy day movie br br favorite line spoken by ron perlman after he finds the vial of the virus hidden in erika eleniak's cleavage a woman and her mystery br br worth a rent,0
terry gilliam's stunning feature length adaptation of chris marker's short film la jetee is full of mind bending surprises yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast gilliam's flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by david and janet peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor james cole willis at his most steve mcqueen like better than mcqueen even a time traveling convict from the future who literally doesn't know whether he's coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals willis the justifiably oscar nominated brad pitt and madeline stowe as a well meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers even paul buckmaster's tango style score is haunting this one's a don't miss,1
where to start this movie started badly and ended badly it consists of extremely poor acting and unrealistic effects that had me cringing in my seat seriously my cat could have acted better than this lot br br some of it was actually laughable because it was so unbelievable i would of rated this lower but they haven't got anything else so heed my warning and unless your so bored your close to suicide and would like a good reason to continue with your suicide mission don't bother with this one i'm still in shock that this could actually be released to the public this should be a crime and all involved should be arrested i gather you've got the gist by now so i'll leave it up to you to decide,0
this is definitely not one of lucio fulci's better flicks by any stretch of the imagination the plot is pretty bad a millionaire is murdered and his spirt calls upon his daughter to find out who did it but the biggest problem i have with this besides knowing who killed him within 10 minutes of watching the movie was wondering why anyone should even care the father comes off as being a really big jerk to everyone he came across including the daughter who he asks to help him which made it quite hard for anyone to care who killed him but no one really watches a fulci flick for a good storyline to do so would be like watching a porn for incredible script writing and acting typically his movies try to compensate for this by adding excessive scenes of gore but even that is lacking in this movie if you're looking for a good fulci flick check out the beyond,0
we as a family were so delighted with 'the last of the blonde bombshells' we purchased a copy for our home video library br br the acting is a1 and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers the theme is unusual and the script well written the music songs are timeless and takes us back to our young days when we sang the songs at the top of our voices to outline the story here would spoil the 'plot' as it is really nice to sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds br br full marks to this most enjoyable and uplifting production and we heartily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a belly laugh and lots of music,1
a comedy gem lots of laugh out loud moments the shop and pub scenes had me belly laughing uncontrollably the characters are recognisable and the dialogue well observed i know people like this the humour is surprisingly gentle and the film this may sound strange puts me in mind of an ealing comedy it's a quirky little film with lots of detail it certainly takes a number of viewings i've watched it a few times i've been showing all my friends and notice something new each time a bit of dialogue something visual that i hadn't picked up on before i could get really picky and find a couple of shortcomings in the film but i'm not going to because overall this is a great fun feel good film which is really worth a watch and which anyone with a sense of humour must enjoy it is a film which will find it's friends and i hope there are a lot of them out there oh and it has a great soundtrack,1
i recently started watching this show and i have to say that it really made me laugh you have to appreciate the unrealistic aspects of it along with everything else some other people said this show should have more realistic reactions of the dead among other things if you are going accept that ned can bring the dead back to life you have to accept that the other completely crazy bits of the show i couldn't help smiling after every episode i watched i really think it's great there is a show out there that can take a very strange subject and really make it great to watch i absolutely love the narration i think it adds that extra bit of wonder to the whole show you can't always compare old shows by a writer to his new ones you have to take everything as it's own entity definitely give it a chance and just enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are,1
i saw this movie on a westbound american airlines flight it was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer the plot had potential who wouldn't love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every elvis impersonator she meets but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky thinking he's going to return then a group of stars moves together to form an elvis constellation which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonators sending them crashing through the roof bad really bad which is the theme for the whole movie i'd avoid this one at all costs,0
black guy becomes rich white guy and rich white guy seems to embrace hip hop culture and most of the funny moments of this film play off of this the problem i have is that it doesn't work and almost never works br br ok so no one would expect lance to grab a body like that and suddenly start acting like charles wellington that would be too much to ask i'll grant that but at the same time it goes too far the other direction i'm supposed to imagine a rich white guy singing rap and completely upending things playing like he's a bastion of hip hop culture and people just accept him and what about sontee who falls in love with him as a rich white guy even though she doesn't care about his money or power this is so completely unbelievable it's not even funny br br i just couldn't suspend disbelief and i couldn't finish the movie i added one extra star because it did make me laugh even hard a couple of times but i just couldn't get get past the whole white guy doing hip hop thing that has never been well done in any movie i've ever seen that tries it this was no exception,0
when i saw birthday girl i liked it so much i set out to see every nicole kidman film i could only to find all of them a disappointment compared to it i theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control with nicole kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to film enjoyment imho thus for instance dogville even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is hammering home or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone else's attention or other pet causes of kidman's br br here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job i don't how or who was able to restrain her but apparently it worked the way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman and consequently what makes a man's most desperate hopes marginally attainable br br of course the fact the male lead transforms from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy but his transformation is adequately believable it isn't coyly contrived as it would be in a film engineered to bolster male ego instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances br br also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human apart from their criminal mission her gang has a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to american culture and while they are his adversaries they are never really his enemy in effect they teach him to be compete br br i really marveled at kidman's ability to physically appear russian it had me wondering whether her ancestry was russian but none of the photos of her i examined showed any hint of it maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing br br i can only hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out another great film despite my gratuitous digs at ms kidman the message is this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a lifetime,1
this movie is brilliant in every way it touches on the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way but never lectures the script never condescends toward any character not even the hapless johnny it also and benefits from spot on direction production design casting and performances the fact that cher is so perfect in the film and is more unlike cher than she has ever been is a wonder to me i watch moonstruck at least once a year and i just viewed it again this christmas eve with my 16 year old twin daughters and they loved it as well it has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end,1
a good film with strong performances especially the two leads the film is about two american girls who are caught with 6 kilo's heroin on an airport in thailand they're both thrown in prison and one of them signs a confession bill pullman plays the lawyer who tries to get them out all they have to do is find a nick parks who put the narcotics in the bag of one of the two girls so far for the story which isn't that original it has many resemblances with the better return to paradise br br the acting and newton thomas sigel's beautiful photography make this film worth to watch a 7 out of 10,1
my mom and i have just recently become addicted to this show laughing our butts off i've only seen about 10 episodes and i am disappointed that i didn't pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled the story line is very funny the characters really have great personalities or not so great but they're still funny i tivo every episode of what i like about you amanda bynes and jennie garth as well as all of the cast never leave me bored while watching there is some unsuitable language for children and some sexual content but with a parental guide near you shouldn't have too much problems there is some sort of 'friends' type of relationship that attracts me to this show i really enjoy it,1
i rented this film to see what might be a bloody non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action drama that makes kickboxer look like die hard lou and reb are in vietnam and as lou saves reb from the gooks he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever the vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard i swear lou is now brain damaged and reb and him live together and own a bar super homoerotic lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and reb goes on a killing spree to get him back there is no good fight scenes at all the punches are two inches away from a person characters personalities change in matter of seconds one guy is a bad and in the next scene he's good the acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental frank stallone sounding song that would make you sick i hated this film,0
has al pacino ever been in a bad movie his name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema this is as good a performance as he's ever given pacino is an american olivier and this is a political thriller as good as they get there are no good guys and no bad guys but the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it not only is pacino's performance compelling the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is awesomely powerful the film has a fast paced gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks this outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence overheated sex or gutter language there is murder there are bad people but they come across effectively without crossing the line a film like this restores my jaded faith in hollywood i don't award many tens this one richly deserves it,1
this film is really bad so bad that even christopher lee cannot save it a poor story an even poorer script and just plain bad direction makes this a truly outstanding horror film the outstanding part being that it is the only horror film that i can honestly say i would never ever watch again this garbage make plan nine from outerspace look like oscar material,0
while it contains facts that are not widely reported it is not exactly the truth they took a lot of liberties in rearranging events excluding people and using sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the 30's there were more than just bonnie clyde and w d in the gang at various times and those people had as much to do with the facts as those included buck and blanche went to convince clyde to go straight much earlier than the one shootout and in fact got drawn back into crime some of the events that were portrayed in daylight actually took place at night bonnie's wound was much more severe and never healed right it was so bad she had to be carried around by someone until it healed up and even then it stiffened up so she walked stiffly clyde also walked with a limp because while in prison he cut off a big toe i know i'm being nit picky and it was a tv movie but even without these factual errors in this true story the movie moves too fast from event to event and comes across more as several separate snapshots of their lives rather than being a cohesive flowing story br br i'd recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth,0
i am not a big fan of rajnikant in the first place but baba was a huge disappointment in between an awful storyline the action and songs were only mediocre the storyline becomes very preachy instead of running for office like ntr or mgr rajni almost appeared to be running as tamil nadu's next big guru my wife tells me that since this film came out rajni swore off doing any more movies br br we were lucky initially to have bought babu an oldie by sivajiganeshan online by accident when trying to buy this one that was a great film which made up for having bought this dud except it makes baba look even worse by comparison br br bryan,0
most people miss hollywood's point of concept if a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child within the confines of the law then i approve of the lessons being taught by doc savage br br in all times of conflict or war the public and government look for heroes to decorate the motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with such as doc savage james bond superman batman spiderman and others doc savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the 'best of the best' before james bond superman or any of the others all others that follow doc savage are only a part of the character not the 'man of bronze',1
it seems that salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie some of it is a very weak thriller and i say very very weak some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters both things have been tried in psychological thrillers but in this case the movie cannot hold things together due to poor superficial scripting bad acting and a too dark too dull cinematography i'd say that salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot on the whole a b movie hardly worth your money vote 4 10,0
every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie how great will be my joy br br where to begin my discussion of pain for starters there was a musical montage every five minutes there was no character development every character was a stereotype we had swearing guy fat guy who eats donuts goofy foreign guy etc the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation have the directors producers etc ever even seen a movie before halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry the concept for this movie sounded so funny how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors but trust me when i say this things went wrong very wrong,0
the whole does not even come close to the sum of the parts no problem this film features a line up of some of the most diversely creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast the segments are devised around the same theme love in paris but the resemblance ends there actually considering that the approach to the theme from all these different directors takes so many forms it is amazing that we can even feel we are still watching the same film no great effort has been made to turn it into a comprehensive whole this buffet has so many great ingredients i am glad nobody tried to put them all in a single dish,1
this is one of my favorite family movies loved it when i was little and it still holds up with me now that i'm older i still laugh at all the same old jokes and might even shed a tear a times i never have much cared for animals talking or at least un animated ones but this one i'll stand up for it's a pretty old movie but it will always hold a place in my heart br br there aren't any other live animal movies that i can think of at the moment that i even could compare with let alone like as much as this one i might be giving too much praise to this movie but i don't think show i really holds that great message that home is where the heart is or at least that's the message i gained from it definitely recommended for a good old family movie night,1
whoa in the twin cities we have a station that shows a big bad movie monday through friday tonight's nugget was a film with carrie fisher called she's back about a really annoying woman who ends up getting murdered when thugs break into her house bea beatrice comes back to haunt her husband she wants him to seek revenge on her killers hence she's back and she won't let him rest until he does so she irritates him endlessly and the viewers too this movie is truly one of the worst movies i've ever seen hey i like bad movies though my fave movie is xanadu i was really shaking my head throughout the whole film wondering who thought this would be a good idea for a movie bea is just so annoying the plot is silly the acting is bad the story well you get my drift anyway if you wanna see a really bad movie really really bad movie check this one out you won't be disappointed heh,0
along with patrick mcgoohan and robert culp jack cassidy was an iconic columbo villain the very first proper episode of columbo following two standalone pilots murder by the book is not far off classic status br br jack cassidy plays ken franklin one half of a murder mystery writing partnership his partner jim is the talented one whereas ken has no talent other than the gift of the gab and a skill for promoting the books as soon as jim has decided he no longer requires ken's marketing skills ken hatches a plot to kill jim except it's not a new plot it's actually the implementation in real life of a murder storyline originally intended for one of their books br br it doesn't take columbo long to work out that ken is the murderer although unfortunately another murder has to take place ken romances and then kills a key witness before columbo has enough evidence to secure a conviction br br nothing whatsoever wrong with murder by the book but it's not quite top notch i would just give publish or perish the edge over this both episodes feature jack cassidy and the world of publishing but publish or perish is a fraction more tense and unpredictable but this is still a great episode,1
diego armando maradona was and still remains as the best football player the game has offered not just an athlete but an artist this documetary if the 1986 world cup will forever live in the memories of every football fan around the world because of his tremendous and unbelievable goal which he scored against my own country england there's absolutely no point of diminishing this star although i dont undersand spanish i can appreciate the argentine narrator he actually cries of happiness and can barely express his emotion anything i wrote can be senseless and difficult to comprehend but readers you have to watch this to know what i mean,1
be warned this movie is such a mess it's a catastrophe don't waste your time with this one i warned you br br the acting story dialogue music basically everything is so over the top it's absolutely annoying and ridiculous it made me want to throw up if the dialogue acting story wasn't doing it it's everyone being shot crooked you'll feel like you're watching a comedy the problem is the parts that are supposedly funny isn't even funny the acting story cinematography you can feel everything is just trying waaaay too hard but it never succeeds practically every shot is canted but so what this movie just feels like a student film no wonder they shot this in hd because it would be a waste to spend more money to shoot this on film br br if you're easily amused or like poor acting writing editing directing full of clichés everything that's forced in your face oh and did i mention poor acting well actually it's not all the actor's fault it's the director then i guess you'll like this movie br br i had to watch this for a class i would have turned it off right away if i could if you still can't tell by now i hated this movie it made me want to throw up and get my time back at least i didn't have to pay for this garbage br br jeff goldblum you know the guy from jurassic park independence day is in this movie but he sure went downhill from then accepting roles for movies like this catastrophe,0
the film of artemisia may be considered treason or as true artistic license br br which might one aver br br in documented history artemisia gentileschi was subjected to the thumbscrew and still affirmed that she was r ed as mary garrard and gloria steinem have eloquently affirmed br br in the movie under a different torture she refused to condemn her lover violator br br how may a movie deviate so much from received history yet still inform the human heart br br the answer is not so hard to find in the movie the director and cast had filled a gaping hole in the historical record with the power of imagination br br that led to a conclusion that differs from the record br br so be it i find both the record and the movie to be compelling br br in both the movie and it seems in history artemisia was a painter before all else br br for that vision framed in ravishing sic film composition i am truly grateful br br seldom have i seen a movie that so compelled my eyes br br david broadhurst,1
i'm a don johnson fan but this is undoubtedly the worst movie done by anybody that i've ever seen the acting was bad as was the cinematography don should stick to doing action because as the king he just didn't cut it,0
boy girl love affair sequel with songs only this time she's the punkette and he's the straight arrow movie buffs out there actually like this movie it has fans i must say the mind reels grease 2 is a truly lame enterprise that doesn't even have the courage moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames like jaws 2 or exorcist ii no it whimpers along in slow motion and often just plays dead it looks and feels cheap with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling this was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of michelle pfeiffer and although she doesn't embarrass herself it's a role worth forgetting a misfire on the lowest of levels no stars from,0
the long list of big names in this flick including the ubiquitous john mills didn't bowl me over to the extent that i couldn't judge the film on its actual merits it is full of stereotypes caricatures and standard set scenes from the humble air ace hero to the loud mouthed yank flyer the music track was such that at one point about an hour before the end i thought the film was over loud rising crescendo grand flourish and finish then silence but then the movie continued i found no real storyline haphazard writing but smartly pressed uniforms and the pretty jean simmons pre nose job with a rousing little ditty i cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great i found it maudlin mawkish and minor,0
i saw only the first part of this series when it debuted back in the late 90's and only recently got a chance to watch all three parts via netflix convenient service by the way all in all i liked this lighthearted sometimes genre challenged mini series the story of a younger man falling for an older woman seems to work and the actors are all fine yes it does have some romance clichés of running in the rain or a train station goodbye but the characters have a chance to be explored so it doesn't seem cheesy like it would be if this were some tom hanks vehicle or similar robson greene who at times reminds me of a separated at birth scott bakula does a fine job of someone who is head over heels in love and the ebb and tide of desire and rejection throws the series into watchable fare personally i think the series could have been done with two episodes but that's up for debate i suppose apparently there's a sequel and that should be arriving tomorrow via netflix,1
first of all this movie starts out on a really dumb note a 10 year old girl playing around in a moving vehicle decides it would be funny to cover up her mom's eyes with her hands and then causes a horrific accident which kills the mom duh i am sorry there is positively no 10 year old that dumb the rest of the movie does not get much better after the death of the mother by the apparent dumbest 10 year old on the planet the dad moves the family to genova italy where he is to teach at a local university but here is the clincher he does not speak a word of italian then the little girl has visions of mommy who she killed and often subsequent night terrors which always always end by the father holding and coddling her then we are forced to watch this family continually get lost and then found and then hug and then cry and lost and then found followed by of course more hugging and crying to the point that i was actually wishing for some sort of natural disaster to just wipe all of these vapid ignorant people off the planet do not get me wrong because i love indies but an indie about dumb people and i mean really dumb is simply ridiculous and pointless it is really a shame that this movie was based on such insipid characters wallowing in such retarded scenarios because the locale was interesting,0
most people who have seen this movie thinks that it is the best movie ever made i disagree but this movie is very very good tony is a bad ass guy and knows that he's intimidating and uses it to get ahead it's about him and how he goes from washing dishes to having a huge house and a office with cocaine all over the desk if you want a family movie then this isn't the way to go but if you want mobsters and vengeance and stuff like that then you'll like it,1
after having seen and loved postal yes i actually loved postal i decided to try another uwe boll film and i picked out seed because i happened to stumble on it in a local dvd store and it's supposed to be one of his better films br br while the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too mainstream psychological thriller it soon went downhill from there and eventually degraded into one of the most generic slasher films i've seen so far including a massive amount of plot holes unrealistic emotional responses and sub par acting it seems like boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot but after a while just gave up on it maybe he should stick to comedy the few good things about this film is that he does manage to create an overall creepy atmosphere that the special effects are better than i expected and the soundtrack does go well with the overall atmosphere but the unbalanced pacing of this film combined with the utter generic nature thereof makes he last half hour quite tedious to watch which ruined my experience altogether there are a very fairly well done shocking scenes but they seem to be there for the shock value alone and let's not forget the camera work that was pretty nauseating at times br br i hope uwe boll will one day learn what makes a good film because between a lot of horrible films he does seem to make a decent film every now and then seed just isn't one of those,0
nicole kidman is a wonderful actress and here she's great i really liked ben chaplin in the thin red line and he is very good here too this is not great cinema but i was most entertained given most films these days this is high praise indeed,1
why am i so convinced there's actually another film version of this novel out there somewhere i saw the film again this year as i am teaching the novel and find the changes in the film annoying there is no appearance of the little boy in the novel and the ending has been changed they kill him off in the film but the whole point is that he is haunted by the events at eel marsh house for many years but does remarry and eventually put the events behind him mr bentley is a far more sympathetic character in the novel the scene in the film where kipps sets fire to the office is plain daft and the constant appearance of the toy soldier to signify the presence of the child is genuinely creepy but pointless kipps is haunted by the woman seeking revenge not the child i am sure i've seen a film which is better and closer to the novel and actually scarier have i just imagined this,1
start of with the good bit several times swayze talks zulu to his friends or that language is heard among the tribes that's a great plus as normally usa uk movie audiences think all people on this planet speak english just in case you're one of them no they don't br br but the acting is 'tenenkrommend' as we say in the netherlands it makes your toes curl and not in a good way i like swayze but in this he's awful the muscles in his jaws make overtime and he's frowning the whole movie some one must have told him it looks butch no patrick it looks silly and is compensation for lack of character alison doody elizabeth has opted for a style of acting that does not meet the style of her co workers her acting is só relaxed that this movie could have been set in the current days and it's not your frock was a clue alison br br the best acting came from the people from the african continent and sided onyulo as umbopa i liked best clear warm and in character his performance is a joy to watch br br general it is mwah entertaining on a rainy day pity could have been better sack the director,0
i had some time to kill before watching football so i saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it i thought i had encountered my version of mentally walking the bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the mummy series and jurassic park it was so bad that i thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup the acting was so bad that i was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end the lead by casper van dien made me long for the high caliber acting of steven seagal in on deadly ground as his line reading was so wooden that woody woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder i also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that i was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat the direction was so abysmal i looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage the fx of the movie was so bad that i thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade z horror flicks from yesteryear what robert wagner tom bosley and geoffrey lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie my warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your iq to diminish with prolonged viewing on a side note i noticed at imdb that sometimes salaries for movies are published i was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies beware and be safe avoid at all costs,0
absolutely stunning warmth for the head and the heart the kind of movie western movie makers are too rushed too frenetic to even attempt my kids watched it and they loved it too what real people goes to show you how cultural differences the japanese setting is less important than the human similarities go see it whether you like dancing or not,1
i thought this movie did a down right good job it wasn't as creative or original as the first but who was expecting it to be it was a whole lotta fun the more i think about it the more i like it and when it comes out on dvd i'm going to pay the money for it very proudly every last cent sharon stone is great she always is even if her movie is horrible catwoman but this movie isn't this is one of those movies that will be underrated for its lifetime and it will probably become a classic in like 20 yrs don't wait for it to be a classic watch it now and enjoy it don't expect a masterpiece or something thats gripping and soul touching just allow yourself to get out of your life and get yourself involved in theirs br br all in all this movie is entertaining and i recommend people who haven't seen it see it because what the critics and box office say doesn't always count see it for yourself you never know you might just enjoy it i tip my hat to this movie br br 8 10,1
ok let me say that i didn't expect a film starring jerry springer to be cinematic gold all i asked for was it to be cinematic and it wasn't even that it looked like someone's bad home movies poorly acted scripted and filled to the brim with nudity of the most unnattractive people i've ever seen br br the film's plot focuses on a low class family who decide to go on the jerry farrelly show to discuss multiple affairs between a mother daughter stepfather and the daughter's fiancee from there the movie fizzles and develops into a unique experience white trash pornography there's redneck sex interacial sex even sex between jerry and his wife yuk this film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision at least it was mercifully short disgusting and degrading african americans and working class america should be offended howard stern should be pleased however he didn't squander his attempt for film stardom his was smart funny and entertaining br br my grade f the daughter was hot,0
the life and time of little richard as told by little richard as produced and directed by little richard was about as one sided as one of his songs this is not a biography or even a docudrama but does have good writing great energy and an outstanding leading actor playing richard all the music is by little richard so it rocks a tight lipsync on every song br br the movie covers his early childhood carrys thru the formative years in music the wild success and richard's throwing it all away to praise the lord its all tied together well and the obvious comeback in 1962 manages to stay away from the idea that little richard discovered the beatles whom opened for him br br my main objection is that his outrageous counter cultural behavior is underplayed and you get no feel for how his audience experienced him at that time some of his energy which he still has does not come across full force he seemed tame compared to what i remember of him at the time br br the best scenes are richard getting jilted by lucille and writing a song about it and the strip to bikini shorts while performing to make the point about not having a decent place to change br br if they had gotten into the bronze liberace as richard use to refer to himself in interviews then there's a story trust me i just saw him perform a couple of months ago and he still flirts with the pretty white boys giving the one particularly good dancer in the audience his headband nearly 68 and still going strong i recommend this movie and any concert or t v appearance you can find little richard is always on,1
this show is so full of action and everything needed to make an awsome show but best of all it actually has a plot unlike some of those new reality shows it is about a transgenic girl who escapes from her military holding base i totally suggest bying the dvds i've already preordered them i suggest you do to,1
what an absolutely stunning movie if you have 2 5 hrs to kill watch it you won't regret it it's too much fun rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn't anything more other than him i still liked it the music by a r rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it,1
what a great movie this is so reminiscent of the wonderful disney classic family movies of the 60's and the 70's i was so pleasantly surprised after the past 20 years of absolute detritus disney's live productions crews have churned out br br this movie is an absolute joy the child stars were just that professional quality actors i am most impressed with the quality of this movie br br sigourney weaver was a total sycophantic insert hyperbole here running a prison camp for wayward boys siobhan fallon was wonderful as the star's mother br br i won't recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again but the story is wonderful the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was superb this work reminds you what it's like to be a child without going all sugary or being too grim the deleted scenes featured on the dvd version were truly best left deleted they were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it while the abuse was hinted in the finished product it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent it was best that way br br this was an absolutely delightful movie to watch br br it gets a 9 10 from br br the fiend,1
quick and simple i love this movie br br as some others have mentioned i also am not from the south don't really care for country music and have never worn a cowboy hat i've never drove around in a car with a dead body in my trunk either but i love goodfellas this is just great film making shot in a 2 35 aspect ratio and beautifully transfered to dvd the vhs was 1 33 full screen and yes a solid 5 1 mix for your viewing pleasure what can you say about this movie br br it's just a great love hate story set in texas with great performances travolta is fantastic next to pulp fiction it's the best thing he's done it's been in my top 5 for 25 years br br check this one out it's a 10,1
jerry spies tom listening to a creepy story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his nemesis br br i didn't find this particular episode that funny the humour seemed rather constrained and the whole set up was kinda lame jerry is essentially the 'bad guy' in this one tormenting poor tom for no particular reason br br there is the occasional flash of inspiration such as tom's literal 'heart in mouth' experience and the moment when his nines lives are sucked out of his body but on the whole this effort lacks the frenetic pacing excellent animation and sheer wit of most of t j's other cartoons,0
i will stat of with the plot alice having survived the previous instalment of the nightmare series finds the deadly dreams of freddy krueger starting once again this time the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of alice's unborn child his intention is to be born again into the real world the only one who can stop freddy is his dead mother but can alice free her spirit in time to save her own son this movie did start of really well as we see alice dreaming of being amanda kruger who get stuck in room and get raped by 100 manics then she being rushed to hospital but then she not longer the pregnant lady but then she amanda giving birth to freddy again br br alice and dan are the only two people to return from the 4th movie and then have gotten some new friends its' no long before freddy start to kill again i did like the first dead it okay not as good as the other deaths or dreams br br freddy himself didn't seem to be scary in this movie at all the nightmare were just boring really they were not scary or creepy at all br br acting in movies was okay for a 5th movie in the series but overall i think this movie was really dull still not worst movie of the series freddy dead is the worst br br 4 10,0
shamefull as it may be this movie actually made it to the videomarket bringing shame on my proud country any attempt to watch this movie without stopping or pausing will be a fruitless attempt one cannot bear to see more than one hour of this then having either fallen asleep or visited the bathroom for puking br br note if you haven't seen anything else from denmark please remember this br br some things were never meant to be but still some idiot goes ahead and makes it anyway,0
got to be one of the best political satires i have seen to date with an excellent performance for cusak tomei and all the supporting actors br br excellent plot very well placed and a very good unexpected twist at the end the action scenes were well filmed choreographed very funny br br all in all i give this film a big thumbs up it's extremely critical of us military intervention in the middle east and as such it may receive bad reviews from people who don't share the same political view or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and drk humour indeed at places the comedy was so close to the truth that it was borderline between funny and tragic,1
what was the deal with the clothes they were all dressed like something out of the late 70's early 80s the cars were even were outdated the school was outdated the nuns attire was outdated and the hospital looked like something from the 40's with its wards and wooden staircases and things nothing in the whole movie implied it took place in 1991 my mother was laughing saying geeeee od when was this movie made when we pressed the info button on our remote we were sure 1991 had to be typo did anybody else notice this my favorite part though was when the woman tells her uppity muck husband on the telephone about the inverted cross in the mirror and he just says well look i've got a congress meeting i'll talk to you about it later that line was just classic just like a man my mothers favorite part was when they gave the spawn of the devil child her very own rottweiler my mother said just what the spawn of the devil needs a rottweiler she also enjoyed all of the people collapsing in the churches clutching their chests her other favorite part was the guy at the school parking lot driving 5 miles a hour driving right into the garbage truck dump truck front end loader thingee he had about 20 seconds to just stop the car but he just kept going with a real dumb vacant look on his face i mean how fast can you go in a school parking lot whatever,0
the biggest reason i had to see this movie was that it stars susan swift an outstanding and all too underappreciated actress time travel movies usually don't interest me and neither do movies about witchcraft but this movie was fascinating and creepy it didn't rely on outrageous special effects and it didn't focus so heavily on the time travel that the viewer gets lost and confused this was a really creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all,1
hidden frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best star trek stories and to providing an example of the togetherness that was gene roddenberry's mission their focus on homosexuality depression war and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds those of the other trek series and movies the production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the 7 seasons of production the acting has improved the stories are more complex and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive in season 6 episode 1 countermeasures there is one of the biggest space battles in trek history the ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting the real draw to frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters there are also nods to other trek series and movies with places and characters we all know i recommend any trek fan to check out countermeasures and you will be hooked,1
i saw this film at the santa barbara film festival and there was not a dry eye in the house it is incredible to see not only what a great person darius is but how admirable the rest of the team is too and at such a young age br br it also made me think how disgusting mtv was and how on being given an opportunity to involve and inspire in a positive way they declined shows you whether they really care about the youth and their viewers at all br br it's a wonderful and heart warming true story take your tissues but it's great to see how caring and inspiring youth of today can be,1
kiera nightly moved straight from the p p set to this action movie she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically a great success in love actually and as lizie in jane austen's classic she is once again having a go just as her bikini clad warrier woman in king arthur was more skin than muscle it is difficult to imagine this delicate frame standing up to a bounty hunters life but then this is exactly what domino harvey the real one did and i being one of nightly's biggest fans believe she carries if off br br stuff br br 90210 for the non american world is the post code of beverly hills in la where all the film stars live domino harvey father's mostfamous film was manchurian candidate which appears in the film domino harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the film came out in june 2005 after having been arrested for drug dealing she had just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be inlcuded in the film kiera knightly alludes to domino harvey's sexuality in her interview with lucy liu br br if you find this film a bit far fetched then check out domino harvey as the facts are more amazing than the fiction,1
tobe hooper has made great movies so i was certain this couldn't be bad i didn't read any reviews and tried to watch this unintentionally humorous film at times this made me laugh sometimes i almost fell asleep sometimes made me almost cry for hooper br br i rated this 3 10 because its 1990 horror movie and many interesting or funny things happened there throughout the movie i was thinking something like they simply can't add more things in this movie but they did br br some tell this is some sort of firestarter clone but truly isn't it's based on that idea but thats all this is combination of horror comedy weird religion god things funny gore simple effects drama horrible acting unbelievable script and more br br spoilers story is government tries to create ultimate weapon using nuclear power or something and fails during process child is born for 2 test persons when mom sings to her child after the birth both husband and wife burns and it is spontaneous combustion government buries whole thing and leaves this child live amongst other people and then after x years this kid is grown up and realizes he has been born for a reason and whoa he can burn things with his brains then everything goes unbelievable messy nothing really explains anything and well when the government realizes okay now he can set this fire thing to work they take him to normal hospital where is some nuclear toxic what they are going to use on this man because they could kill him no they can't shoot him no and argh i guess thats enough to tell i promise there is 100 more weird things in this movie br br well if you want good laughs watch this one gosh,0
this is a romantic comedy where albert einstein played wonderfully by walter matthau and his cronies play match maker to his niece meg ryan and a talented auto mechanic tim robbins the interplay among these major roles is augmented by a terrific supporting cast of well recognized character actors this movie is cute and fun a feel gooder hearty recommendations,1
however i am not one of them caro diario at least was watchable for two thirds of the time but the boring and self centred third section of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinarily self indulgent mess moretti says he feels a need to make this movie but doesn't want to whereas the viewer feels that he should stick with it but really doesn't want to either a film about italian politics and elections could be fascinating but this is not that film at one point moretti and his friends are standing outside the communist party headquarters discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with party leaders inside but it's characteristic of this film that we never get to see anything of them interposed with moretti's political ravings are the events leading up to the birth of his son and subsequent home movie shots of him with the baby and later the infant pietro the film drags us through several years and more than one election period we keep expecting to see some definitive sequence or cogent argument but they never come i for one doubt that i could have the patience to ever sit through a nanni moretti movie again he succeeds in making an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity,0
this movie was amusing at times hell sometimes it was even downright funny br br the underlying message i got from the film though was that women are responsible for all of the troubles of man every time a woman is depicted in the film she is being lazy being slutty or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason i don't think the message involved is good for women or gay men br br but it is a comedy and a piece of art so it is simply someones point of view even if i don't agree with it they are still entitled to it br br an amusing film but some of the comments others have made are just plain stupid best film ever my foot,0
manmohan desai made some entertaining though illogical films like aaa parvarish and naseeb but he made some craps like coolie and mard and then gjs br br this movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him the dial became famous mard ko dard nahin hota but the film is so bad you cringe br br the british are made carricatures and the film looks so weird the scene in the british hotel is damn stupid br br the film has many stupidities like amrita assaulting amitabh and then the entire scene plus towards the climax the film becomes even worse there are more gems like the horse statue getting life the masks of amitabh haha and more br br direction by manmohan desai is bad music is okay br br amitabh does his part with style nothing different from coolie laawaris type roles amrita singh is okay satyen kapuu is okay prem chopra is as usual nirupa roy is again her usual self dara singh is also as usual,0
veteran sleazeball bruno mattei is at it again with this erotic thriller that clearly echoes joel schumacher's 8mm but as expected mattei does his movie on a minuscule budget so that it already looks obscure when it's newly released br br after her daughter gets abducted a mother enters the dark world of underground pornography because the kidnappers belong to an international organization that direct snuff films as long as the exclusive clients pay well the search for her daughter does not only lead the mother across europe but also into prostitution she goes to bed with some guys to get her clues when she finally reaches contact with the snuff organization lead by the mysterious doctor hades she's getting into great danger herself br br there is not much good to say about this one even though it starts promising problem is that the movie is by far not as sleazy or explicit as one might expect from the director who made films like blade violent snuff trap which was first released in russia is neither gory enough nor does it contain the amount of nudity and sex to really keep the viewer's attention the plot isn't that special either except maybe for the surprisingly many different locations throughout europe the ending is hugely disappointing the acting isn't really remarkable either except for anita auer who plays doctor hades she looks and acts extremely creepy you don't want to meet her like this in a dark alley or your bedroom for that matter br br all in all snuff trap only appeals to collectors of bruno mattei's films but it's good to see the man back on the helm again it was his first thriller since 1994's giallo gli occhi dentro,0
just saw ice age a very funny and especially nice looking film the story is simple but effective the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what really shines is the digital set design br br more inspired by traditional animated movies than reality the designs give you a really really nice looking world in a astounding use of colour sometimes the touches of reality shine through especially the water was impressive but nonetheless it's a fantasy world based on reality including loads of vast landscapes especially helps to minimise the costs of rendering br br pixar films shine with technical brilliance this one shines with effective uses of technical know how br br enough technical babble the film's entertaining family friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny,1
while this was a better movie than 101 dalmations live action not animated version i think it still fell a little short of what disney could do it was well filmed the music was more suited to the action and the effects were better done compared to 101 the acting was perhaps better but then the human characters were given far more appropriate roles in this sequel and glenn close is really not to be missed as in the first movie she makes it shine her poor lackey and the overzealous furrier sidekicks are wonderful characters to play off of and they add to the spectacle disney has given us this is a great family film with little or no objectionable material and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike it's bound to be a classic as so many disney films are here's to hoping the third will be even better still because you know they probably want to make one,1

mulholland drive made me the definitive fan of david lynch he's a modern genius because he's not only a film maker his stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen so the straight story was quite a surprise to me with its easy to follow storyline and sunny sets still lynch is there and while this is far from his best it's a film not to be missed late richard farnsworth's performance is one of the reasons br br 8 10,1
don't get the impression from other reviewers that this film stinks cos it's ambivalent about the japanese whaling industry which morally is no worse than the us meat trade or the scottish haggis cull it stinks cos it's pretentious tosh the sort of up its own behind guff that gets modern art a bad name that said there are some stunning images but there are stunning images in the average bus ride if you use your imagination so that's no reason to go and see this nonsense what happens in the film happens very slowly and often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a cat being gutted and then just when you thinks it's finished it starts again i saw it it in a porn cinema in rome which had been hired for the weekend to show barney's film works which is an admirable and clever way to reclaim what had once been a local fleapit from the dirty old men in macs brigade but if the trendy young things and the slightly older beard stroking bjork fans were to be honest everyone might have had a lot more fun if they'd just shown one of the pornoes,0
what a class bit of british cinema it's about time and a side splitting comedy to boot br br anyone searching to relive a bit of freedom from their misspent youth this road movie will prove the ticket br br it's a mix between withnail and i and easy rider the movie runs at a solid pace and doesn't let you drift off for too long at times there are reflective moments but i think they are well justified and add to the characters the actors are portraying i was a little concerned with phil daniels character at the start but thankfully was won over half way through in what was one of the funniest scenes of the entire movie generally i found myself belly laughing through the film most likely annoying some people around me oh well br br i would thoroughly recommend it this will become a cult british comedy well worth a visit,1
the endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me this truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard of population is compelling well documented and enraging as an american i am constantly humiliated by my country's behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement we suck this is probably the first john pilger documentary i've seen but it immediately made me want to see what else he's done my only complaint and the reason i gave this film only 8 out of 10 is that pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the us and uk governments demands that we viewers citizens are complicit in our own inaction but makes no suggestion of how to help i don't know about britain but america's made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their government's doings a gesture in the right direction might help these islanders' cause,1
this movie had a good story but was brought down because it didn't have enough horror film elements and violence it was like watching a live action cartoon it would of been better if this story is what they planned from the start of the first movie so they could of played seeds for where the series was going,0
though not a fan of sam rockwell i was surprised when i saw his name in the credits in the opening of 'joshua ' heck i wasn't even aware he was in 'joshua' until i started the movie so it goes without saying i was watching the movie on the basis of the movie not the leads a sort of 'rosemary's baby ' 'the omen' or any other demonic kid movie 'joshua' was billed unfortunately it fell flat slow incredibly slow and flat yet i continued on to see how this would all resolve hoping beyond belief the ending climax would shed some light on the subject okay i admit it did a wee bit but what a stale closing and what a low low budget movie or at least that's how they designed it a person falls  you don't see the drop you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood a person gets hit by a cab  you don't see it you see someone complaining holding a bike up i'm not sure if this is called style or laziness or simply lack of funds for special effects we have a rich family with a crazy mom a workaholic father attempting to balance everything a kid  joshua who may may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot she cries as much as we see how many days she's alive  and what was that about are there rats above or is it joshua is his mother nuts is joshua crazy is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family is he going to grow up to be michael myers or does he drive his family to the brink i don't think so they were nuts prior and no so called acting could make me believe otherwise unfortunately barely any questions were answered barely any open doors shut i'm sure that might have been the idea but for pete's sake give me something anything there are plenty better kid gone wild movies to explore joshua's more like the mini me of the antichrist,0
great movie when i saw it have to say one of my favorite movies of all time i saw it like 8 times in the theater and got the dvd as i got older and saw it again i realized that the movie is average compared to movies that are known ad good comedys this is nothing i mean rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching with the racial stuff breaks a little barriers which is great also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking it's like most thought of a movie but also a little twist which is a very nice touch i like the movie overall so i give it a br br still a good 7 10 for me,1
when i first saw this film on cable it instantly became one of my favorite movies i'm a big fan of james earl jones and robert duvall the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes most of the attitudes came from soll an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor soll is what makes the move his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way the south was back then i suppose that if soll lived today he would be diagnosed with alzheimer's disease none the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex while he has racist views he's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black the two convicts he trusts most are jackson mel winkler and ben james earl jones the conversations between ben and soll are the best in the movie they have real chemistry james earl jones and mel winkler both but in great performances as well as hass br br this movie should have gotten more notoriety however it's on dvd and worth the money br br rayvyn,1
while this outing certainly doesn't live up to its predecessor it does have more than its share of memorable moments my personal favorite just after laying waste to a city block with his videodisc cannon we see a close up of nimoy's face as a single tear sheds from his left eye we know at that point that nimoy is more than just a killing machine the viewer can't help but be pulled into his emotional turmoil and we understand that his previously flat affect was only a facade absolute brilliance the sex scenes display a nice balance carnal but not pornographic afterwards i felt i had a pretty good understanding of how to work the magnavision videodisc player too bad they haven't produced them in over 25 years,0
as with that film we follow the implausible if always engaging adventures of the 2 lead characters but whilst c j eschew sex for a girly trip back into childhood this pair revel in their carnality even to the point of exploring homoeroticism most of the sex they acquire from grudging or unwilling partners and yet despite their deeply un pc behaviour everyone emerges smiling like c g through it all they remain innocents at heart rebels against the quotidien the bourgeois the restrictive as someone else has commented i wouldn't want to know these 2 and it's a minor miracle that their trip brings scenes of mostly comedy and very little tragedy and what there is of that cannot be laid at their door and thus for that reason it left me beguiled but with a sweet taste in the mouth dare i say that only the french can get away with films like this and that is part of their genius,1
i just finished watching this film and wow was that bad actually the only thing that kept me watching was that it was so monumentally bad it was kind of entertaining the action of the characters is hilarious from the hyper dramatic way they fall to gunfire to their incredibly bad acting were the bad guys all just pulled off the street or were they actually actors to incredibly bad delivery of lines to their inexplicable actions if you are going to try and shoot someone through a doorway as they enter obviously the thing to do is shoot directly at the doorknob this film must break some record for worst written and delivered lines br br the camera work was also really bad you can hardly see what's going on in the fight scenes due to switching camera angles and shakiness br br i would have voted 1 except that i do like chiba and sidekick sue shihomi and i was entertained by a couple of scenes 1 breaking of a villain's arm so the bone pops out of the skin that's gotta hurt 2 a drug kingpin eating a brown furred animal a monkey by hacking away at the carcass with a meat cleaver 3 sonny chiba's performing some impromptu eye surgery on a guy with his fingers br br i am actually a big fan of sonny chiba but this one is really not worth anyone's time i've seen about 7 or 8 of his films and have come to the conclusion that the only ones worth watching and they are great are the street fighter series and the killing machine i've also heard the executioner and golgo 13 are good i recommend sticking to those ones,0
in my opinion this movie advances no new thought seems to me like taking a spear to a spear without looking to the side the director seems to have an agenda duh i find that his rational is lacking there does not seem to be room for the alternative view i for one am usually on the side of the naysayer but this movie lacks credibility as it relies on the fantastic observations of the man woman on the street really now if you wish to cr5eate a credible alternative to a creed held onto for 2000 years you have got to make more of an effort allowing the other side to voice their beliefs i'm not sure but at the beginning of the movie it felt like an attack on the cristian faith i for one am a non believer but allow for the beliefs of others and would not wish no ridicule them but try to understand and tolerate,0
the movie itself is so pathetic it portrayed deaf people as cynical toward hearing people true some deaf people are wary of dating hearing people but they are not necessarily angry like of marlee matlin's character was throughout the story deaf people do not go to the bar and dance the way matlin did all in all the movie itself is more boring than pathetic it is so boring that i'd like to believe that it is an insomnia cured movie if i have a problem sleeping i can simply pop in children of a lesser god and watch it will put me to sleep br br keep in mind this is a deaf guy talking,0
this movie had good intentions and a good story to work with the director and screenwriter of this movie failed miserably and created a dull boring filmstrip that made me feel like i was back in mr hartford's 8th grade social studies class way back in 67 br br what a waste will somebody please take this story and make a real movie out of it the story deserves it br br every time a scene had potential all we were left with were a few clichés combined with black and white footage that they probably got from the history channel to show the action shameful br br ossie davis was the only bright light in this dull fest the other acting was incredibly dull it fit in with the movie well and whomever played the captain set a new low standard for line delivery br br however if you are willing to accept all the numerous flaws in this movie and aren't concerned with being awed or entertained but want to learn about the uss mason it is worth a watch,0
it seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip basic instinct 2 to the point that a significant part of the audience including critics found it terrible even before it was released it seems even more fashionable to trash sharon stone wholike all of usis now fourteen years older andunlike most of usstill looks wonderful first comments on this movie were so vicious that i had to see for myself in my opinion this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film but is not as bad as most comments pretend michael caton jones is not paul verhoeven neither henry bean and leora barish are joe eszterhas basic instinct 2 is just an entertaining average thriller and besides the addition of jerry goldsmith original score keeps little resemblance to its predecessor even stone gives her character a different dimension creating a lustful devilish catherine trimell who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like hannibal lecter she is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure unfortunately she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick she became too successful too much of a main icon and like all those actors who have reached that level her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by hollywood audiences br br the rest of the cast is outstanding giving performances that are far better than the material deserves david morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than michael douglas his acting is flawless giving a dense complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie he can keep your attention from beginning to end br br i am not recommending basic instinct 2 as a great movie i am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are shaping the opinion of most spectators,1
i may be biased i am the author of the novel the hungry bachelors club self published in 1994 the screenplay was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor fred dresch who was the inspiration for the character marlon in the film i couldn't be more pleased with the trailer i hope to see the film in its entirety and i will further comment but jorja fox who plays delmar youngblood my character is stellar she carries the bulk of the emotional vehicles in fine form i couldn't have done better myself this looks like real people hardly formula driven and thankfully drives my statement against racial prejudice home gracefully and heartfelt,1
i thought i had seen this movie twice in fact then i read all the other reviews and they didn't quite match up a man and three young students two girls and a boy go to this town to study alleged bigfoot sightings i still feel pretty confident that this is the movie i saw despite the discrepancies in the reviews therefore i'm putting my review back if you like the occasional 'b' movie as i do then return to boggy creek is the movie for you whether it's setting the sleep timer and nodding off to your favorite movie bomb or just hanging out with friends boggy creek the mute button and you've got a fun night of improv look out is the legend true i think we just might find out along with a not so stellar cast will there be any equipment malfunctions at particularly key moments in the film does our blonde manly young hero have any chest hair will the exceptionally high tech technicolor last the entire film you'll have to watch to find out for yourself,0
marilyn miller made only three films before her untimely death the marvelous sally 1929 the comedy her majesty love 1931 and this trifle sunny 1930 it is quite poor both as an early talkie and as an attempt at a musical although she has four dance numbers she only sings two songs who and one man alone the rest of the score including the spritely title tune are jettisoned although we can hear the latter in the background scoring miller looks overweight and amateurish here no star quality at all even her dancing is cloutish the film is very badly written stock full of stale and unfunny jokes and stupid situations if you're interested in miller as a performer by all means check it out but for general entertainment stay away,0
i was so disappointed by this show after hearing and reading all the hoopla about it how it was a ground breaking show and all sorts of wild promises if quality i tried to watch it br br what a letdown the acting was way forced and exaggerated the story made very little sense as for any hint of the vaunted look into teenagers' lives i could only see a paltry attempt that had as much reality to it as a reality show br br some are wondering why there are so many negative comments about this show the reason is that it's really not all that good and beating the drums over quality on this show only serves to attract attention to how poorly made it is,0
playwright sidney bruhl a wonderfully over the top michael caine would kill for a hit play enter young wonder kid a solid reeve who's just written such a play weave into this bruhl's overly hysterical wife superbly played by cannon and a german psychic a very funny irene worth and you've got yourself a wonderfully funny suspense flick br br while not up to sleuth standards deathtrap is none the less a very capable twist filled comical suspense ride based on a terrific play by ira levin the performers are obviously having a field day with the material with caine in particular delivering top notch lines with gusto br br the film loses a bit of steam midway through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play but overall deathtrap is solid well acted and suspenseful fun,1
this is a classic example of an increasing problem with films why is the background noise and the soundtrack dramatically louder than the dialogue what sense does that make this film isn't alone most films seem to do this now for 2 years i wondered if it was just something wrong with my tv but then i got a new tv there it is again background noise that could be taking place a city block behind the actors drowns out the dialogue br br it was even more distracting in this film because in the english version anyway the woman mumbles constantly i kept hoping jean reno would say excuse me would you speak up or get the marbles out of your mouth if you watch it on dvd you have even high school french i recommend the french version with subtitles br br i give it 4 because reno was so good in leon people rave about the scenery but i saw it on a tv i lived in the rockies for a few years so enh,0
nice character development in a pretty cool milieu being a male i'm probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start it isn't as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters each has their own thing that they contend with once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion what i enjoyed about this movie is that it didn't go for cheap comedy when it could have it didn't try to pound a lesson into us the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people,1
camera work why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy this is annoying and distracting editing the flashes of the still pictures were way too short many of the other scenes were too short also just flashes sound the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices one should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said doesn't anybody check these things and make them do it over again please reduce the volume of the background music in future is adjustment of the relative sound levels the job of the editor julia wong the plot had way too many loose ends the basic story line had potential i think the film needed more work was it rushed perhaps they ran out of money like a lot of movies it started out great but just petered out toward the end i really don't understand this you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesn't all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboard br br sorry to be so critical,0
oscar caliber performance by peter falk in an oscar caliber written role i loved the nuanced balanced exploration of a long time marriage how often do we get that in films where usually the movie ends when boy girl get together this is a movie for adults a complex view through the eyes of all parties husband wife son how each have adapted to each other in the past and grow during the story on top of that it gave me about 10 major belly laughs and i'm one of those people who usually sits unamused when the rest of an audience is laughing this was one of the few truly funny movies i've seen great original jokes,1
my father grew grew up watching george reeves as superman and when i was a little kid he had episodes on vhs and let me view them including this movie passing them down in the family if you will and i loved it br br clark kent and lois lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men radioactive and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and it's up to superman to stop this mayhem br br it's just so wonderful and fun to view the old style special effects and sound the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology george reeves was my hero when i was a little kid and i'm 16 now it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are,1
i remember being forced yes literally forced to see this film by a southern baptist preacher when i was a kid and even then i loved its awfulness it's designed to scare poor suckers into being saved the only thing that saved me was the fact that it finally ended and i could go out and have a real life br br check out the chapter on this film in sarah diamond's book the politics of the christian right fascinating and certainly more interesting than the movie,0
this film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of sex in the city and four weddings and a funeral in fact if they'd called it sex at a funeral they might have done better at the box office br br but the film falls between two stools and can't get up the characters spout improbably bright dialog but never act in any way remotely recognizable as human one arbitrary senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot and one soon tires of the falsity of the whole enterprise br br andie macdowell gets points for acting her little heart out but the performing honors are stolen by imelda staunton as of all things a police detective don't they have a height requirement over there ms staunton seems unable to make a false move would that we could say the same about the writer director br br if notting hill annoyed you as being bogus stay away from this one phonus bolognus on the half shell,0
i don't know what it is with these brady kids first barry williams publicly brags about having sexy with his tv sister maureen mccormick then about dating his tv mom florence hederson then susan cindy olsen does music for a bunch of porno movies then mike bobby lookinland gets in trouble for drunk driving finally maureen marcia mccormick and eve jan plum might have had a little same sex fling on the side now christopher peter knight is pursued by a beautiful young model in her early 20s during his stint on the surreal life which at first was fun to watch and now they are married and in a very volatile and hostile relationship the last episode where she posed for a bunch of nude photographs with another naked girl for a scrapbook to give to christopher for his birthday was not a good move on her part and he dealt with it in a very mature fashion just picking up and leaving to clear his head i think he was always bowing to her every need and now he's finally taking a stand and i hate to say it but i think she abuses him verbally the way she was torturing him for an engagement ring and the way she reams him for every little thing also she talks openly about having flings with other women and it is obvious she still sleeps around on him with women and men which is not something any self respecting human being should do when already married to someone if this were a man talking down to his wife like that and going out every night partying and having sex with other people everyone would be rallying behind the wife to leave him why should this be any different what started out as a cute little crush on another reality show blossomed into a huge disaster adrianne as beautiful as she is is like another britney spears and lindsay lohan clearly in need of some therapy because she cries like a baby over so many silly things i feel sorry for her but chris needs to rid himself of her because he is a good man who cannot afford to be humiliated like this,0
this movie is one exception of the rule that a sequel is worser than the original its comedy at its best this movie is a fast action slapstick comedy where something seems to happened every second at more than one occasion the entire audience laughed loudly at a joke br br its a big advantage to have seen the first movie but its not a requirement br br göta kanal 2 also have the advantage of being a parody on the latest decades reality production tv series such as survivor expediton robinson in swedish this is a swedish movie for the swedish audience thus don't see it if you aren't familiar with sweden and its language otherwise have fun johan,1
as some other comments show this movie might scare you when you're a little child and that is probably all that it is good for br br however if you're older this movie only does one thing suck majorly and thereby i don't mean the acting its soundtrack cutting or s th like that i'm simply talking about the plot if you can call it that br br spoilers ahead br br i don't want to give any more spoilers than necessary if after reading this you really still want to watch this movie but if you graduated from any school this is just a big insult of your intelligence when watching this i was stunned most of the time because what was happening was just that stupid br br this includes br br the forming of unite an evil un association br br we are just supposed to believe it's evil is it even evil at all if so why is it evil br br the mark of evil in the form of a tattoo br br there is no necessity to impose this on the people so why the hell no pun intended are they doing it br br inviting christ to your heart merely as lip service br br because there's nothing anybody who in this movie is considered a real christian ever does besides saying that stupid prayer so just say that prayer before the rapture and you're saved no matter what br br thus rating 1 10,0
tarzan and jane are living happily in the jungle some men come looking for ivory and to take jane back to civilization but jane loves tarzan and refuses to leave one of the men falls in love with jane and is determined to take her back even if that means killing tarzan br br this is a rarity a sequel that's better than the original tarzan the ape man of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged this one has much better effects and is a lot more adult there is tons of blatant racism a black man is shot to death point blank and no one really cares but this was 1934 there's also plenty of blood gore and violence for a 1934 movie and uncut prints have jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude there's also obvious sexual content and tarzan and jane are wearing next to nothing and it's implied they sleep together and have sex without being married this wouldn't bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme br br that aside the movie is well directed very fast moving and full of adventure and excitement seeing weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and jane's outfit is pretty revealing too i still think maureen o'sullivan is bad as jane but weismuller is perfect as tarzan everybody else is ok br br this is easily the best weismuller o'hara tarzan out there well worth seeing but not for kids,1
bob clampett's 'an itch in time' milks seven minutes of crazy action out of a very small premise elmer fudd tells his dog that if he scratches himself just once more that he will be given a dreaded bath unfortunately for the dog a relentless flea makes it all but impossible to stop from scratching the cartoon switches between the flea's progress inside the dog's fur and the dog's desperate attempts to cope with it in a great sequence that really captures the frustration of an itch that can't be scratched the dog changes colour from brown to blue to red to polka dotted to plaid it sounds ludicrously surreal but it perfectly evokes the indescribable feeling of an itch in a way only clampett could there are several other elements which make 'an itch in time' pure clampett there's the grotesque concept itself which leads to some graphic scenes of the flea munching on the dog's flesh there's the unrestrained violence that rears its head in any scene featuring the cat most notably there's the dirty jokes including a huge shot of the dog's behind which causes the flea to wolf whistle and a hysterical sequence in which the dog attempts to scratch himself by dragging his backside along the floor he momentarily breaks off to address the audience hey i better cut this out i may get to like it with a very limited concept clampett manages to make 'an itch in time' a unique minutiae based cartoon like an early episode of 'seinfeld' 'an itch in time' is practically about nothing but very funny with it,1
in the colonies we're not all that familiar with arthur askey so i nearly skipped this film which had its tcm preview recently on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in ghost train which i expected to be thoroughly annoying instead i was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly the physical aspects of askey's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you'd get if charlie chaplin and woody allen had a baby there is no comparing him to bud abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre one can feel moreover the thread connecting askey to british comedy 30 years later at least it is clear from an american point of view that he has more in common with the monty python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here as for the rest of the film the more movies you've seen the more likely you'll guess at the ending but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance,1
it's not very often a movie can literally make the entire audience laugh and five minutes later fill their eyes with tears many movies try to do this but few can deliver the emotional impact that this film did adam sandler practically drags you in with his heated and often violent outbursts but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past isn't pulling him down i'm not going to ruin anything but there is one scene in particular that should have your eyes watering and lip quivering even the most macho of men would have to be heartless bastards to not feel something while watching this movie don cheadle gives another great performance but is out shined by sandler liv tyler and jada pinkett smith give solid performances but nothing in the line of the two leading roles sandler's humor is still present which actually saved this film from being border line depressing there are several laughs to be had but don't think you will stay there long because it gets serious again without much warning br br i could go on and on about how well this movie hit on just about every emotion the human body contains but i will cut this one short i feel there is no need to tell you anything more do yourself a favor and take the time to see this movie even if you have to wait until it comes out on dvd it's 100 worth the time a deeply moving film sure to put tears in your eyes and a smile on your face unless of course you are a heartless soul,1
tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid i used to borrow the books from the school library every chance i got my favorite one was the red sea sharks so much action and humor br br this documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of herge and his development of tintin the film maker's personal experience in interviewing herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the chan character was very moving br br a great documentary of a very talented and well loved artist a great example of someone who has become internationally renown and has brought joy of millions of children and the young at heart all over the world,1
this is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless because stupid producers pay their money to make awful films like this instead of donating if they can bother br br this film is even worse than white chicks little man has a lame excuse for posing a character midget as a baby story is awful considering it was written by six people the idea still wouldn't be too bad though if it was original and not a rip off of a cartoon episode it has funny moments but some of them are way over done and some are just stupid the acting was very very bad so was the directing anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves it is racist and very offensive to midgets i mean instead of showing sympathy to them the film makers make fun of them it really disgusts me how they do it they see midgets being just like babies and for a character who is a midget pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family that is its lame excuse for showing something like that it just was not worth it don't watch this film it is a huge waste of time and money,0
this movie makes a promising start and then gets very confused and muddled kamal hasan has made a lot of effort in getting the period look right pity he did not spend more time on the plot most of the small characters in the movie show up for no particular reason br br overall very disappointing i would recommend avoiding this movie,0
well i'd be lying if i said that this could easily rival spiderman or the batman movies still it was more appealing to me for it's moral value i first bought the vhs when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite my wife and i are avid supporters of robert townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie hollywood shuffle true he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable but his movies are still fun br br meteor man provides a hero with an urban contemporary feel i always felt that if there were superheroes they wouldn't provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics meteor man is realistic hero with real problems car broken into bad neighborhood local drug dealing gangs using children for distribution etc the scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community br br what i found to be truly entertaining outside of james earl jones' young forever performance was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers it wasn't long before they had a full agenda lined up for him without his input of course it was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families lived br br yes the plot was weak the movie was predictable there was bad acting and continuity was rotten but it ranks 1 with my kids robert townsend works to bring movies home so to speak i doubt he'll ever truly be recognized as the talented actor producer director he truly is but there are and will always be those that love him for his efforts br br one point to ponder about the film which i find amusing throughout the entire battle with simon no one bothered to call the police also what mother and father do you know that will watch their son fight from a window my mother would have been right there scrapping by my side toe to toe dad would be loading his pistol lol br br rent it and check it out it's worth seeing at least once and good for those of you that are fans of sinbad luther vandross bill cosby big daddy kane etc great job with the cameos robert,0
everybody just seems to be raving about the subject and not really noticing how the movie was made the deaf mute guy is fine the underdog wins that's good the cricket aspect is great but the movie is average overall i think it could be made much much better than it is br br the plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a real life event i'm sure the movie could have been made more interesting the songs are just stuffed in there and i had to literally forward the scenes where the same thing would be shown from different angles br br good acting though watchable,0
yes its an art to successfully make a slow paced thriller br br the story unfolds in nice volumes while you don't even notice it happening br br fine performance by robin williams the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film however the core plot is very engaging the movie doesn't rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering the direction is good use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good br br very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story,1
this show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel it is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera it's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style br br it also borrows from an early cbs game show pioneer beat the clock by inventing situations for its contestants to try overcome then it rewards the winner money if they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters even better while the game format is in slow motion versus beat the clock the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality br br this show has elements of several types of successful past programs reality television hardly but if your hooked on the contestants locale or contest this is your cup of tea if your not this entire series is as i say drivel dripping with gravy it is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000 br br it is slick well produced so it might last a while yet after all so do re runs of gilligan's island green acres the beverly hillbillies the brady bunch this just doesn't employ professional actors the intelligence level is about the same,0
being a person who does not usually enjoy boxing movies feeling they only focus on the boxing and not the characters themselves this movie truly moved me i loved being able to see the main character diana michelle rodriguez go through so many things in such a short while it was amazing to me michelle rodriguez did such a wonderful job playing diana especially since this was her first acting experience she showed true emotion and portrayed diana wonderfully all actors had chemistry on screen and made this movie even more amazing i highly recommend this movie even to those who do not usually watch boxing movies 10 10,1
far richer in texture and character than even the classics from the 30's and 50's george c scott was born to be scrooge just as he was born to be patton mr scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century the character of scrooge as played by mr scott seemed to jump off the screen scott as scrooge brought an richer more robust yet a more deeply moving scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century london mr scott seemed to bring scrooge to a more personal understandable yet highly conflicted level his role was acted with the great authority scott always bring to the screen yet his usual bellicose voice would sometimes be brought to a whisper almost as a soliloquy as he would berate the christmas holiday in one breath yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line he could portray the sour and crusty scrooge and a misunderstood sympathetic scrooge all in the same scene br br truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation,1
jean claude van damme tries to rescue his career by making the sequel of universal soldier but did that movie saved him i think he goes to hell after he dies br br in the first minute we see the inside of a facility where you can see the bad guy of the film scary huh but not as scary as the acting details are following br br then we see van damme with a black girl do not remember the name well it doesn't matter anyway trying to escape from some muscle men of course they are the new universal soldiers more muscels less brain just like the movie after a while van damme fights goldberg but then the mission gets aborted it was just a test is this movie a test for our nerves it turns out that van damme works for the government on the new universal soldier project who has seen the first movie may think that this is the most unlogical thing that yould van dammes character could do but it is a sequel and a story has to come up ah i forgot he has a daughter very important for the story br br well after about 20 minutes a super computer hears a conversation about shutting it down and quitting he project of course the cube gets angry and activates all soldiers to kill everyone van damme escapes from the facility but the computer sends some soldiers hunting him it wants van damme as a soldier because he is the best really and guess what goldberg is one of the hunters who was always a silly sentence for the audience before he gets asskicked funny yes just like the rest of the film br br after some story van damme tries to rescue his daughter of his wife the reporter in the first movie it comes to a final show down where van damme fights the bad guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie please see for yourself it is just too funny to tell br br you'll see that this movie is a waste of time br br so do not watch it but if you do keep a sixpack with you,0
this movie was by far the worst movie that i have ever seen in my entire life i'm not even kidding it was poorly made and the actors couldn't act it was a waste of my time and money it looked like a movie that my friends and i could have put together on our own the case the movie came in is definitely a disguise nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case it appears that the director or make up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie the credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie which watching the credits was the best part of the movie this was honestly an awful movie and i couldn't believe how badly it was put together scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like whats going on the audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen's joking around making a fake fight scene br br if you are considering renting or buying this movie i would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show's how awful it truly is i wish i would have watched it before i rented it,0
revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films since in fact most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events unfortunately what this film lacks in drama is compensated for by an overabundance of boredom one cares not who wins loses dies or lives just end it as soon as possible this is due in large measure to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology scenes of paris and the french countryside have a cardboard quality about them they might better be done on a bare stage and left that way one cannot expect the amazing effects of the house of the flying daggers or the golden compass but after all this is a 2002 digitally mastered production characters seem to enter a scene for the sake of entering a scene so much so that one loses count of the number of times character enter and leave rooms in my view this film turns the french revolution of the 1790s into the papier mache revolution of a papier colle world,0
this is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists all over the world the documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts the only thing being shared is 9 11 as a theme very minor in some cases some of the segements are weak while others are very strong some are political some are not some are solely about 9 11 some simply use 9 11 as a theme to touch on human feelings emotions and tragedies that are universal some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic this film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerful br br this is a very controversial film especially for conservative americans i think two segments might really tick off the right wingers one from egypt where a dead american soldier and a dead palestinian bomber come back as spirits another from uk which recounts the us backed overthrow of chile on sept 11 1973 which resulted in 50 000 deaths and horrible atrocities the segment from mexico was the most powerful recounting the fall of the towers and the resulting death in vivid fashion you have to see it to believe it br br even though the final product is uneven with some segments being almost pointless i still recommend this it's very difficult to rank this film because the segments vary all over the place some weak some very powerful i'm giving this a rating of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that usually get censored mexico segment uk segment japan segment egypt segment,1
if only all animation was this great this film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects story and character the characters in this film are beautifully personified i felt for all of the characters and human animal relationship in the movie works perfectly the beautiful animation and 3 d computer animation hasn't worked better in any other film this is a great movie for kids and for adults who want a classic hero's journey 8 of 10,1
in the spirit of the classic the sting this movie hits where it truly hurts in the heart a prim proper female psychiatrist hungry for adventure meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals the vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman and begs to be involved in his operation while the movie moves kind of slow it's climax and ending are stunning you'll especially enjoy how the doctor forgives herself,1
60 minutes in the beautiful christina galbo tries to escape the isolated boarding school she's brought to at the beginning of the movie is she running from some kind of fate too horrible to contemplate a monster black gloved killer or supernatural evil no she's running from a bunch of bullies for the other 40 minutes that follow various figures walk around the school in the dark holding candelabras and looking alarmed or distraught which doesn't say much in itself perhaps because great movies have been made about just that but if you're going to have characters walking around corridors and staircases you better be alain resnais or you better know how to light that staircase in bright apple reds and purples like mario bava we know a killer stalks the perimeters of the school but his body count is pitiful and sparse and in the absence of the visceral horrors one expects to find in the giallo we get no sense of sinister mysteries unspeakable secrets festering behind a facade of order and piety and rightness which is the kind of movie la residencia wants to be but doesn't quite know how to do it we know something is off because girls are reported missing but we never get the foreboding mysterious atmosphere that says something is seriously f cking wrong here man when serrador tries to comment on the sexual repression of the female students he does so with quick cutting hysterics and detail closeups of eyes and parted lips while high pitched this is shocking music blares in the background none of the aetherial beauty and longing of picnic at hanging rock to be found here it's all a bit clumsy and aimless with no real sense of urgency or direction a number of people are presented as suspects but there's little reason to care for the identity of a killer that goes unnoticed by the characters inside the movie i like the first kill the image of a knife hitting target superimposed over the anguished face of the victim as a lullaby chimes in the background but the rest is too inconsequential for my taste i have to say serrador did much better with the killing children and paranoia du soleil of who can kill a child,0
this movie is a waste of film stock do you believe that the map of a plan of a military mission would be placed on an easel on a patio in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see it happened in this film do you believe that a deaf person would actually be enlisted in the active duty army in europe during wwii to serve in a negro unit cooking supply services burial detail etc it happened in this film do you believe that a black and supposedly intelligent officer would select this same deaf k p to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the germans before the allies arrived it happened in this film would you be surprised that the deaf soldier didn't realize that a german plane was approaching from behind and would strafe and kill him it happened in this film would you be surprised that a group of american soldiers hold up in a barn at a farmhouse that the germans happened upon would shout out their emotions at the sight of the german soldiers who were just 50' away they did it in this film and left any possible entrances to the barn the germans might check totally unprotected would you believe that over the airwaves and in clear english the captain mentioned the general's rank if not his name as the person he was speaking with and that the general in plain english over open airwaves said that the dam had to be protected the next day maybe they should have just sent in an emissary to tell which direction the american attack would be coming from just to make it a little easier on the germans this so called movie should be placed on a list of the top 50 worst films if it were i'm sure it would do well watch it at your own risk,0
saw this film on dvd yesterday and was gob smacked and flabbergasted the unaffected acting of ddl just blew my mind and i was surprised by the whole cast and its superb acting all of the character were so authentic to me i really took ddl for christy burns and brenda fricker for his mom go and see it you'll cry your heart out but you'll experience a wonderful catharsis besides it teaches you one important lesson determination is everything you may be a cripple in the poor suburbs of dublin but when you are headstrong enough you will have no problems at all if you can only operate your left foot you are still good enough to be a painter or a writer the worst thing you can do when you are mentally challenged is to indulge in self pity it won't get you anywhere and the only person who'll pity you will be yourself,1
though structured totally different from the book by tim krabbé who wrote the original 'the vanishing' spoorloos it does have the same overall feel except for that koolhoven's style is less business like and more lyric the beginning is great the middle is fine but the sting is in the end a surprise emotional ending as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very beautifully never explicit but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour it is a shame american films can't be as open an honoust as this one where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject 'de grot' stays always within the boundaries of good taste 'de grot' tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years when you'll leave the cinema you'll be moved what can we ask more of a film anyway this film even gives more,1
this is the first of these 8 films to die for collection that i've seen and it's certainly not made me want to see any of the rest although i've heard at least a couple of them are decent i don't know this wasn't terrible but it didn't really do much for me your basic dysfunctional cannibal family in suburbia kind of thing mom dad died the family sold the farm moved to san francisco where they continued to bring home stray food sources whenever possible the best part of this was the creepy goth sister who of course invites a friend over from school that never leaves anyway of course we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on and so on this family is sort of like the white bread version of the sawyer clan they're nasty they do bad things but they ain't go no soul i see a lot of reviews from people that liked this and i guess i don't know what i missed but i found it to be very mediocre i wouldn't recommend it to anyone really 4 out of 10,0
delightful disney film with angela lansbury in fine form as a middle age spinster whose interest turns to witchcraft in world war 11 england br br lansbury was about age 51 at the time of the film and she is just ideal for the part she is jessica fletcher again but this time it's for the benefit or children and for mother england during a time of great peril br br the film follows the adventures of miss price lansbury and david tomlinson as the professor of witchcraft in trying to obtain certain information on sorcery those 3 little darlings sent to live with price to escape the london bombings are just wonderful in this enchanting film for all of us regardless of age br br too bad that tessie o'shea roddy mcdowall and sam jaffe are given so little to do in this endearing film br br i really thought of the ben stiller film night at the museum at the end of the film when the relics come to life to do battle with the nazi invasion in the small british coastal town,1
i first saw this movie back in the 1980's and now in 2006 this movie still is one of the best movies i have ever seen i would recommend anyone to look at this movie you will not be sorry it is well acted out so real and never a dull moment the acting is superb and the location makes the movie seem like you are there from the beginning right up to the end this movie is the type that makes you lose your attention the actress does an excellent job of portraying the girl who survived this horrific plane crash in the amazon and it shows how she managed to survive in the amazon all alone it is unbelievable that anyone could survive under such conditions this is why this movie is so appealing the fact that this is a true story makes the movie even more interesting and to think that a young girl could survive from this ordeal is overwhelming i find this movie one that i can watch over and over again and one that i never get tired of this is indeed quite a compliment as i have hundreds of movies i would say this is probably my favorite movie and the best i have ever seen,1
people claim its edited funny but they had to cut it down substantially in post production i have harry as a professor right now at ucsd and honestly its one of the best classes i've had its rather funny to here about what happened in making the film cause harry is so animated i originally watched joy of life for another class where harry did a voice over in the film and started watching this film after i started the class harry originally did some performance work and is really genuine about creating moments that move you especially when you have to re edit things until you hit on that moment but its something you see in this film,1
i have no idea why they made this version of persuasion when they already had that fine mini series with amanda root and ciaran hinds i suppose that they wanted to make a feature length version but of course a lot had to be deleted alas what ended up on the cutting room floor was all the lovely wit and humour leaving a film that was mere melodrama rather than an amusing exposition of english country manners and mores br br also the characters were shallow and uninteresting they had poor anne chasing up and down the streets after captain wentworth like a silly modern adolescent and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this let me tell you running after a male like a female in heat is not cool that is something a well bred woman of the napoleonic era would never have done and certainly not this level headed heroine br br some have said they found this antic laughable my reaction was not laughter but outrage the very idea of such a corruption of an austen work is beneath contempt br br it was ghastly,0
very businesslike authority with little responsibility and only a desire to keep his her name clean check a veteran cop that has bad relationship with his family check mafia guys that while criminals want to do something good vigilante style check a sociopath and loyal mafia guy not hesitant to kill people to make an example check cops' methods being less effective than the mafia guy's brutal yet very effective methods check a corrupt cop tying the authority the criminals and the police together check br br slow motion and or jerky frame rates for showing what the actor's reaction can't check a serial killer whose background is explained in far too much detail esp using childhood abuse as the reason for everything check a child spree killer that is very very non menacing check foreshadowing of the veteran cop's moral values not being what the killer deserves in the movie's and the majority of characters' opinion check morally ambiguous and predictable ending thanks to the foreshadowing and the good veteran cop's coming to terms he should submit to the vigilante attitude of the majority of the characters check br br recently saw this on tv and decided to endure it because it had dennis hopper in it and i could not sleep check realized that was a mistake and should just have stared at the ceiling check,0
painful painful is the only word to describe this awful rendition of such a fun and interesting shakespearean play i gave it a shot but was terribly disappointed and couldn't bare to even finish viewing it to the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this twist of much ado was i pity you and your bored brain may your pretenses about young viewers be lifted without retribution please do not even bother with this gut wrenching disgusting excuse for a performance of an acclaimed shakespeare drama you will be forced to induce vomiting and will require a commode close to the television with which you choose to watch this crap because involuntary defecation will take place,0
this film just goes around in circles and the viewer does not know where they are at first i thought mmmmm could be kinda cool movie this but it just drags on and on and eventually you don't know what's going on the lead female is a good actress and played her role well and the psycho fella is creepy but after a bit you don't really care what happens because this film just drags on shame really this could have turned out a lot better br br would say though that the lead female and psycho fella will have a good career ahead of them but will they remember this film for making them known or for being the film they regret they ever made,0
i rented this movie thinking it looked like a wonderfully delightful historical piece what i got was a piece of pure garbage this movie was confusing in most spots choppy in almost every spot and dreadful in all spots mira sorvino's portrayal of a queen playing a young male scholar was depressing at best ben kingsley should have been stripped of his knighthood for even considering this film as one of his projects fiona shaw should definitely stick to playing petunia dursley at least the harry potter movies are more entertaining than this thing they call a play within a movie br br the cinematography looks like some college kid took a class in cinematography 101 and failed miserably almost every scene in the movie is chopped up for some sort of effect the end result of course being the cheesiest bit of editing i've ever seen jay rodan was almost good as agis too bad he had such a bad script to work with rachael stirling gives her best effort as the almost gullible lady in waiting in the end i really wish blockbuster video gave refunds i'm so glad i didn't spend 10 bucks watching this fiasco in the theater if they've been performing this marivaux play since the 18th century it makes me wonder how many people over the ages have had their best naps during this work if i had been there they wouldn't have hear the play over the snoring thank goodness for the modern convenience of dvd players you can skip past the boring or awful scenes guess that means i only watched the beginning and the end,0
i think charlotte gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world i can't understand why some people say she's not boring maybe the one who said she's boring is because he she is boring she's a great actress and the movie was excellent it has lots of wonderful ideas and very good performers the direction was great i imaging myself in the french environment with all the sophistication and perfume flowers churches problems etc when she goes to the sister's shop is simply amazing everything's great we have a very good actress wonderful for long time alain chabat and bernadette lafont are perfect i like him more than in his next movie la science des rÊves and eric lartigau did a very good work br br ana,1
hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straight forward drama without much to recommend it hitchcock's talent though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point of view shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women the object of the boxers' desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships all in all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcock's early work and his development as a visual storyteller,1
the worst movie in the history of cinema i don't know if it was trying to be funny or sad poignant or droll but the end result was unwatchable everyone from key grip to robin williams and back down to best boy should be ashamed to be a part of this film,0
please future writers producers directors learn from this movie br br never before have i seen such a bold and original tale created for the big movie screen bold because the script constantly made a step so many fantasy movies safely avoided a step to something new creative and daring just when you think 'oh i've seen this before' or 'i am sure this is what will happen now' stardust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more into the story br br the actors are great even the smallest part is performed with such talent it fills me with awe for the creators of this movie robert de niro is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene he's in michelle pfeiffer is the perfect witch and claire danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star' yvaine other big names make outstanding roles i had the filling everyone is trying to give his best for this movie but once again the story by neil gaiman all the little things he 'invented' for this universe simply outstanding br br i watched this movie at a pre screening today a day before the official release and do hope it will have huge success there is so much humor but also tense moments as well as lovely tender scenes the look in the eyes of yvaine the 'frivolities' of captain shakespeare the passion of lamia the witch impressive unforgettable br br for me this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007 watch it and enjoy it br br 11 10 outstanding br br peace and love,1
oh come on people give this film a break the one thing i liked about it was sorry still thinking oh yeah when john wayne came and shot up the the bad guys oh sorry wrong movie i was thinking of a better quality film let me see now i'm still trying to defend it oh yeah the chick that was from clueless was in it don't put down stacy dash i mean we all make mistakes but boy stacy you made a dooooosie br br hey one thing that has never been done in a western even an all female cast they actually hung a woman from the gallows that might be a western first even though her neck should have been broken and she survived the ordeal still you've got to give the director some effort for trying a western first also i've never seen a woman lynched from a horse in any western although that didn't happen in this movie i just thought i would give the director another idea for gang of roses 2 which should be made right after ed wood's bride of the monster 2 maybe that was what the makers of this film were going for orginality especially with an all african woman cast and an oriental cowgirl br br heeey if the makers of gang of roses want to make a sequel to this mess you could have such slang like hey don't you be takin about my homegirls and talk to the hand baby talk to the hand you could also have a surfer dude type deputy marshal that says things like that gunfight was totally rad man totally you know things like that,0
i am a huge fan of david lynch this film however was a quite disappointing experience apart from the ambient background music  which really sets the mood of the film  it lacks almost all the qualities that i've come to associate with lynch's work the visuals are dull to say the least and the dialog is to vague and monotone to be of any interest br br this feels more like a film students awkward try to do an arty dogma movie than the work of an experienced director i've seen a lot of amateur movies with far superior camera work scenery sound and script this film lacks almost all artistic qualities i feel as though i'm watching one of davids home videos produced during a weekend trip with some friends,0
that's right the movie is better than the book don't get me wrong i love the book but the movie is just so much better this film has jack nicholson and shelly duvall at their best i haven't seen scatman crothers and obviously danny lloyd in anything else some of the ideas used in this movie are better than the ones used in the book but i already talked about those in my comment on the mini series but i missed a few the film is shot at a better location than where the mini series was shot and the redrum scenes are creepier than those in the book so if you're looking for a great movie get stanley kubrick's the shining but count on having nightmares every night for 3 weeks,1
eddie murphy plays chandler jarrell a man who devotes his time to finding lost children when the beautiful kee nang charlotte lewis enters his life she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the golden child sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue jarrell gets involved without realising he's about to embark on a fantastical journey one that involves peril and worst of all the demon sardo numspa br br is the golden child a product of its time by that i mean was eddie murphy and the golden child's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences for i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade it's box office was 79 817 937 making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986 but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny eddie murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had the golden child is not up with the more accepted 80s murphy pictures like trading places and beverly hills cop but upon revisiting the film recently i personally find that it contains murphy at his wisecracking quipping and charming best seriously br br cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and temp lated by raiders of the lost ark in 1981 the golden child hits all the required genre buttons pretty girl daring reluctant hero with a quip in his armoury dashing villain charles dance so english i could kiss him myself wonderful colour and a cute kid with mystical powers the film only asks you to get involved in the fun not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture yes the cgi demon looks creaky now and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s 90s and beyond but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious seriously 7 10,1
this is an excellent show i had a us history teacher in high school that was much like this there are many facts in history that are not quite true and mr wuhl points them out very well in a way that is unforgettable br br mr wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students use of live actors performing skits is also very entertaining br br i highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down,1
the bank 1915 chaplin the bank was one of charlie's 1915 essanay films while these group of films are more watchable than their 1914 counterparts this one seems a bit below average the gag with the janitorial double combo locked vault and the tough luck ending that has charlie waking up from a dream in which he is stroking the lead lady's hair only to be stroking the head of a mop he had used as a quasi pillow are both classic chaplin moments they are both ironically the beginning and the end the middle is filled in with fighting with the rival co worker janitor and busting up a bank robbery to win the girl the mop is probably the greatest physical prop of this movie and charlie uses it to expert comedic effect whether while it is the intention of his character or not the mop seems to be charlie's alter ego doing things he wishes he could do but wouldn't with his own two hands interesting stuff but there's better,0
how many fricken' times do we have to see a spook walking by in the background peaking through a mirror's reflection it's been done in two dozen movies in recent memory four dozen times in this choppy poorly done film there were only two freaky moments to appreciate when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters speaking of characters the acting was as flat as the diet coke in the 64 oz cup i was drawing it from the side characters could have been pulled from various scooby doo cartoons there was the friendly aged sheriff there was the kooky weirdo living in the backwoods with the alabama drawl lots'o'characters with no development the most disturbing image was that of a murdered child in the beginning but rather than explore the child's murder which would have been interesting they just let us know that she was dead her parents had a hard time reconciling her death with the community each other when they reach the cabin the scenes rarely flowed together with flashing images of the dead daughter interjected here there oh and the eerie sounds were also overdone you know what i mean creaking doors that open by themselves crickets in the forest yada yada yada ooooohhhh haven't seen that before again you'll see the amazing self opening door in the movie over and over an over again note to director a scary scene is only scary if it's not repeated every 5 minutes in the same film think these things out before calling out it's a wrap,0
i was lucky to see oliver in 1968 on a big cinema screen in boston when i was a young teenager later during the summer of 1969 i was pleased to see this film was still playing at a prominent cinema in leicester square london after it had won the academy award for best picture of the previous year br br th success of oliver on both the stage and screen reminded me that not all talent begins on broadway and ends in hollywood this legendary story by charles dickens which is part of the literary heritage of all english speaking people was admirably brought to the london stage by lionel bart of great britain his charming musical then became a hit in new york and throughout the world the film adaptation was made in england during the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968 the sets and musical numbers are mind boggling the song who will buy required hundreds of actors and the british film director truly deserved his oscar for putting it all together in a seamless manner some canadian and american talent is also part of this wonderful production but mostly it is a tribute to the fine craftsmanship of the british film studios such as shepperton good show other film studios at elstree boreham wood bray denham and ealing have also given the world many films to treasure over the years,1
i have to say that grand canyon is one of the most affecting films i've ever seen i've watched it several times now and i still feel as i did the first time that this film by itself could make up the entire curriculum of a post graduate course in film direction br br a long time ago film trailers used to promise it'll make you laugh it'll make you cry that's a very trite and shorthand method of describing what grand canyon does it takes you to the best places in human experience and the next moment takes you to the gates of hell br br much of the film is paced to cycle back and forth between people being close to happiness and the same people being close to horror it's always a short step too just to manage that swing with grace and without making it look false or exaggerated is directorial genius br br spoiler of sorts coming up after getting the audience used to rocking back and forth through the emotional spectrum the film throws a curve with a sequence that doesn't go from good to bad and back but instead escalates from an ordinary marital spat through an accidental self inflicted knife wound that may or may not require stitches to an earthquake that has the characters run from the house in the moment of their relief argument forgotten cut finger forgotten the earthquake survived a neighbor woman calls out that her elderly husband has collapsed the couple rushes to his aid i cried when i saw this sequence i cried every time i saw it i'm crying now it isn't sadness that does this to me it's not a particularly sad sequence what tears me up is that this few minutes of film was perfect that's perfect astounding end of spoiler br br there's so much to say about grand canyon it portrays relatively ordinary people experiencing epiphanies and it lets the viewer experience them vicariously they aren't showy or overblown and there's no long pause to examine the moment carefully the film moves on at the pace of life even when the characters do try to make sense of what has happened they are uncertain of what to derive from their experience br br grand canyon is a very human film,1
if you thought that the original from 83 was bad then try out this modern day masterpiece how could it be worse more you ask well at least in the first one you had ally sheedy jogging in a sports bra other than updated graphics modern day themes such as terrorists modern weapons and a sexy new voice for ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story anyone that saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene line in the story was going and for anyone that didn't see the first one well consider yourself lucky that you only watched it once maybe in another 23 years hollywood will try again,0
with title like this you know you get pretty much lot of junk acting bad script bad director bad grammar bad br br movie make lot of noise that really not music and lot of people yell movie make bad racial stereotype why come every movie with black hero have drug addict why come hero always have to dance to be success why come famous rapper always have to be in dance movie why come letter s can't be in title br br hollywood need to stop dumb down audience and make movie that have people with brain who know how speak proper english br br do self favor and not go see,0
having not seen this film in about 20 years i am still impressed with it 's hard hitting impact and stellar acting of course one mr mickey rooney is indeed incredible in his role as the ring leading killer in reference to another review here none other than orson welles evoked mickey rooney's name as the greatest movie actor also i also recall the jazzy brassy score and the bare black and white photography i love the mick's last line before he goes out for his dose of lead poisoning i think the stranglers lifted it for a line in one of their songs get a grip on yourself this is a great film and unjustly buried film let's get it out side note a recent film review magazine gave a big write up on don segal's babyface nelson made a couple years before last mile and also starring mickey rooney another rave of the mick's intense and sympathetic performance perhaps it's the start of a groundswell of a appreciation for some truly superior cinematic performances,1
the film is side spliting from the outset eddie just seems to bring that uniqueness to the stage and makes the most basic thing funny from having an ice cream as a child to the long old tradition of the family get together the film is very rare in this country but unsure of availability in other countries i have searched through a lot of web sites and still no luck phoned companies that search for rare videos and there are year waiting lists for it so hints are very welcome if any one likes eddie murphy as a comedian and see's the video get it it is worth the money and can't go far wrong,1
in the last 10 years i have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling organizations managed many pro wrestlers including 2 backyard wrestling stars worked on 2 different wrestling tv programs and did voice overs and commentary for many wrestling dvd's i have never witnessed the level of outright amateurish stupidity lack of talent and skill and shoddy production quality found in splatter rampage wrestling to even list this as a wrestling video of any kind is an outright misuse of the term shot with low dollar video cameras it's essentially home videos of kids play fighting in back yards the sound quality is bad the video quality is bad and the acting is horrendous the wrestlers wear makeshift costumes with hand drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hit each other with a variety of items and halfway imitate wrestling moves sometimes the matches are on the grass sometimes on a back yard trampoline all are poorly acted and executed with a shameless lack of any wrestling skill in short don't bother with this stinker whether your interest in this dvd is entertainment or academic both in my case you will be terribly disappointed,0
this movie is just plain dumb br br from the casting of ralph meeker as mike hammer to the fatuous climax the film is an exercise in wooden predictability br br mike hammer is one of detective fiction's true sociopaths unlike marlow and spade who put pieces together to solve the mystery hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth this film turns hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are well too dumb to get away with anything one is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack br br other parts of the movie are right out of the three stooges play book velda's dance at the barre for instance or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back and the continuity breaks are shameful frau blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot the worst break however precedes the popcorn attack the bad guy stalking hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy br br to be fair there were some interesting camera angles and lighting and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10,0
i really wanted to like the pillow book intriguing story interesting character outlines ewan macgregor in the utterly glorious altogether unfortunately i hated every minute of it greenaway got so enamoured with presenting the movie uniquely and not to the film's benefit i won't even get into vivian wu's abysmal acting br br you get distracted from the story with 4 billion teeny windows and calligraphy that rolls on the bottom of the screen displaying the lyrics of the music that's playing it seems he lost sight of presenting the actual story and developing the plot and got entangled with foo foo embellishments that have nothing to do with anything it's a bit like presenting a john singer sargeant portrait in a chintzy hallmark frame that says grandma loves me in big sparkly letters br br this movie seems to be a casualty of the director auteur's ego instead of what it could have been disturbingly and horrifyingly beautiful in another director's hands jeunet coppola it could have been a masterpiece in greenaway's hands it's best relegated to fine arts classes that also take themselves too seriously,0
i have always had the philosophy that every single human being has different tastes i found this movie to be awesome and i think every college student out there might agree with me notwithstanding this is not a movie with a plot its about real guys and some of the problems that they face i found the movie hilarious especially the parts that they played the practical jokes on each other simply put if you are in the same wave length as these people you will find this movie amazing i don't think that this is going win any golden globes or oscars or that the people in this movie will become future hollywood stars but its a kind of cult classic among young people who could relate to their experience for me the guy that stands out the most is hans the scandinavian guy who according to him isnt a looker but gets all or some of the chicks the little people also play a big part in the movie especially when they are drunk if i keep going i might provide a spoiler and i don't want to do that just go and get the movie and you will not regret i give it a 8 10,1
this has got to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen there were people leaving the theatre others were falling asleep ok it was a late night show this is a no sense movie one of those who can make you never want to see an out of mainstream picture again i would love to watch the making off of this movie as i am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such garbage do they laugh when they create all this ridiculous stuff or do they actually think they're doing something interesting i wonder the soundtrack is awful apart from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous bjork album even if you're a fan of bjork's music stay home it's the best thing to do the little tiny pieces of nice music are no reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this torture god,0
i have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say even though this movie did not get the best comments this movie made my day it got me thinking what a false world this is br br what do you do when your most loved ones deceive you it's said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance same way some people are such that they are never grateful this movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself br br a brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster the surviving brother decides to take revenge through this process we learn about the futility of this world nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone br br amitabh gave the performance of his life the new actor aryan gave a good performance the actress who played the wife of amitabh stole the show her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herself br br a great movie by raj kumar santoshi his movies always give some message to the audience his movies are like novels of nanak singh a punjabi novelist who's novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil because they have a real message for the audience they are entertaining as well as lesson giving,1
this movie was a major disappointment on direction intellectual niveau plot and in the way it dealt with its subject painting it is a slow moving film set like an episode of wonder years with appalling lack of depth though it also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner br br the approach to the subject of painting is very elite limited to vague and subjective terms as beauty according to the makers of this movie 'beauty' can be only experienced in bob ross style kitschy landscape paintings good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic like primary school level color theory and lots of sentiment in parts the movie is offending e g at a point it is stated rather celebrated by dancing on tables that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting their works by definition being worthless 'bullshit' quote br br i do not understand how the movie could get such high rating then again so far not many people rated it and they chose for only very high or very low grades,0
i look around in the video store still in shock how steven seagal with his track record of bad action movies can still have 3 movies hit the shelves in less than a year attack force being the 3rd no less promised the first time entrance into the sci fi genre for our ever widening seagal visions of bad movie entertainment flashed before my gullible eyes sadly this is not the case one bit with no entertainment and a movie as bad as they come br br seagal rebounded a tiny bit with the trashy but enjoyable shadow man last time we saw him however attack force has to be his absolute worst movie ever don't argue for out for a kill ticker or even black dawn folks this is the bottom of the septic tank here br br anyone who says this is steven seagal's return to form should be forced to write a 100 page essay on the word taste br br seagal is yet another agent i'm a supreme bad ass yet again named lawson wants revenge for the killing of his team that leads him to a nefarious plot to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public not to mention the dealers are not from around here br br the whole production from directing to the acting is poor was this movie shot in the dark its gotta be the most poorly lighted movie since howling 2 the action is terrible and very badly done br br the producers have also unwisely decided to do what the fans hate the most throw in stunt double after stunt double and horribly dubbed steven seagal who seems to show little enthusiasm here can ya blame him br br while it has been said that attack force was not the movie stevie signed on for originally harvester and surely has to be better than attack force the post production tampering has not made it more coherent and made seagal look worse i feel bad for directer michael keusch and writer joe halpin as they are gonna be judged forever for the ill advised production re shoots br br so now this leaves seagal in the impossible position to come up with something to atone for this mess but after seeing how bad attack force has turned out do we really want him to make another movie,0
american pie beta house is sort of in limbo between genres on the one hand it's a comedy with no plot and few genuinely clever jokes on the other hand it's porno that's a tad too soft core to actually turn on any viewers essentially beta house is a collage of sex scenes some humiliating others just lame attempts at humor with a couple thin plot points thrown in an effort at cohesiveness the characters are barely even two dimensional most development relies on knowledge of naked mile and the important plot scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the writers even felt the need for a story br br in all fairness i did not go into this movie without expectations i liked the original three american pie movies and thought band camp and naked mile were solid rentals i thought naked mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters and so when i saw that some of the same characters were returning for beta house i was excited to see this installment i was aware that there would be numerous scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple forms and i was fine with it because in the past these scenes were backed by the story and were well integrated into the plot in beta house however it's almost as if the writers forgot why the formula in the other ap movies worked they spent too much energy working in the nudity that they forgot to actually write a story br br this movie is a disappointment and not even worth a one dollar rental the jokes are lame the story is non existent and the porno aspect is too tame if that's all you really care about seeing,0
what was with all the turkish actors no offense but i thought it was all for nothing for all these actors the film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability it demanded next to nothing i bought this film to see michael madsen he is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him the script was so bad their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didn't even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3 dimensional br br even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish it was really weird and they didn't sound like real guns a video game had better sound effects than this film there was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang he had this american whining voice like a girl shouting lines like lets get the f k out of here and what are we going to do man he sounded like a girl as a positive it was funny to watch and it made me laugh too for a few seconds whoo hoo dumb film poor madsen he will bounce back,0
the first thing i thought when i saw this films was it is not really a film at least it is not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word film it is entirely symbolic everything in it has a figurative meaning so if you are not used to express thing in a symbolic way you will find it strange if you are not acquainted with philosophy religion spiritual life you will think it's just a fairy tale and even a weird one chaotic for me the legend of zu is perfectly transparent and i do like it it tells us in images the story about the fight between light and darkness the fight that is as old as humanity and every one who is in search of the sens in this life is confronted with it the film is obviously made by buddhists i am not a buddhist my religion and the vision of the world and human is different but as far as we are all humans and have the same human nature we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other it is a really beautiful film and i which we had more films like this films that have a meaning there are too many empty stories which are good only to make time pass more quickly,1
this is a really strange film and that is not a bad thing it is a combination of a neo realistic film about the homeless and a fairy tale i'm sure that some may find this movie a bit too strange but i loved it once again this director brings together a wonderful cast of everyday people not actors and gets a great ensemble type performance although not nearly as sad as umberto d both movies have a very similar point to make this one just does it in a very absurdist way ignore the cheesy special effects after all it was made in the early 1950s and special effects aren't terribly important anyway or at least they shouldn't be in films instead just sit back and enjoy the very strange and silly ride unless you are a total curmudgeon you'll have a ball br br by the way since i first reviewed this film i have seen another desica directed film that is an absolute must see and that is the children are watching us while not a fantasy or light in spirit like miracle in milan a great film nevertheless,1
my college professor says that othello may be shakespeare's finest drama i don't know if i agree with him yet i bought this video version of the film first i love kenneth branagh as iago he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation surprisingly he didn't direct it but played a role lawrence fishburne shows that american actors can play shakespeare just as well as british actors can do not that there was a british vs american issue about it in fact if we all work together then shakespeare can reach the masses which it richly deserves to do apart from other shakespeare tragedies this is dealt with the issue of race something that has existed since the beginning of time the relationship between iago and emilia could have been better and shown the complicatedness of their union together while othello loves desdemona with all his heart he is weak for jealousy and fears losing her to a non moorish man like cassio it's quite a great scene at the end of the film but i won't reveal the ending it's just worth watching i think they edited much of the lines to 2 hours but they always edit shakespeare,1
this is the story of two guys who found a copy of 'funky monkey ' finding this seemed odd at the time figuring that there are still posters for the movie at the local cineplex odeon after seeing such classics as 'every which way but loose' and 'project x ' these two guys figured movies with monkeys are awesome br br these guys were in for a long ride as they watched this movie there was some monkey that was replaced by a stunt man when action sequences were required it was apparent that the monkey wasn't trained in the school of shakespearean acting perhaps replacing the monkey with ben affleck might have helped the guys thought br br maybe a strong sidekick would help like a jackie chan or heck maybe even hulk hogan luckily this movie had amazing martial artist and jet li look a like matthew modine while some might argue that matthew modine doesn't come close to jet li camera tricks prove that he is every bit as good when it becomes obvious that an untrained chimp can't handle the movie the movie leans on matthew modine to be the real star br br did i mention that there is some dorky kid that develops a bond with modine and the monkey is there a possibility that the kid learns confidence and even picks up a girl in this movie even matthew modine should get jealous with this one because using the pick up line 'i'm second fiddle to a monkey' doesn't seem to work with the ladies br br shortly after watching this movie the two guys got a phone call from matthew modine telling them 'seven days ',0
if you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it then tigerland is the film for you i love this movie from top to bottom this movie's picture perfect scenes look so real it's almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama boy i tell you real drama they actually real fought in one of the scenes get the dvd listen to the commentary its not obvious i see this film as a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape an ill fated destiny after watching saving private ryan i have an a appreciation of what an ill fated destiny is and know exactly how the men in the film feel i see this movie as a crossbreed between stand by me and saving private ryan what do men do when they are with a situation that's hard pressed in real life some men go crazy some men cry some men through fists others do drugs some randomly sleep with hookers ruthlessly trying to eradicate the meaning of love from their life some try drink the pain away some jump off buildings or bridges some feel guilty and others feel so much agony it makes them so sick they collapse physically this movie has all those desperate emotions rolled into one ball but don't get me wrong its not depressing movie its realistic its a very very humorous movie the cocky and funny bozz collin's character lights it all up and on top of that there are about 5 female actresses in the movie i'll let you figure out what their in there for with dialogue war action sequences picture perfect scenes along with appropriate music this movie has it all like i said from top to bottom i don't why tigerland is heavily under credited the best thing about owning the movie is that on the cover it says in big bold writing the best film of the year and it absolutely falls nothing short of that keep the rare gems coming hollywood 10 10,1
perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is otto preminger's 'where the sidewalks ends ' from a really excellent script by ben hecht based on the novel 'night cry' by frank rosenberg br br dana andrews is the honest tough new york policeman always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong arm methods as much as he detests crooks when he hit someone his knuckles hurt and the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain gary merrill who points up the title 'why are you always trying to push me in the gutter ' he asks andrews 'i have as much right on the sidewalk as you ' br br dana andrew's obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden painful discovery that he is the son of a thief his deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta br br by a twist of irony unique to the film itself dana andrews and gene tierney of 'laura' are united once more and andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later but no longer the romantic beaten down by his job by the cheap crooks this time he goes too far and accidentally kills a suspect the killing is accidental the victim worthless yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail br br using his knowledge of police procedure he covers up his part in the crime plants false clues and tries to implicate a gang leader but cannot avoid investigating the case himself the double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical satisfying and in no way a compromise br br the film is one of the best detective films of the 50's with curious moral values also one of preminger's best br br preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism,1
i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill jackie kennedy's sister and the cousin of these women would encourage the maysles' to make big edie and little edie the subject of a film they certainly could be considered the skeletons in the family closet the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women i'd say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating i e are they nuts or am i missing something this movie is hard to come by netflix does not have it facets does though,1
this wasn't the major disaster that i was expecting but that is about as positive as i can be in my description of the movie i'm not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie but i suppose it's all a matter of taste personally i don't find it funny to watch morons living their idiotic lives or making fools of themselves on television but then again i'm not a fan of jerry springer's pathetic daytime talk show i didn't get too bored watching this but i was definitely never enjoying it either if you're in the mood to see a bad movie but one that isn't too painful to sit through this is a good choice,0
stack should have received the academy award for this performance period its a crime that he did not amazing how he humanizes a rich worthless character br br dorothy malone did earn a well deserved academy award for her performance in fact all of the acting in this film is excellent br br the plot begins with a taxi ride then an airplane ride then keeps moving on an emotional ride that will hold your interest throughout you will be entertained br br however this is only a blatant soap opera one dimensional 100 percent soaper you might call it the ultimate soaper because the acting so thoroughly triumphs over the material excellently acted well directed but strictly within its soap genre i wouldn't even call it a melodrama such as mildred pierce or imitation of life while not denying the great entertainment value of this film you can only imagine what this talented cast and director might have achieved with more substantial subject matter,1
demer daves is a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and broken arrow remains in everybody's mind as far as melodrama is concerned he should leave that to knowing people like vincente minelli george cukor or the fabulous douglas sirk the screenplay is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you are watching such a tepid weepie natalie wood 's character was inspired by fannie hurst's imitation of life see stahl and sirk but who could believe she's a black man's daughter anyway susan kohner was more credible in imitation of life and sinatra and curtis are given so stereotyped parts that they cannot do anything with them the poor officer and the wealthy good looking and mean sergeant guess whom will natalie fall in love with france is shown as a land of tolerance where interracial unions are warmly welcome at the time circa 1944 it was dubious it still is for narrow minded people you can find here there and everywhere,0
good lord what were they thinking here is your spoiler warning even though i don't think it'll really matter you won't be seeing this piece of trash anyway br br a group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies in other words the whole thing is really stupid br br you know it has to be bad when even mike and the bots can't save something and they didn't i know some of their lines were funny like what to add to the sign hit and the hand comments but geez this was pretty dang sad br br all i can say is do not watch this piece o crud it is not worth your eyes,0
rob schneider is a famous comedian cause of his movements facials and performances of not humans this time he is the animal marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked so marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man but on his way to the crime scene he crashes with his car and gets really damaged he doesn't remember what happens and at the next ordinary day his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts of course we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings are useless she is played by collen haskell there are no negative characters the negative character is destiny if i could use this metaphor marvin should find out how to become a normal human being again by the way his animal instincts helps him in some situations schneider's performance is a so so the movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies called mindless fun as i have written above so watch it for the monkey style rob schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that schneider appears in he is a great comedian but this is not his best movie,0
based on fact this is the story of a teenager named homer hickam jake gyllenhaal growing up in a coal town in west virginia where a boy's usual destiny was to end up in the mines but homer had his eye on the sky and a love for flying rockets to the dismay of his mine foreman father and the consternation of the townsfolk generally a misfit for sure he and three of his equally outcast buddies begin making rockets which they fly from a patch of barren land eight miles out of town so as to no longer terrorize the community with their oft times errant rockets unfortunately most of the town and especially homer's father chris cooper thinks that they are wasting their time however the people become intrigued and soon start coming out in droves to watch the 'rocketboys' send off their homemade missiles only one teacher laura dern in the high school understands their efforts and lets them know that they could become contenders in the national science fair with college scholarships being the prize now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars director joe johnston has always been a famous name for his movies such as jumanji jurassic park 3 october sky surely stands above all of his other films without any doubts october sky is his best effort obviously his best film it's not only a true story filmed extremely well but even as a movie it has every single thing which is required for a top level cinema and along with johnston's extra ordinary direction are some exceptional performances jake gyllenhaal was around 19 when this movie was released he gives a beautiful natural performance he is a perfect actor chris cooper as his father also gives a very fine performance the same goes for laura dern also she looks beautiful even the rest of the performances are extremely well the background score was fine highly inspiring movie which lifts up your spirit sky high one of those movies which definitely inspires you for all of your life an amazing inspiring movie along with loads of entertainment not to be missed,1
wow i loved this movie and love judy marte this girl isn't just an awesome pretty face she's funny and really really talented she made me laugh many times just by being very naturally rough with victor who was desperately hitting on her we'll be seeing her a lot in the next coming years and probably also from director peter sollett and co star victor rasuk br br raising victor vargas is one of the best film i saw in a long time very refreshing it's true nice funny well filmed it got it all good story good actors good film direction br br if you like simple slow paced real life urban movies like maybe jersey girl from kevin smith you'll love victor vargas it's better,1

one of the silliest movies of the 1940s an unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring kay kyser kyer orchestra leader and radio star and eternal college fraternity goof off was sort of the precursor to spike jones hamming it up for his guests and backed up willingly by his merry troupe of musicians he's hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion the kind where poison darts imported from africa are framed and hung on the wall the shindig is beset with a creepy judge a scary professor an ominous swami lots of giggly females and enough bad jokes to fill three bob hope pictures the songs by jimmy mchugh and johnny mercer are nothing to brag out and neither is over confident kyser yukking it up with elbow in the ribs material that turns 1940 back ten years from,0
why because for one reason there has never been a more adorable scene in any film than ann margret singing bye bye birdie at the opening she reprises it again at the ending too in a different mood both wonderful rent it and see even if that's all of it that you watch you'll agree i'm sure br br everything about the original was so excellent it just didn't need a remake sorry jason and vanessa gave commendable performances as well as tyne and chynna in fact all the actors and singers in this new version were giving their 'all ' but it's like trying to improve on casablanca it just can't be done it's even annoying finding yourself comparing the two mentally as you try to appreciate the remake and it just falls short through no fault of the actors,0
i rated this movie as awful 1 after watching the trailer i thought this movie could be pretty cool guaranteed to offend everyone the trailer said well it did offend me because this movie really sucks it is hardly a comedy as i laughed about two seconds during the entire movie and what's with all the gays in this movie i'm not gay and i don't have a problem with those who are but what's the point of adding so many gay scenes in a so called comedy movie when these scenes are absolutely not funny i guess the director is a gay man in denial or something like that br br so my advice to you is if you want to waste good money go rent a good comedy you've already seen a million times you'll be better off than watching this mother of all lousy comedy's it really is total crap,0
while being a great james arness western this film has gone down as the worst alamo film ever made the story was terrible inaccuracy all through it and just downright untruths to boot continuity was cast to the four winds anybody catch the cannon sequence the mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes come on then there is brian keith's ridiculous hat costumer must of been away or something or just out of their mind,0
ok first a correction to the tag posted on this movie's main page abe lincoln did not walk with his sister in the movie nor did he stop at his sister's grave the individual in question is ann rutledge who was a very close friend to lincoln in his new salem days some say that ann was in fact lincoln's girlfriend but there is no evidence to support it br br now there are fabrications and fictionalizations in this film hollywood has always taken dramatic license with anything under the sun and young mr lincoln is no exception however the courtroom case that is in the film is based on a real event the accusation of murder against william duff armstrong and even though it's largely fictionalized in this film with lots of name changes it will still have viewers riveted to the screen this is hollywood's golden age with drama at it's finest and henry fonda gives possibly the best lincoln played by anyone,1
this movie has no plot no character development and no budget it really sucks to put it in short terms since there is no development for the movie it really can't even be looked as trying to be artistic or trying to make a statement against torture which leaves two other reasons to possibly watch it to be shocked or to get off on it like a sick little freak well it falls short here too the girl's reactions just seem dumb it's extremely easy to tell that it's fake honestly professional wrestling looks more realistic than the crap they try to get by with in this movie they throw innards on her but she's asleep for most of it so it's just kinda dumb the only really kind of worthwhile part is the end when they quickly cut from scene to scene just before the needle goes into her eye but honestly the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly fake with the exception of the eye if you want a good movie about torture go watch hostel and hostel 2 not only do they both contain realistic violence but there is also an actual storyline that draws you in and makes you care about the people plus the tow movies really work on a deeper level considering themes like american fears of foreigners issues of morality testing how far a person can go human instincts vs civilization and many other things plus they are carefully written and contain some good humor when the story isn't focused on the violence these are much better choices over this piece of crap,0
i read some gushing reviews here on imdb and thought i would give this movie a look disappointed on the plus side the male leads are good and some interesting photography but as a whole this movie fails to convince seems to be full of its' own self indulgent importance in trying to say something meaningful but falls way short and all in all the picture is an unconvincing mess br br it is one of those films classified as a film noir which can be defined as follows br br a film noir is marked by a mood of pessimism fatalism menace and cynical characters br br well that is the story here 3 losers stumble upon each other with their collective problems that include mental illness alcoholism laziness indebtedness etc and together they conspire to kidnap a child and outwit each other br br would have been a much better movie if the story was confined more to the kidnap instead of the character failings of the kidnappers i thought the female lead was way out of her depth and came across as an amateur actress br br whilst some good moments i finished up feeling i had wasted my time br br 4 10,0
my favorite part was when the credits started to roll i wish i could give it a 0000000000001 out of 10 i really wish i had that hour and thirty minutes back don't waste your money or time on it i really could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards br br nadia was really pretty and i hope the movie didn't destroy her career but she chose to be in it br br all in all it sucked more than any other movie has sucked more than kazaam and glitter combined that's saying something br br don't br br do br br it,0
ok i taped this off tv and missed the very start the film was about 10 or so seconds into the titles i assume so if anything happened before that i missed it br br lots of people say mark hammill is in this i didn't see him i did recognise clive barker john landis and obviously stephen king doing some really awful acting as the graveyard attendant br br alice krige looks lovely apart from the scenes where she has the cat face or is in full alien make up br br even with the opening titles it's never really explained very well exactly what sleepwalkers are or where they come from from the title sequence i assume they are catlike bipeds who live by extracting life force from humans i assume they live a long time and these particular 2 are possibly the last of their kind br br add to this a very large dose of incest yes i thought it was a bit suspect too shapeshifting killer cats and invisibility and you have sleepwalkers br br it's a very bad story that has no real explanations behind the main 2 characters and far too many cameo's to try and distract from the simple fact that not enough is explained to the viewer br br avoid,0
i'm fan of art i like anything about art i like paintings sculptures etc this movie shows it so i like it a lot it shows how a woman wants to paint anything about art especially naked bodies but she can't do it because of her strict family father at the beginning of the movie she painted herself naked but she wanted a man for her paintings but her family didn't let her paint naked men because it's against the moral even so artemisia could paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked she falls in love with her art teacher and it seems the art teacher is absolutely in love with her too so at the ending he sacrifices his freedom for hers by lying he said that he raped her but it wasn't true artemisia fell in love with him but if she says that she will suffer a lot because in the trial in which artemisia her father and the art teacher were somebody was hurting her artistic hands to say the truth i think this a great movie about art and an artistic love it's worth watching valentina cervi is great as artemisia she acts very well i also like her performance in the portrait of a lady as pansy osmond 8 5 10,1
probably the most whimsical installment of the first season 'shore leave' has its ups and downs some parts drag on too long and others are unambitiously cut short but one can't deny they threw in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink to make this an entertaining episode kirk and crew seem to have found the perfect planet for shore leave after an extended tour of duty has left everyone on board in need of rest relaxation and so on it appears for all intents and purposes to be an uninhabited earth with beautiful scenery and an ideal climate the first indication that things might go just a little awry is when mccoy leading an advance team spots alice from wonderland following a large white rabbit wearing a vest kirk beams down and finds the others reporting similarly bizarre happenings and encounters the one thing they all have in common is that each crew member was thinking about the person place thing they discovered right before they discovered it this doesn't immediately sink in with kirk or anyone else more strangeness ensues including sightings of don juan a siberian tiger a ww2 fighter plane etc kirk meets up with ruth a gorgeous old girlfriend of course and a bully from his academy days finnegan the chase fight scene with finnegan goes on too long but at the same time mccoy is run through with a lance by a knight on horseback and apparently killed finally an elderly man appears and explains what has been happening the planet is a futuristic 'amusement park' where visitors have only to imagine something to have it appear nothing is permanent mccoy isn't really dead once this is explained kirk decides to order shore leave for everyone after all despite the 'it was all a dream' sort of ending 'shore leave' holds up as another first rate episode of star trek's first season,1
four stories written by robert bloch about various people who live in a beautiful old mansion and what happens to them the first has denholm elliott as a novelist who sees the killer he's writing about come to life some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good the second has peter cushing becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife the third has christopher lee who has a child chloe franks and is scared of her it all leads up to a pretty scary ending although the ending in the story was much worse the last is an out and out comedy with jon petwee and ingrid pitt both chewing the scenery and a cape that turns people into vampires there's also a cute line about christopher lee playing dracula br br this is a good horror anthology nothing terrifying but the first one and the ending of the third gave me a few pleasurable little chills also the fourth one is actually very funny and pitt makes a very sexy vampire also the house itself looks beautiful and very creepy it's well directed with some nice atmospheric touches a very good and unusual movie score too all in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out try to see it on dvd the lions gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound,1
it could have been a marvelous story based on the ancient races of cat people but it wasn't br br this work could have been just that marvelous and replete with mythological references which kept my fascination fueled the lead characters charles brady played by brian krause and his mother mary played by alice krige were shallowly done had no depth of personality and were hardly likable or drawing not even mädchen amick who played tanya robertson 's character fit into that description br br however as i've said many times before when you adapt a stephen king novel for tv you simply must take into account the fact that his books aren't written for tv and his screenplay talent sadly lacks the fire and depth he exhibits as a novelist br br this is another botched attempt to take the magick of stephen king writing whether that is of his novels or an original screenplay to simply cut and paste his work onto the small screen his novels get completely bastardized in the process and all you end up creating is a nice movie nothing less but certainly nothing more his screenplays are hit and miss unfortunately this screenplay translation was a miss br br sorry sorry sorry movie br br this movie gets a 1 0 10 from br br the fiend,0
ok i have read about this film somewhere in the internet and many criticized on how bad and sucks this film was and i couldn't have been more agree about it then after that i saw this film on dvd i was thinking twice about this and then came commercial of this film on tv luckily i spared my money for this pieces of crap i was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film couldn't make me satisfy so i can't be judging on how the film was made but anyway it still sucks as for those who liked this film i would apologize for flaming this film and telling on how sucks this film is i don't know what do you think about this film,0
i believe shakespeare explained what i just read beautifully me thinks he the lady doth protest too much the whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself he sites profane literature writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible a number of times however i can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible anyone can skew data prove anything they like but it doesn't make it true customs change word definitions change over time look at english german where it is very obviously a common root nothing stays the same it's always growing and changing the bible has many different translations but the king james version is the one i've found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research in the king james version you will notice there are certain words written in italics these words have been added by the translators and can be dropped the mean of the entire verse changes writings from around the time of christ were written without spaces without punctuation without paragraphs without numeric verses these writings look like one long word the translators added all of the above for example how would you read this godisnowhere do you read it as god is nowhere or do you read it as god is now here same string of letters two entirely different meanings this is why many biblical researchers use a 'lexicon' to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original arabic greek or hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written it's also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove god exists but you can not prove he doesn't exist in the end i just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty talk about ego putting soapbox away god bless maegi,0
i went to this movie expecting a concise movie relating the effect the son of sam had on the society i didn't expect spike lee to force feed me more garbage on racial tension mob justice or the inability of the common citizen to make a choice under pressure by peers lee has presented an extreme opinion br br the entire movie could have been more effective if in a 90 min format with more focus less tangential sub plots br br don't even bother renting the video unless you passionately enjoy spike lee in such a case the theatre is worth it this is not an escapist movie,0
i never understood why some people dislike bollywood films they've got charismatic actors great dance numbers and heightened emotion what's not to like what i didn't realize was that i had only seen the upper crust of bollywood then i watched garam masala i could tell from the first scene that this was not a movie i was going to like the film opens with a montage of the two leads driving around a city and apparently happening serendipitously on a series of photo setups populated with gyrating models but i kept hoping things would improve sadly they didn't the main problem is that the two protagonists mac sam are completely unsympathetic they spend the entire movie lying to women and lying brutally in order to get them into bed and the audience is supposed to find this funny and be charmed the boys are unscrupulous and inept and not in a lovable way mac even goes so far as to have one of the women drugged in order to keep her from discovering his cheating the script is extremely poor with repetitive scenes setups that never lead to anything and illogical actions and statements by the characters in fact the characters are never really developed at all the males are boorish greedy jerks and the women merely interchangeably beautiful if you go by this movie you would think that air hostesses are pretty easy to pass from man to man in reality betrayal is not so humorous br br the only bright spots i found in the movie were one dance number that had brilliant sets and a few slapsticky moments involving the french farce door slamming aspects of the story but bollywood dancing is better enjoyed in movies choreographed by farah khan and for slapstick you might as well just go straight to the silent comedies of buster keaton and harold lloyd who seem to have influenced writer director priyadarshan not a little priyadarshan also takes false credit for inventing the story the basic premise of the plot is stolen from the 1960 play boeing boeing the original author of that work marc camoletti is credited nowhere at least priyadarshan changed the title for this remake rather than brazenly using the original without giving credit as he did in his 1985 version of this same tale according to imdb's credits list,0
only a handful of the segments are engaging here a segment with a garage attendant from nigeria is heartbreaking one with fanny ardent bob hoskins makes its point twist by twist until the final shot overplays things br br the problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke paris the others are so scatter shot in theme tone volition production that you may as well be watching the years best commercials 2006 it's really all over the place it doesn't develop over it's running time and nothing reigns the directors in no construct successfully joins the pieces tedium sets in i'm at the one hour twenty minute point and elijah wood is in some dumb over commercial overproduced vampire shtick it has about as much to do with paris as old ladies knitting in the antartic fantasy shows up i think first in the coen brothers segment uh thanks j e for ruining another movie and then makes way too many appearances the point of being in paris is that you don't need make believe crap to make your days extraordinary why divide it by neighborhood if quartier de la madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director has there ever been a genre more over represented than the vampire film every three years we get the same lame vampire clichés br br making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless the transitions get lost this doesn't feel intentional it feels sloppy,0
i can't say i liked this movie very much it has some amusing moments but it doesn't seem able to make up its mind whether it is a comedy or a drama it doesn't really work as either it's too light in tone to be a drama and the amusing moments are few and far between it also doesn't make a lot of sense things seem to happen for no reason and it's also extremely convoluted i feel like they just made things up as they were going if they had just taken a bit of time to explain things this might have been a better movie i would say the ending was anti climatic but that would mean the rest of the movie had actually been building up to something which it didn't it just sorts ends and that's that i didn't find it boring really but like i said there there just isn't any point i'll give winter kills a reluctant and weak 3 10,0
watching der himmel über berlin as a teen in the late 80's was a profound experience for me so this was what the movies could be along with paris texas and until the end of the world it still holds a special place in my heart and mind a testament to the genius of wim wenders br br unfortunately later years has seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with million dollar hotel and land of plenty hitting a terrible low point gone are the captivating pictures or music no search for or display of great insight all that is left are characters and thinly veiled political statements that boils down to nothing but clichés and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience br br has the well run dry whatever the reason it's time for mr wenders to either step it up or stop altogether,0

this film is worth seeing alone for jared harris' outstanding portrayal of john lennon it doesn't matter that harris doesn't exactly resemble lennon his mannerisms expressions posture accent and attitude are pure lennon best scene lennon in a local cafe verbally sparring with a stuttering fan as to whether paul mccartney wings' silly love songs is worthy of 1 status in america,1
an older man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse that seems to be wilting he gets pricked by it or bitten by something on it he quickly becomes ill and at the hospital spits out a large writhing white larva of some kind a later attempt to resuscitate him with paddles results in a splatter of blood br br a cop is at the hospital because his partner got badly hurt in a shoot out somehow the cop gets paired up with one of the female doctors as well as an entomologist who is brought in there are several young kids wandering around the hospital who i suppose we're supposed to find adorable but who are extremely annoying little brats they happen to wander into the room where the specimen is being kept and happen to dump a growth hormone on it horror movie logic would say they deserve to die for this but they're never even in any danger br br the critter grows and starts breeding people run away from it and sometimes towards it for some reason the hospital gets surrounded by military who are prepared to destroy everything if need be br br there are no really compelling characters in the movie and most of the time it seems like people are searching around for the monster it was fairly boring clearly it owes something to the alien movies with the monster being born inside a human and having several stages of its growth there's also a character named bishop and the lead actress has sigourney weaver's hair,0
what in god's name happened here how does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of redneck zombies was zombie '90 ever supposed to entertain someone anyone or even make a dollars profit but mainly what happened here br br zombie '90 extreme pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of andreas schnaas who specializes in earth shattering gore films such as goblet of gore and anthropophagus 2000 and some of which contain profanity in the titles in the gore department this one isn't much different than the rest although the level of ineptness well earth shattering br br zombie '90 extreme pestilence is as bad as peter jackson's dead alive is gory think about it br br getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time an accident involving chemicals causes the dead to come back and eat the living never has the concept been treated in such a manner the gore effects are a whole new low just a z grade nightmare i can't tell whether or not this was originally meant to be funny somehow i doubt the english dubbing was being very true to the original script but stranger things have happened the whole thing just reminds me of a shot on video introduction to a troma movie except it lasts a hell of a lot longer br br i've seen only one film that was worse than this the chooper br br for proof that andreas schnaas is an actual director i would highly recommend nikos the impaler if you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie give extreme pestilence a try but you've been warned it takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through but if gore is all you're here for then you might be able to stomach this one other than that no atmosphere no and i mean no budget no entertainment value but mostly no pride show some pride schnaas 1 10 br br updated 7 5 09 after a few more viewings of zombie '90 i've had a change of heart or i guess i just get it now zombie '90 is hilarious so nevermind the harsh words although extreme pestilence still only deserves one star,0
i like the movie twisted desire had jeremy jordan one of my favorite and one of the cutest actors ever melissa joan hart is a good actress i've seen most of her movies but all of jeremy jordan's the thing i dislike about twisted desire is when nick gets arrested and jennifer rats him out twisted desire is my second favorite movie my first is the goonies but i still love jeremy jordan,1
this film is really bad no i mean really really bad tony scott is a terrible director out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state besides that he is one of the worse directors of all time what appalled me the most is richard kelly director of donnie darko did the screenplay to this now richard kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has learnt his lesson br br now i love mickey rourke's new roles but i cant even like him in this because of the terrible story and look of it don't get me wrong i still love mickey rourke but he has made a few accidence's in his time and this is one of them i don't know what to say about keira knightly i think she's a little too overrated i just cant feel for her in films br br all in all this film is bad thats it 1 10 j d seaton,0
this film is a true and historical film it is very useful to those researching the lds church because it is 100 true it is an excellent film and i recommend it br br it is very factual exciting and motivational there are some who think it is not factual but it is br br it is about the restoration of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints and about the prophet joseph smith who restored it it has such events in his life as the disease that he had when he was a small boy his courting emma smith emma his wife giving birth and so on but most importantly it reveals the restoration of the church,1
i have to finish watching a movie once i start regardless of how bad it is this movie was agonizing to sit through the sparkling bullets the reporter with ninja like moves the way the bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and only seem to hit innocent bystanders the predictable outcome and all the bad acting was just horrible like the girl who finds the reporter in her friends apartment and goes from what the heck are you doing in here holding a bat to hey you're cute wanna in like 1 2 seconds just bad save yourself an hour and forty minutes and go play with your kids or dog,0

bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed this shore leave is really tos' first attempt at lightweight sci fi which they would later perfect with the classic trouble with tribbles it gave both the crew of the enterprise and its tv viewers a needed respite from the universe threatening consequences of for example the corbomite manouever br br looking for a place to chill out for a while the enterprise happens across a seemingly idyllic m class planet and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look soon enough all kinds of absurdities begin to take place some seemingly perilous but it all seems a morass of human emotional extremities played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery mccoy has gone through the looking glass psychological thriller kirk is stalked by an indefatigable bully from his past and romantic comedy no comment br br tos was the least serialized of all of the series in the trek franchise so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on heavy handed potentially calamitous drama unlike later series franchise writers tos' production team was not afraid to literally go where no tv series had gone before and shore leave despite its occasional problems is an example my only criticism of this episode is that the cast particularly shatner ironic given his legendary sense of humor didn't seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on st's themes the last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes i can remember from the entire tos run both compositionally and in terms of acting br br 'nuff said my recommendation see it while watching the entire first season as it was meant to be seen it order,1
the last time i saw the movie i was around seven years so my opinions might be jaded over time at the time i enjoyed the filming that switched between cartoon and live action at the time i felt sad for the blue camel and his sad life also i felt glee when after captain contagious kidnapped the heroine a princess or toy shepherdess the tables the were turned on him unfortunately the producers never decided to transfer this movie to vhs so all i have are twenty year old memories i am sure that if i saw the movie again i would consider it corny and sappy but i really enjoyed it the movie at the time,1
i commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a thumbs in the middle review remarking that i'd give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode i've seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in june 2006 and as a lifelong batman fanatic i can say without hesitation this show is utter crap br br everything's wrong with it everything getting past just the lousy animation and design the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories br br and for god's sake is it just me or is the joker in every episode is gotham that much of a revolving door justice system or again is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains see no character development above br br and to make matters worse every single joker tale is the same 3 part formula br br 1 joker gasses people br br 2 joker sets out to gas the whole city br br 3 batman saves the day br br pfeh br br there was one episode i saw that wasn't a joker story the title escapes me but the villain was that nefarious cluemaster the think thank thunk episode with the quiz show that was the single worst batman story i've ever seen heard or read yes worse than i've got batman in my basement br br i can't really say what i feel this show is because it's probably against the tos but it starts with b and rhymes with fastardization thank goodness for the existence of the timm dini etc era of bat entertainment back from the fox and kids wb days stuff that good and i should have known this just couldn't possibly have lasted forever unfortunately,0
like all carnosaur movies this is a joke the way the dinosaurs move reminds me of when my sister plays with her dolls because they cannot be any stiffer or more fake looking than they were br br the plot had no sense whatsoever i mean first they're on a bus then in a warehouse then all of a sudden they're on a boat and let's be serious does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together on a van or on a ship i thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals and now they can fit on a moving van it sounds stupid even when you think about it br br the only reason for which i gave this a 3 is because it's still entertaining i found it better than the first one haven't watched the second yet just don't rent it i saw it on tv and it's a good thing i did because i wouldn't have wanted to waste money renting it,0
i'm a big fan of films where people get conned and house of games is almost the pinnacle of the 'films where people get conned' genre in short it's an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels and never truly revealing what's happening while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you've just seen the film cons the audience on many occasions and despite us knowing this it's still difficult to guess where it's going and every twist comes off as a surprise as mentioned i'm a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler she then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con br br house of games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout and david mamet does well in establishing his film's setting in the underground levels of the city the film is well acted also with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill joe mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film and although his performance is a little under wrought he's always solid and believable as the villain of the piece lindsay crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work and again is believable in her role she may not be the greatest looker but at least she can act the way that the film executes it's plot is the main star of the show however and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer at times it's almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film another thing that's great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons which is useful if you're interested in making twenty bucks say all in all house of games is a truly first rate thrill ride,1
i think phillip kaufman read the cliff's notes version of the kundera novel and then set about making this film okay of course it won't have the punch of the original kundera's novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept his ability to step in and out of stories he constructs this film does not even try the one dream sequence of tereza's so vital to the atmosphere of the book is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever also and this is perhaps a lesser point daniel day lewis looks a lot like ben stiller in this i know it's not really a valid complaint but hey a perfect example of the hollywood izing of otherwise fine literature,0
action violence sex and coarse language are the things that the characters do during the whole movie and everything they do is done without reason mark l lester is un known for his violent without reason movies commando the base the story is weird but stupid the actors play their stupid characters very well i'm not telling they are stupid but i mean they are very bad actors it's another low budget unknown b series action movie if you saw something like operation delta force drive the patriot sanctuary or something like these bad movies from the same kind than misbegotten don't rent it and by the way don't rent any of the movies i mentioned i give it 1and a half out of5,0
this is your typical cheerful and colorful mgm musical from the early '50's and it's definitely on of the better ones to watch out there br br the movie got directed by the genre expert vincente minnelli and stars gene kelly in the main lead both did quite a few movies together back in those days of which this one is probably their best known one br br the movie itself actually managed to win the best picture oscar over the year which meant it beat out movies such as a place in the sun a streetcar named desire the african queen quo vadis the blue veil death of a salesman that year a real accomplishment of course but at the same time also a bit too much credit for this delightful bright and entertaining movie br br when you watch this movie you surely will be entertained by it all which is also thanks to the movie its beautiful color look and the many nice characters within this movie the musical numbers are also all nicely done which is no big surprise when you have people such as vincente minnelli and gene kelly at work br br but really couldn't had everything that got told in this movie been done in halve an hour less or so i mean we already know where the movie is heading to but yet it manages to stretch it out all for as long as possible not that it makes the movie drag in any parts it just makes it a bit overlong the movie could had also definitely been done with a few less musical numbers in it br br one of the better mgm musicals that is not without its flaws though br br 8 10,1
says andy nobody gets hurt everybody wins before he says it we know the opposite is true everybody gets hurt nobody wins this is a new strand in american movies or perhaps an old strand brought back at long last think eastern promises there will be blood no country for old men these movies are dark serious extremely well made and don't care about happy endings i love them before the devil knows you're dead fits the general description but creates an atmosphere all its own kelly masterson's debut script is as close as a hollywood movie will ever get to a greek tragedy paying tribute to fellow veteran director stanley donen sidney lumet expertly and soberly turns the sombre story into an outstanding old school character drama the opening shots although of an obese accountant doggy styling his trophy wife have the look and feel of a dutch master's painting by contrast the drug dealer's condo looks more like a string of mondrians great performances all around only albert finney's character charles feels a little over acted eyes wide and mouth agape almost all the time but then he is in trouble deep deeper than any of the troubles most of us will ever know for compensation marisa tomei is super hot but of course you don't need me to tell you that why her character gina would want to be with a guy like andy we're never told but that's okay action is character after all the unique and magic touch of carter burwell's music makes this fine movie a masterpiece don't miss it,1
val kilmer solid performance dylan mcdermott solid performance josh lucas solid performance three very engaging actors giving decent performances the problem is who cares about the plot john holmes infamous for his well endowments a drug addict and a guy who despite contracting aids continued to make adult films just does not make an intriguing character br br the story surrounds the events leading up to and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder that occurred in the late 80's in los angelos to which holmes was linked arrested and charged with murder and who ultimately was acquitted just like in the case of o j the guilt factor regardless of the outcome ranged quite high in the he did it zone br br there is no one to sympathize with in this film as everyone is a self serving criminal there is just nothing remotely interesting here,0
this movie tells the tender tale of a demented scientist who after his fiance is decapitated goes around ogling strippers so that he can find a suitable body to attach her noggin to everyone in this movie exudes more slime than a snail particularly our protagonist,0
this movie may seem scary on commercials but the actual movie was a reason to vomit this is a below below average even lower than that and has no plot i mean every house can make you feel scared and sure a dead japanese woman would scare the poop out of you but so what make a movie that would appeal to watchers and not just show images of scared people and some hair dead japanese woman can you say horrible rip off of samara the ring don't get me started with the dead child not even that scary so what he has a cat and he can imitate it big freaking deal just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being harmed by the grudge 1 10 yuck,0
this is the first tom hanks movie i have gotten the privilege of seeing in the theater although he is my favorite when i heard he was going to play a hit man i was a little stunned thinking can mr hanks pull this one off and he did in high fashion this 1930's depression era film is a about loyalty redemption and one path that you don't want your children stumbling down tom hanks leads a stellar cast as michael sullivan being the family man and the secret life of the contract killer for the oscar nominated paul newman this movie tom hanks relies more on reaction and gaze rather than dialogue which he delivers a knockout performance br br on one night of one of his jobs michael's son michael jr played by newcomer tyler hoechlin witnesses the hit and michael sr 's partner in crime fellow stage actor daniel craig can't have that information out so he wacks out the son and wife of michael sr except michael jr so the two head for chicago to get conner rooney son of paul newman's mr rooney br br the drama and intense plot really thickens from their as father trys to set things right even though son is along for the ride while on this deadly journey someone has hired a hit for michael sr the assassin would be the photographer of the deceased harlen maguire played by a stain teethed jude law br br the movie will have you feeling the old days and with thomas newman's beautiful and haunting oscar nominated score to go along with it you can't help but appreciate this film from oscar winning director sam mendes so sit back and enjoy the wild ride,1
as a wwii naval history buff and someone who is not proud of this country's history of race relations i was looking forward to seeing this movie what a disappointing piece of schlock i made it about 3 4 of the way through but i should have turned it off at the sub attack scene the idea that a u boat would fire a torpedo at a dde as if there was a hope of hitting it and then be able to run away from the dde while submerged is preposterous and that's just a small detail the whole movie was poorly written poorly directed and poorly acted i agree with others on this board that this could have been a good movie it's as if they decided that since all those crappy wwii propaganda films were made with all white casts they needed to make one with black people and as bad as those old movies were this is actually worse and it almost smacks of false advertising to headline ossie davis and stephen rea it turns out they had very minor roles i have to believe those two fine actors were embarrassed to be associated with this film i'm done i've given way too much of my life this crap movie,0
every so often a movie comes along that knocks me down a notch and reminds me that my taste in films i seek out to watch isn't always impeccable i normally would stay away from stuff like this but i was duped by some glowing reviews and the rohmer pedigree br br there's an initial and intriguing novelty to the production where rohmer essentially superimposes the actors onto painted digital back drops of revolution era france this quickly wanes and becomes about as interesting as watching the paint dry on a paint by numbers scene what we're left with is a boring and stuffy film about aristocrats in 18th century france none of the characters are appealing or sympathetic the pace is so languid the dialogue so arduous and suspense is clearly a foreign concept to rohmer that i ended up not caring whose head rolled who was harboring who or what the devil the revolution was supposed to be about the movie would've greatly benefited from some semblance of emotional build up and a music score there's some fine classical music used at the very end despite being so talky the film plays much like a silent film and the worst kind of film at that a dull and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting subjects only the most astute french historians will find anything to take from this film as it dose seem to paint well known events from a new angle the lady is english and a royalist otherwise avoid this yawner at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia i dozed off twice,0
there's one line that makes it worth to rent for angel fans everyone else this is just a very bad horror flick the female characters are typical horror movies females they are wooden annoying and dumb you are glad when they are killed off long live the strong female character in a horror movie,0
this hamlet made for one of the boringest mst3000 episodes ever i am not a shakespear fan but i do not believe he ever intended his works to be this slow paced and drab it is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are so many hamlets listed like i said though this one is quite boring it is in black and white the pacing is slow and there is minimal scenery the actors are all dubbed too so that doesn't help this is the one mst 3000 i can't watch in one sitting cause the way the guy playing hamlet says his lines can put anyone to sleep,0
this is not the video nastie but only because it came out in 1994 when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in britain it is 75 a rehash of the boogeyman and would have been banned for the same reason whatever that was br br i was initially confused as i thought that annie kelly galindo may have been a different lacey but she was someone trouble by psychic visions of a boogeyman similar to the one in the first film fans will immediately note that they are not the same person br br after seeing a murder in a bathroom and also seeing the address as well annie her psychiatrist and a para psychology student who greatly resembles the guy on the cheap romance novels and butter commercials head to the house and sure enough it's the same bathroom 24 hours later a murder happens just as she described of course we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered br br then the movie shift to a rerunning of the boogeyman story with some extra footage that we did not see in the original notably the boogeyman is shown unlike the original sadly some of the good scenes were cut but 90 of it is there why rerun this film did they find the footage in the trash what was the purpose br br we'll never know and despite the psychologist telling annie she is cured we all know the bogeyman will never die,0
the first half of this movie is a pure delight novel funny wonderful performances a close knit brother and sister living in manhattan fall for the same woman adult bright witty what more could you ask as a romantic comedy this starts refreshing it heads into unexplored territory and then it falls apart br br it goes from being a universal adult comedy to a coming of age coming out of the closet story that has been done many times before what a disappointment as a people film it begins with such promise why does it need to turn into such a pedestrian i am who i am film the freeze frame ending shot of heather graham's jumping in the air to celebrate her happiness at finding herself underlines the banality of the last part of the film br br it could have been different it could have been magical it ended up being the same old same old,0
first i am not really a fan of the whole things eating flesh in disgusting new ways genre of film but i am a bad movie afficionado so my next door neighbor said he had the worst movie ever this one so we start watching it first and foremost it is recorded on a camcorder sans tripod second the voice of the skinny white doctor is dubbed by a large black man third none of the dialogue makes any sense fourth the zombie scenes though unconvincing and chockful of poor makeup and tomato paste lead me to believe the director and my next door neighbor are in need of psychological help it's funny for about 5 minutes but it gets old fast it's so amateurish it's like watching a poorly dubbed high school video yearbook with zombies a note to anyone involved with this movie i want the 20 minutes of my life i spent watching this before i fell asleep back,0
my tutor friend is a well scripted romance comedy movie that has something similar to my sassy girl there's no kissing sex scenes hollywood should learn more from korean productions sex is not always required in a good romantic movie br br the movie is of light hearted tone with occasional cartoon cg scenes blended into the movie i like the part when ji hoon almost kissed su wan the funniest moment is when ji hoon punched su wan's first love because he dumped su wan for another girl and he is going to be a father soon how he became a father was revealed in the next scene which brings smiles to the audience br br mao points 8 10,1
national lampoon's class reunion was a flop when it was released it didn't stay long in theaters in my big city why because it's bad br br not bad in a good way but bad in a really painfully unfunny way the entire cast of actors were mostly unknowns then and have remained unknowns after this turkey br br the idea is actually great a parody of slasher flicks but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect br br just avoid this comedy your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond watching this embarrassing misfire,0
in this day and age of incredible special movie effects this one was a sore disappointment the actors seemed stiff and uninspired as was the dialogue westerns are not common fare for hollywood so much these days but movies like silverado prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one considering that it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing much less creating such a weak film as this one if you love and are looking for a good western keep looking,0
along with darkwing duck this is unfairly cancelled disney has been in decline since tarzan and we need a show like this to get disney back on track ed gilbert and jim cummings were perfect for the voices of louis and baloo sounds familiar the theme theme tune is also catchy out of all the villains which are all great on their own merits tony jay stands out as shere kahn louis and baloo actually sound very similar to the voice overs in the jungle book which isn't a bad thing at all as a matter of fact it's quite inspirational the animation was spot on and the script had plenty of wit that has been severely lacking in animations for years please bring this show back 9 10 bethany cox,1
i usually don't write reviews but i can't understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers since i can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average tv watchers br br i have only watched the first two episodes but those two were so cliché it wasn't even funny any more the same old stories you've probably seen read a couple of times already living toys evil things from other dimensions and it's not just that these stories aren't innovative they are also pretty bad versions of those clichés i'd prefer e g chucky and silent hill over those two episodes anytime and don't even ask about the visual effects the ones in the first episode are alright but the ones in the second awful looks like some film student's project gone wrong blood or gore erm nothing worth mentioning br br it might be interesting for some ten year old kid who probably hasn't seen read that many scary stories yet although i'd rather recommend beyond belief now that's what i call a decent mystery tv show but for an adult horror fan this is worthless i only gave the 3 points because there is in fact some beautiful cinematography especially in the second episode and some nice acting,0
at first i hadn't read the novel so far and i hadn't hear anything about the author yet but as i casually saw this movie i was totally captive by the story already as the jewish watchman primary said that he knows no one who have a bad conscience about the war except from howard w campbell junior was such amazing objective and dissociates from simply moralizing the war terrific and the fictitious story about the most effective spy for the usa in wwii who have lost everything that was important for his life is wonderful emotional transcribed this is the best story about the duality of humanity i've ever heard about the questions this movie is introducing are in my opinion very important for our society when does someone bear the guilt of something what is guilt who is a hero and who is a felon what is important in our life can you live without paying attention to the political changes is the protagonist guilty or not these questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years this is a must see for everyone who have to think about the acception of war this movie is a must see for everyone who meditate what matters in life and what doesn't,1
terminus paradis was exceptional but niki ardelean comes too late we already have enough of this and we want something new br br big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time not behind why people see romania only as a postrevolutionary country br br we are just born not reincarnated and nobody gives a s t anymore about old times most people dont remember or dont want to remember and the new generation of movie consumers dont understand a bit this should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song priveghi maybe younger directors should make the move,0
not that i tinkle myself with glee at the sight of realistic blood shed but when i put a dvd in expecting a bloodbath and what i get is one bloody scene the eyeball at the tail end of asinine fake slapping and spinning in a desk chair i end up thinking well that's 43 minutes of my life gone forever i wouldn't considers this or flower of flesh and blood movies so much as an exercise of will to see if you can sit through them flower of flesh and blood had a few tough spots to watch the devil's experiment did not it was at best stupid and at worst well really stupid perhaps my expectation were too high i put the dvd thinking oh man this is gonna be sick after watching them fake slap the girl about a thousand times i was watching it in fast forward br br two kinds of people would be interested in this film 1 people who seek out f'd up films just to see how f'd up it really is or 2 horror completest i sought this and the other guinea pig films for the latter reason but even if i fell into the category of the former this film wouldn't float my boat as a matter of fact i could imagine this film increasing one's blood lust as in would you just kill the b tch already so in conclusion the only reason to own this film is for collection purposes if you want carnage that traditional horror doesn't provide get traces of death sure that sucks too but at least you'll get the blood and guts you expect br br the only reason i can see for anyone praising this crap is because they feel they're supposed to no artistic merit that i can comprehend no reason for it's notoriety no nothing just a lame attempt to be shocking,0
it ran 8 seasons but it's first in early 1959 and it's last in the autumn of 1965 were shorter than seasons 2 7 cbs chief william paley canceled rawhide's production after watching the 1st show of season 8 in september 1965 because he disliked the series without eric fleming as gil favor who had departed after season 7 the last new episode aired in november 1965 the lone 1966 cbs broadcast on january 4 1966 was a rerun br br i have often wondered why rawhide didn't switch to color filming for it's last season most of the big westerns of the 1960s had gone over to color by 1965 cbs was broadcasting in color that autumn for many of their sitcoms but westerns like gunsmoke and rawhide remained in black and white gunsmoke was the last western and last prime time network series to switch to color on september 17 1966 for the episode snap decision,1
br br there is star trek canon lots of it from canon we know the history of the future advances in technology events places first contacts with new beings names dates etc br br enterprise pretty much disregards much of st canon an unfortunate fact for long time serious fans as one i assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of tos and retro back from there but no br br the phase pistols like much of the technology look much more modern than found in tos an old style starfleet laser gun a slow gold speckle transporter effect that's what i expected to see also i did not expect to hear pure beep based sound effects similar to tng but far apart from tos sound effects br br in the earliest view of tos the original pilot the cage we see a starfleet with a more formal military aspect a bit of old earth navy with enterprise we see a shocking disregard for rank there is more military code in the cartoon star blazers than in enterprise br br it is fine that captain archer is unsure about the needs of the universe quite unlike kirk who never lacked confidence in his application of human justice but inside enterprise everyone seems like an equal unprofessional unsure more distant from the feel of formal military service than found in any st series and that says a lot br br the casual country music opening theme song heralds the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vessel br br enterprise looks to show us a mostly fun warm fuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic bold gritty high rick exploration of space br br i would have selected adrian paul to play the captain and an older human to be the doctor still i liked the actors for the most part linda park an outstanding ballroom dancer from boston college is sure to develop nicely the characters making up the crew seem to be thoughtfully created br br enterprise begins its run stronger than did the past three star trek series let's hope for a good future,1
the wrinkle in time book series is my favorite series from childhood i have read and re read them more times than i can count over the last 35 years the characters with all their virtues and flaws are near and dear to my heart this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful magical spiritual story that i love so much to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement br br if you have never read the book s i imagine you will enjoy the movie the acting is passable the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie and the story is interesting however if you love the books avoid this movie at all costs br br i found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel in an interview with newsweek l'engle said of the film 'i expected it to be bad and it is ' br br i like another reviewer here feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind,0
yes i did as i sit here red faced remembering having felt almost guilty as i watched it a couple of weeks back while my wife chose to watch something as inconsequential in comparison as mommie dearest br br how does one explain the appeal of batman and robin i mean the only ones who ever really counted adam west and burt ward it was a terrible show with terrible plots and terrible acting and oh yes it was terribly funny and the same applies to this reunion and flashback movie adam and burt are invited to an auction where the old batmobile is going to be sold off for charity but it gets stolen and our pals as themselves jump into their old characters' personas if not their costumes and head off to find out what's happened along the way they reminisce about the series and we see how it all came together in flashbacks with jack brewer and jason marsden playing the young adam and burt of the tv series it really was quite interesting to get some behind the scenes looks at the old series and adam and burt just stepped perfectly back into character even though they weren't really in character well you'd have to watch it to see what i mean it was also great to see julie newmar and frank gorshin br br if you're not a fan of the old series you'll hate this if heaven forbid you actually thought michael keaton and george clooney made acceptable batmans then you'll hate this even more but if you grew up with adam and burt and are still willing to admit that you never missed an episode well this one's for you br br yes it's true 9 10,1
don't waste time reading my review go out and see this astonishingly good episode which may very well be the best columbo ever written ruth gordon is perfectly cast as the scheming yet charming mystery writer who murders her son in law to avenge his murder of her daughter columbo is his usual rumpled befuddled and far cleverer than he seems self and this particular installment features fantastic chemistry between gordon and falk ironically this was not written by heralded creators levinson or link yet is possibly the densest most thoroughly original and twist laden columbo plot ever utterly satisfying in nearly every department and overflowing with droll and witty dialogue and thinking truly unexpected and inventive climax tops all 10 10 seek this one out on netflix,1
i am definitely in the minority opinion on this one the hurt locker has won more best picture awards from the critic groups than any other film this year however not only did i not like it i found it hard to sit through br br there is minimal plot and little character development they disarm bombs fight and disarm more bombs that is the entire movie br br but the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and is constantly shaking this has been a recent fad in film making and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap documentary look to it the camera was shaking so much it was making me nauseous to look at the screen br br i normally don't care for war movies and the hurt locker was no exception but you don't need to take my word for it because the critics love it,0
i first saw this movie at the sundance film festival this year and being a teenager myself i found the movie to be quite appealing these kids are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be in a movie of this stature but with the right dialog and junk they made the movie a complete success i enjoyed this movie more then others but i highly recommend releasing and watching this movie it is a mixture of witty comments and hilarious reality capturing the essence of high school high school record has topped my favorites list and hopefully has a chance to be released into theaters i truly thank all of the kids who put the hard work into making this film it helped me cry my eyes our in laughter,1
this is the last dutch language film paul verhoeven made before going on to make mainstream hollywood films basic instinct robocop and total recall among others he sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider catching prey in her web before we meet gerard reve an annoying self centered writer with a morbid imagination gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a literary club meeting in sea side town an hour or so from amsterdam verhoeven lets us have glimpses of how gerard's imagination twists reality asked if writers are a bit close to insanity he admits when he reads the newspaper and it says 'boom' i read 'doom ' when it says 'flood' i read 'blood ' when it says 'red' i see 'dead ' when he tells a story enough times he begins to believe it i lie the truth he accepts an offer to be the overnight guest of the club treasurer a beautiful wealthy salon owner as he gets to know her and learns her husband has died he begins to imagine she is 'a black widow ' is this his more of his reality twist or is she a murderess this is a psychological drama and in recounting which of these old films have stuck in my memory i figured out is my favorite gender looking at his body of work it is seems to be paul verhoeven's too and he is a master in making us question our own understanding of reality it's a nice change of pace from the usual hollywood fare i saw it in 1983 and it is a film that stuck,1
i have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the wrinkle in time chronicles my dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading a winkle in time and would think what an amazing movie this would make sadly enough that screenwriter failed changing characters throwing in lame humor and all out destroying the plot i know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie but why can't you stay true to the book why must you change the way characters think and act for those of you who have not read the book pick it up find a soft couch and let your imagination run wild,0
artimisia was on late last night at first i didn't think i would like it but seeing i didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on i continued watching and felt myself intrigued by the young artimisia a virgin pure and passionate her romance with the older tassi envoked recognisable feelings even though the film is based on a very romantisised level and not reality i loved it a lot more than the usual biographys or costume drama's great play great camerashots great music and texts i loved it and i want more of it,1
this is a very grim hard hitting even brutal film about a death row break that goes awry it's black and white photography keeps it from being dated mickey rooney is excellent as the twisted yet strangely sympathetic lead one of the first movies to portray the psychological desolation of death row it is also quite poignant,1
thanks to this fungal film i do not want my maypo can't stomach the thought of maltex or wheatena and even that granola over there doesn't look so innocent anymore why wasn't the song slop time by the sherrys used as the theme,1
i think that this film was one of kurt russels good movies kurt russel is my favorite actor so i think that he is a good actor in any role he plays but this movie had a lot of action in it and i know that it should have more then a 5 6 out of 10 on the meter but many people did not like this movie oh well i thought it was good so i think that every one should see this movie if you see this movie and like it i think that you should see back draft also with kurt russel i give soldier 1 2 out of,1
sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale you begin to really ask yourself what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low can they honestly expect that we'll endure this many clichés and still be entertained br br of course it is still a hollywood mainstay to make the gun the major character plot device and the source of all conflict and resolution in films character needs a gun gets a gun can't do that because he has a gun puts his gun down first oh my god what are we going to do he has a gun he waves it around acting more malicious than real human beings ever do he pushes it in someone's face for 90 minutes shouting questions the hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens br br it's a real challenge to make such a tired hackneyed formula work again a film has to be very clever and well executed this one is neither it has no life and no personality and it will suck these components from you it will make you feel worse about living in the time and space that you do really who needs that so yes i'll say it i think this may well be the worst film i have ever seen anyone who was involved in the making of this sub mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they've done to us all,0
i was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time the frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension especially when landing yet the specially effects when the krell attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago living in the middle east i saw shades of islam creep in when jj adams suggested alta should dress more modestly and as an engineer was amazed by the imagination used for the 'futuristic' gadgets and gizmos dreamed up by the props department all in all an entertaining hour and a half my first time seeing walter pidgeon and a chance to see leslie neilsen as a 'young' man,1
i saw this movie in 1979 i was 17 or 18 when it was released the theater was perhaps 1 4 full when the movie started ten minutes into the movie me and the friend who went with me to see the film were the only two people in the theater the movie was really weird and had no plot or reason to its script and people demanded their money back we decided to stay for the entire movie why endure such torture here's why we wanted to be true movie critics to have a standard to base all other movies on it is hard to justify saying you have seen the best movie a 10 they always come up with something better but it is easy to be able to base all other movies off of the worst movie ever made and this is it a 1 at best there may be other movies out there that truly qualify as a 1 but i have yet to see them i now base all movies i see on a scale based on this worst i am a true movie critic he he,0
twenty five years ago i showed this film in some children's classes in entomology and can still remember the excitement of the kids they were spellbound it is not just about the termites who have built and live in the castles of clay but also about the other animals who use the mounds there is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights a monitor lizard while a colony of mongooses watch it is a not only good for entomology classes but also for teaching about ecology since there is so much about the interactions between the termites and other organisms and the whole ecology of all of the organisms that live in and around the mounds br br i wish it was available on dvd so that i could watch it again and show others,1
there is no way on earth you are going to care about any of these characters a bunch of spoilt middle class overgrown kids take some drugs at a party and get off with each other and argue i've just seen this on tv and i didn't think it was a 'film' as such more a post 'this life' indulgence that really has no resonance or proper drama to it stuff like this will get commissioned for time immemorial unfortunately irrelevant middle class lifestyle crap that takes itself far too seriously it's got david baddiel in it and that bird out of cold feet you know what to expect there was a lot of this stuff about in 2000 it was a particularly british malaise they're educated and doing drugs friends but kinda dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships sounds great this kind of nonsense and post guy ritchie comedy gangster stuff dark days if you have taste this will annoy you to the point of violence,0
pushing daisies truly is a landmark in television as an art form everything seems to pay homage to amelie and tim burton but so what in a world where fresh ideas are distinctly rare this show will guarantee that you do not care about whether its fresh or not it is just brilliant br br i have been captivated from the start the intelligent writing the directing to the backdrops and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece since the shield and the wire ok not exactly good comparisons but the beauty of pushing daisies is that it has no comparisons on television br br truly addictive and an absolute pleasure perhaps like one of the piemakers pies that get mentioned in such tantalising ways,1
i've seen far too many flicks from this company this one is about middle of the pack one the good side its a bit more stylized and under control than some of their fare less of the sophomoric attempts at humor and more adherence to story for what its worth many of their titles like sexy sixth sense are buried by baaaad performances and an amateurish sensibility on the other side i found the simulated sex scenes not as hot as some of their other flicks like vampire vixens gladiator eroticus spiderbabe or mistress frankenstein br br misty mundae is always a 10 on the peter meter as is darian caine i found barbara joyce hot in a school marm kinda way and ruby larocca a sexy little hottie br br watch this with the remote firmly in your free hand on a night when you need a break from porn don't waste your time wanting to check the story you've got better things to do w your life it is not a movie it's pure t a but not bad by that standard,0
br br step aside for hollywood veterans the wayan brothers were 'asked' thats what hollyweird demanded and thats what it got however like so many of its recent decisions this one was a stupendous mistake br br the director is so out of touch with todays audience attempting to bring back physical pratfalls and gags in place of funny dialogue is just a disaster i knew it the audience knew it and the cast knew it br br what a shame why did they ever consider changing directors not only that but the two wayan brothers played as two of four primary characters without them its just a farce and a sad one br br sp br br,0
in this little film we have some great characters but a very shallow plot it is actually nice to watch because singleton does a great job at presenting the esoteric conflicts and the interpersonal relationships this makes the viewer forget the nonexistent realism that this movie supposedly is for in fact what we have here is all the possible cliches and stereotypes put on celluloid in a rate higher than that of a soap definitely not a deep movie even if it wants to be but better than an average college movie,1
how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long it's terrible it makes me want to shoot someone it's so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci fi movie i'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought hey this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table br br please people stop watching this and all other reality shows they're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create,0
despite some mildly thought provoking oddities in the script and the film's overall curiosity value fury of the wolfman emerges as a dull uninteresting excursion into lycanthropy saved only by the statuesque presence of villainess perla cristal the rest of the players including the hammy naschy are a complete write off though admittedly none are helped by often atrocious dubbing although the screenplay packs in enough variations on werewolf frankenstein dr moreau themes to flesh out a dozen movies the plot is so unevenly developed the characterizations so feeble and the dialogue so verbosely ridiculous at least in the english version that any latent interest in the turgid proceedings is soon quashed br br zabalza's direction seems jerky even amateurish his staging is clumsy and ineffective he is not helped by villasenor's over bright lighting even promising sets are so unatmospherically photographed that the director's few attempts to give the audience a fright are signaled far in advance br br other credits fall into a similar pattern of ineptitude though the stridently over emphatic music score and the laughably crude totally primitive special effects deserve special condemnation,0
i don't know what movie some of these other people watched but they must have seen a different joseph smith prophet of the restoration than the one i saw br br i think the movie was both well done and inspiring i think it's definitely worth watching it's apparent from the outset that a lot of care went into the making of this film the background scenery is beautiful br br i think the film does a good job of portraying joseph smith both as a man and as a prophet joseph's spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and reverence br br i would definitely recommend watching this movie,1
another movie to suffer without an adventure to run no enigma to solve just an illness man acting like an animal no a good reason to take this journey pitt and lewis are great actors magnificent michelle forbes but a weak david duchovny performance,0
put quite simply this film is terrifying br br it starts off simply looking like a study of a rebellious young girl and goes on to become a beautifully crafted horror film br br don't expect gore or zombies this is psychological and just as he would also do in candyman bernard rose manages to convey the horror that is not being believed br br each time you watch this film you realise more about what's happening and about how the two worlds in this film interconnect br br drawings have never been scarier,1
two years passed and mostly everyone looks different some for good and some for worse i still enjoyed as much as i did the original though br br some flaws they had though like changing the joker he now has no red lips and looks like more blackish hair and black pupils hes still voiced by mark hamill which is a plus i guess they made poison ivy more white hinting that she is becoming more like a plant and catwomen looks much different and not as attractive as she was in the original br br though costumes like batman batgirl killer croc and scarecrow look badass especially scarecrow br br the show isn't as dark as the original because batman doesn't work as alone as he used to most of the time working with batgirl and the new robin tim drake while nightwing dick grayson comes to the rescue often batman gave up the yellow logo and with the black wing on his suit and seems like he got a bit bigger but still kicking tons of ass br br the show isn't as good as the original mostly because of some of the revamped characters but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite over the edge might be one of the greatest batman episodes ever so make sure you check that out br br overall 8 9 10,1
an illegal immigrant resists the social support system causing dire consequences for many well filmed and acted even though the story is a bit forced yet the slow pacing really sets off the conclusion the feeling of being lost in the big city is effectively conveyed the little person lost in the big society is something to which we can all relate but i cannot endorse going out of your way to see this movie,0
in 2006 the ampas awarded one of the most innovative documentaries depicting wildlife in the coldest place on earth that film was march of the penguins narrated by academy award winning actor morgan freeman br br walt disney studios has had a monopoly on the animated circuit for decades now they've taken their stabs at live action film making and it's been hit and miss all across the board disney then created a sub division called disneynature and release its first feature film titled earth this is absolutely one of the most touching and informative documentaries i've seen in quite sometime br br narrated by the great james earl jones earth doesn't offer anything new to anyone who has watched the discovery channel in the past five years or follows the global warming crisis very closely earth touches very deeply on the issue and takes a very liberal approach on the subject matter br br it enables an emotional connection to nature that i haven't experienced before it also shows not only the beauty and mystifying parts of our gorgeous planet but the grunt and disturbing aspects that it often entails it's one thing to watch mufasa fall from a cliff in to a stampede or bambi's mother be shot by a hunter in the middle of the woods it's all good because at the end of the film we know it is just that a film this shows penguins polar bears elephants all types of families from all walks of life living and dying in their natural habitats these real things make a real movie experience br br though a bit heavy weight on the graphic nature of the film which many people will disagree earth is a touching experience there is stunning cinematography work here by a great camera team and an amazing score by george fenton in comparison to march of the penguins or grizzly man it doesn't really hold any measure but it stands great on its own at the end of the day you grow an appreciation of our planet and a bit of sadness as many of us will probably never get to visit these places we'll witness in the film we live here yet it's like we never get to explore the planet for one reason or another earth is beautiful br br,1
as of this writing john carpenter's 'halloween' is nearing it's 30th anniversary it has since spawned 7 sequels a remake a whole mess of imitations and every year around halloween when they do those 'top 10 scariest movies' lists it's always on there that's quite amazing for a film that was made on a budget of around 300 000 and featured a then almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent i could go on and on but the big question here is how does the film hold up today and all i can say to that is fantastically br br pros a simple but spooky opening credits sequence that really sets the mood an unforgettable and goosebump inducing score by director co writer john carpenter and alan howarth great cinematography stellar direction by carpenter who keeps the suspense high gets some great shots and is careful not to show too much of his villain good performances from the then mostly unknown cast a good sense of humor michael myers is one scary evil guy a lot of eerie moments that'll stay with you the pace is slow but steady and never drags unlike most other slasher films this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a big body count br br cons probably not nearly as scary now as it was then many of the goofs really stand out br br final thoughts i want to start out this section by saying this is not my favorite film in the series i know that's not a popular opinion but it's really how i feel despite that it truly is an important film that keeps reaching new generations of film buffs and just because it's been remade for a new generation doesn't mean it'll be forgotten no way no how br br my rating 5 5,1
maybe this isn't fair because i only made it about halfway through the movie one of the few movies i have actually not been able to watch due to lameness br br the acting is terrible the camera work is terrible the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy for example during a coke deal the coke is just kept loose in a briefcase i'm no expert but i think people generally put it in a bag br br they use the same stupid sound effect whenever a punch is thrown it's that over the top 'crunching' sound and they use toy guns with dubbed in sound effects br br worst movie ever,0
my god buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best movies i've ever seen closer to peter greenaway and jean luc godard's movies this one is really disturbing but not gruesome as the nekromantiks all the little stories have a deep philosophic interest and the directing is totally inventive in spite of the lack of money see the bridge sketch highly highly recommended,1
i enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued about this female painter i had never heard of before so i set out exploring her life and work afterwards as could be expected i found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate i was a little astounded however by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy come on guys a film isn't and shouldn't be a biography nor a novel any historical film distorts reality because it should be a work of art in its own right a film director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own artemisia is a wonderful film and i think it brought many people including some that now give negative comments to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist,1
when i read other comment i decided to watch this movie br br first cast specially michael madsen and tamer karadagli good enough br br film very intelligence and interesting because cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and russsia br br second story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you'll like in my opinion br br third final chapter is not special or interesting it's regular like other action movies br br finally i recommend to watch this movie and i hope you'll love it enjoy d,1
bonjour tristesse covers similar ground as 'the member of the wedding ' to wit a possessive daughter tries to prevent a relationship from forming between a beloved family member and an interloper while critics love 'member of the wedding ' i find julie harris to be a jumbo drag and an adenoidal scenery chomping thespian in everything she's been in this portrays irritating rich idiots as in last year at marienbad but this time it's a travelogue br br in this preminger movie sequences develop but characters do not for the first 30 minutes he's content to blur the father daughter relationship between seberg and niven making uncomfortable sexual readings possible once the conflict is introduced seberg can't deliver the depth the part requires kerr pulls rank and turns the film into 'endless love ' seberg's vacuous narration is like something out of strange interlude it is not good i really wish someone other than niven was in his role he spends so much time normalizing orthodox british behavior in all his movies he never gets around to the character br br in the most memorable sequence an evening out dancing becomes a free for all in a harbor bertolucci steals the entire scene for his empty exercise 'the conformist ' kerr is on board to clasp her hands and portray another major pain as in black narcissus night of the iguana king and i heaven knows mr allyson tea and sympathy etc etc really kerr was a horrible actress i wish every movie with her could end with a fatal car crash or even better start with one br br people uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this,0
this film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities it's like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula 1 grand prix not i might add the us grand prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win that is how far short this film falls now don't take this the wrong way i love b movies around half my collection is made of b movies but i don't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film is br br first of the story for a b movie isn't that bad it has potential there to make a b movie brand were not talking friday 13th potential but potential none the less but what really lets this film down is the acting at not one second do i believe anything it's like watching qvc except the presenters on qvc tend to have a heavier tan br br in summary i'd like to say i've seen worse films but i can't,0
i've always liked this john frankenheimer film good script by elmore leonard and the main reason this wasn't just another thriller is because of frankenheimer his taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference he even hired porn star ron jeremy as a consultant you can make a case that its the last good film roy scheider made i've always said that robert trebor gave just a terrific performance clarence williams iii got all the publicity with his scary performance and he's excellent also but i really thought trebor stood out frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail murder sex drugs and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts what can you say about a film that has ann margaret being shot up with drugs and raped a guilty pleasure to say the least vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young kelly preston makes an early appearance a classic exploitive thriller that shouldn't be forgotten,1
hard to believe that director barbet schroeder once did the majestic and very funny maitresse 1976 and now only seems to do by the numbers hollywood thrillers br br this is very lightweight john grisham material crossed with the plot of a tv movie bullock is cass mayweather a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy and together they make an uncomfortable duo not good when two unbalanced college maladriots gosling and pitt decide to send them on a wild goose chase by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene br br fair enough but while bullock and chaplin fail to create any sparks we also have to endure a several dull overly melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in cass's history then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff side log cabin where there's absolutely no doubt the ott ending will be set oooh the atmosphere br br watch any episode of csi instead it's to the point and far more exciting,0
it is only robert de niro film which i really hates it is stupid film with horrible acting of course not de niro for me brian de palma must do his mafia films as always like scarface 1983 or the untouchables 1987 i also loved de palma's mission impossible 1996 de niro worked with palma two different times too greetings and the wedding party i though that the wedding party was ok too i didn't watch greetings br br screenplay is really bad and unfunny there are no any scene where i can smile for even one time film lost a chance to be a funny style even a little bit in a be black baby scene and also i don't like the scene where a guy's sexual organ appeared so it is one of the worst film i have ever seen just worst i hate that,0
how sad to see the beautiful and talented tina louise reduced to making this horrible excuse for a film tina still looked fit and attractive but for some reason seems truly frightened i can understand her fear fearing that this 3rd rate stinker would somehow be released to the general public also i'm a fan of the likable adam west again as with tina adam looks good and in great shape for a man his age his acting here is passable but the script is so bad that it's difficult to even listen to the dialog br br the movie is a rip off of the classic brando biker flick the wild ones out law biker gang is out of control in a small hick town the bikers here look like a motley group and i sure wouldn't want them to date my sister the acting is stiff and wooden and the story plot is as old as sand hellriders is hell to watch,0
beware spoilers this movie was okay goldie hawn and chris sarandon were the best two in it okay so the goofie foreign guy who spoiler here trades with the biker for his clothes was funny this guy's boss was good too but the movie really belonged to sarandon and hawn these two should have had a lot more time on screen together they're chemistry was great the bathroom scene wow romantic sweet yummy br br hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians to talk about sarandon would be to give a lot away spoilers this is a rather untypical romantic political comedy and it satisfies both somewhat the political side a whole lot more than the romantic it touches on political issues and just barely skims on romantic areas br br,1
i feel this is one of the best movies i've seen i'm an older male and love most westerns i love movies based in part at least on facts if i am not mistaken this is such a movie i also like revenge type movies this qualifies there as well in my opinion some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the whipping and the barn shooting scene i felt the corral beating scene was a little overkill but did not affect how i feel about the complete movie i saw what i think is a continuation of this movie in a gun smoke episode i also enjoyed that i recommend taking the time to watch this movie i will watch it again i also felt the romance parts of this movie were well played i thought it was so out of character for randy travis to play a villain type but i always enjoy his acting,1
this movie was two and a quarter excruciating hours someone please tell me what the point was br br i mean i understand the historical setting it's supposed to be about a ragtag group of confederate bushwhackers terrorists on the missouri kansas frontier taking revenge against all northern sympathizers and abolitionists during the u s civil war but aside from gratuitous violence there wasn't really much of a point to this movie perhaps it was a political statement that war is really nothing much more than gratuitous violence if that was the point it was done quite well but i don't think that was the point i think the producers really thought they were making a worthwhile movie here but as far as i was concerned there was a complete lack of any plot it seemed like i was watching a paperback novel come to life with the characters looking like what you would see on the covers of such novels br br this movie should be burned along with some of the towns this gang torched,0
many moons ago when i was seven years old i can vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie it appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and i decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie being the wise adults that they are they told me absolutely not it's a bunch of trash of course i was very disappointed that i would not be the first kid on my block to see the incredible melting man br br little time passed maybe a couple of days i forgot about the incredible melting man and my disappointment faded twenty five years passed until it re entered the forefront of my thoughts while surfing through channels on digital cable i found this long lost relic of a movie my curiosity was piqued and i decided to finally partake in this fruit forbidden by my parents i should have listened to them the incredible melting man is perhaps the worst movie known to man it makes movies such as def con 4 metalstorm and freddie got fingered look like oscar nominees i feel violated for wasting almost two hours of my life watching this vile filth the story was incoherent and the effects were crude even for 1977 how anyone convinced a film company to produce this movie beyond me br br don't make the same mistake that i did listen to your parents if they forbade you to watch this movie they were right,0
this might be the worst film ever made and is possibly worth seeing for that reason alone streisand is laughably unbelievable as a young woman posing as a man in order to study judaism the soundtrack is torturous featuring barbara belting out some of the weakest blather ever put to film and don't even get me started on the plot you will actually get more chuckles out of this film than many comedies because it is soooooooo terrible the rampant ego of streisand thinking she could somehow raise this stinker to oscar heights led to this disaster i'm pretty sure the novelist isaac bashevis singer hated this film and never forgave streisand i can't blame him this movie is like watching a car wreck in slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack of 'the sound of music' being played backwards on an old turntable it's truly that bad i'm amazed that anyone from streisand enjoyed this movie on the level that it was intended,0
ziab la ta'kol al lahem is an awful movie this is only a superposition of scenes without a clear link acting is also very bad despite the presence of a good actor like ezzat el allayli but something is really astonishing in this movie talking about sexuality emancipation of women nude scenes are very rare in arab cinema even in this days i really congratulate the director and the actors for their courage we want to see more of this style in egyptian movies but with better quality the reasons that led me to vote this film as an awful one are not only scenario and acting but also the lack of prfessionalism this movie look like an amateur one we can see a lot of errors in the screen if you want a good arab movie ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not the one recommended but if you wish to encourage the uncensored movies in all the arab world watch it and make your friends and your family do the same,0
this is still the benchmark to judge all golden age whodunnits by and taking into account the limited technology and dubious ethical standards of the authorities on screen bears up well against all generations of similar attempts since on film and tv fast and furious with plenty of warner bros wipes and thankfully no time for a love interest it gallops along taking the splendid cast with it to the violent end i never understood why the da had to trail vance around everywhere i always thought they were deskbound palette as the detective but especially girardot as the doctor are delightfully eccentric and un pc when glancing over the second murder victim he sniffs that there were too many people in the world anyway of course it is william powell as philo vance and michael curtiz as director that makes the film what it is when did powell ever make a dud br br the army of cops at the crime scene didn't really do a very good job in finding the second dead body and unconscious dog did they the best bit is where vance narrates to us all the sequence of events surrounding the murders dodgy model sets combine with fantastic roving camera angles to produce a very modern feel and startling with what has gone before the only problem is as usual the conclusion can't match the overall deductive processes displayed throughout and a somewhat contrived ending is invoked some chan's moto's and many others of course could only be concluded this way too but because it happens so fast and is slightly dubious morally it doesn't lessen my opinion of kmc's status as a classic br br all the prints i've ever seen of kmc are at worst like looking into a goldfish bowl so if you're interested in seeing it bear with it until you're sucked in,1
i have spent the last week watching john cassavetes films starting with 'a woman under the influence' and ending on 'opening night' i am completely and utterly blown away in particular by these two films from the first minute to the last in 'opening night' i was completely and utterly absorbed i've only experienced it on a few occasions but the feeling that this film was perfect lasted from about two thirds in right through till the credits came up everything about this film from the way it was shot the incredible performance of gena rowlands the credits the opening the music the plot the sense of depth the pace the tenderness the originality the characters the deft little moments for me is truly sublime i couldn't agree more with the previous comment about taking it to a desert island because the sheer depth of this film is something to behold if your unlucky enough to have a house fire i guarantee that instead of making a last ditch attempt to rescue that stash of money under your bed you'll be rescuing your copy of this film instead,1
i saw this movie with some indian friends on christmas day the quick summary of this movie is must avoid jp dutta wrote directed produced and edited this movie and did none of these jobs well br br the movie tells the story of the attempt by pakistan in 1999 to capture part of the disputed region of kashmir from india supposedly based on fact you get a hint from this movie of the difficulty the indian army had in recapturing the area from the pakistani troops who occupied the high ground but instead of telling what must have been a compelling and heroic story all this movie does is make the indian military look laughable and stupid which i know is not true br br i watched this movie with an almost completely indian audience who were very patriotic and clearly wanted to like this movie but also found themselves laughing at scenes that weren't meant to be funny br br the script was absolutely abysmal it gave the impression that mr dutta knows nothing about how an army operates and was using bad war movies for reference the result is a script that is brainless and repetitive br br the acting from most of the principals was not stellar but considering the script they were given i find it hard to criticise them too much as for the supporting cast all i can say is that i hope they were amateurs br br the editing was also pretty bad it was pretty hard to follow what was going on for a lot of the time and music would abruptly end at scene changes br br good things the cinematography was pretty good although it was hurt a little by the fact that the movie didn't appear to be colour corrected the colour balance often varied significantly within scenes also the few songs that were in the movie were quite enjoyable for the first half a dozen or so verses at least unfortunately they went on a lot longer than they should have br br and the worst crime of all this mess is four hours long there is enough here that a good editor could almost squeeze a good 1 5 2 hour movie out of what was shot sadly a good editor was not working on this movie,0
the movie is basically the story of a russian prostitute's return to her home village for the funeral of a sister friend there are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken but they are not fully explored the core of the movie is the funeral wake and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable apparently the movie is unedited the prostitute's journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud maybe that's supposed to impress us with the immensity of the russian landscape the village itself such as it is is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male the consort of the dead girl continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible most of the film is shot with a hand held camera that could induce nausea another problem for western viewers is that subtitles don't include the songs and laments of the crones don't go to this movie unless you're fluent in russian,0
so i consider myself pretty big into the anime scene with very few shows i simply will not watch br br this show however i would recommend to anyone br br quite possibly the most original series to date it s got just about everything i could ask for a side story so to speak about an unconditional love that will not be admitted to a very blatant comedy and a very well put together voice acting cast both japanese and american translation br br if not for the terribly funny aspect to it it would be just another anime br br more or less as i have noticed a 'love it or hate it' very few people i have seen introduced to this series will end up with a distaste for it br br original to the core with everything you could ask for in an afternoon bet the house on this series i'm ready to assure you that you will enjoy it,1
neat premise very unrealistic what i learned from this movie is that speeding crazily out of control to go to the weekend cabin may not be the best idea after all i loved how bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the hill with no injury at all unfortunately the same can't be said for his gal oh and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wreck br br lots of dragged out scenes including a plain stripper still have nightmares from that scene poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand i admit i was intrigued to see what the mysterious thing was behind the door but when it appeared i just laughed ha ha ha the girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived personally i really would want a new body after an excruciating experience like that,0
street fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire this is not a movie you just watch for fun it is not a comfortable experience although it does have some laugh out loud moments this is a movie you watch when you need food for thought br br to dismiss this film as simply racist is to miss the point entirely this is not only a satire of song of the south it's also a biting commentary on the prejudices that americans still have as a society every ethnic group portrayed in the movie gets shown as grotesque caricatures of their stereotypes which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people through this wild exaggeration the filmmaker shows just how absurd these tightly held beliefs really are br br if you're the sort of person who's willing to acknowledge the ugliness of the prevalent prejudices american culture still holds and if you're not afraid to look your own prejudices in the eye this movie may be for you,1
whatever you become in your life you must never forget that you have roots this is the story of true facts that was made into a beautiful and moving movie i dare to say that this movie is well underrated this shows us a reality of life the more evil surrounds you the better person you become trust in your instincts and be aware that the ideal of life is to live it happy without grudges without living under a rock the movie concept is more that interesting connecting the storytelling with real life events keeping us aware of everything from facts to emotions bless these people and make everyone happy see it i recommend it to all young people it's not about racism it's about how to live your life,1
canadians are too polite to boo but the audience at the toronto film festival left the theater muttering that they would rate this film 0 or 1 on their voting sheets the premise is that a modern filmmaker is interpreting a 17th century fable about the loves of shepherds and shepherdesses set in the distant past when druids were the spiritual leaders working in three epochs presents many opportunities to introduce anachronisms including silly and impractical clothing and peculiar spiritual rites that involve really bad poetry lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct from which cross dressing and assorted farcical situations arise the film could have been hilarious as a monty python piece which it too closely resembles but rohmer's effort falls very flat the audience laughed at the sight jokes but otherwise bemoaned the slow pace the ending comes all in a rush and is truly awful this is a trivial film and a waste of your movie going time,0
judy davis shows us here why she is one of australia's most respected and loved actors her portrayal of a lonely directionless nomad is first rate a teenaged claudia karvan also gives us a glimpse of what would make her one of this country's most popular actors in years to come with future roles in the big steal the heartbreak kid dating the enemy risk and the acclaimed tv series the secret life of us incidentally karvan as a child was a young girl whose toy panda was stolen outside a chemist's shop in the 1983 drama going down with tracey mann if this films comes your way make sure you see it rating 79 100 see also hotel sorrento radiance vacant possession lantana,1
i chose this movie by the cover which was a bad move it wasn't funny at all and the main characters were obnoxious the girl was beautiful but the story and the acting were terrible it had absolutely nothing to do with surfing terrible movie with a surf theme that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers catherine zeta jones was beautiful and the movie will probably see a resurgence just becuase she is in the limelight now being married with gordon gekko and all but if you haven't seen it don't waste your time a bad movie with great surfing real surfers and amazing beautiful cinematography was in god's hands,0
i saw this movie a few days ago what the hell was that br br i like movies with brian o'halloran they are funny and enjoyable when i saw a name of this title and genre i thought great this one could be really good some parody for slashers or another gore movies but then i read a preview and thought right it could be good anyway but it wasn't br br my opinion if like movies they look little bit like documentary with little bit of comedy try some moore's movies or alien autopsy they are really about something this one was empty br br and put a comedy to title no comment really bad joke,0
these things have been floating around in my head for damn near 10 years now some pieces of this work were really memorable id love to see another more current example of cg showy offy stuff actually i'd love to be part of it br br if i'd would of had the chance to just say what i wanted and thats it i wouldn't have to write all this extra in order to make 10 lines if text as this website requires i mean really this almost discourages me i mean luckily for the guys that made the movie i really liked the minds eye and it took me 3 times to have enough lines i hope you don't get me on the misspelling yup you did,1
i only recently found out that madeleine l'engle's novel had been turned into a tv movie by disney and ordered the dvd the book was a favorite of mine when i was a child and i read it several times br br despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel the murry family is well cast with a likable if too pretty meg at the center and a charles wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating br br the first half hour is promising enough doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene unfortunately as soon as the non human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart alfre woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric mrs whatsit think miriam margolis or joan plowright instead and kate nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive she must have visited faye dunaway's plastic surgeon in recent years for some reason they make her mrs which look like glinda from the wizard of oz when she should have resembled a benign wicked witch of the west br br in the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction i understand that this is a tv movie but the cgi looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier mrs whatsits' centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the chewbacca like suit for aunt beast who in the novel is a velvety elegant creature instead of the ungainly big foot like thing shown here i could go on and on nearly every artistic choice is a disaster presumably because there wasn't a large enough budget to do this justice but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement br br this really would have needed the sense of wonder spielberg brought to his early films what a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children's literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting a wrinkle in time and it's sequels for the big screen giving it the scope it deserves,0
to the small minority seen here praising this film get serious i know it's down to peoples personal opinion at the end of the day but anyone with more than a couple of brain cells can surely see that this is total rubbish so bad it does not deserve to be part of this franchise i can only assume those saying how great this is are friends with somebody involved in the film and are trying to give their career a push poor in every way don't con people by saying otherwise storyline is a weak rehash of the previous entries script is likewise attempts to hide the lack of originality by using a girl instead wow don't disguise the film makers lack of ideas and there is sadly a complete lack of any scares absolutely no redeeming qualities utter utter turd i've awarded this pair of chancers one mark simply for having had the nous to get someone to fund this piece of crap they must have put more effort into that than they did into actually making the film shame,0
well i too had heard read all the breathless reviews and comments about how this movie might deserve the best picture oscar so i went to see it today what a major disappointment 1 if you read the other reviews you will learn from members of the u s military who served in iraq how unlikely the events of this movie are they mirrored my own thoughts as the movie played i a complete civilian kept thinking to myself say what there's no way that would happen like that 2 there's very little that actually happens in terms of plot a new bomb disposal guy shows up to replace one who was killed a death that isn't really clearly explained the new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work his attitude puts others at risk that's it 3 this movie is nowhere near as suspenseful as claimed if you want suspense try one of the bourne movies if you want to see a war movie that's emotionally powerful try renting go tell the spartans which is about the vietnam war and stars burt lancaster who told me personally in a serendipitous supermarket encounter that it was a film he was immensely proud of and one he viewed as some of his finest work and which he was still upset had been largely ignored in the wake of the over hyped apocalypse now or an old wwii black and white classic sink the bismark which especially for an english film is unbelievably heart wrenching don't waste your time on hurt locker,0
the straight story is the tale of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state line he decides to make the trip on his lawnmower as he can't drive and he wants to make the rip by himself the film beautifully depicts his journey and the lives he touches along the way br br richard farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast most notably sissy spacek in an endearing performance as his daughter and harry dean stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role br br at first i felt that a story of an old geezer trip across the country side would be dull but i soon discovered that lynch with all the insights in to the man life makes this a movie i would recommend to anyone,1

contrary to another reviewer i think that this is well written especially the more fictional it is because greater imagination would be required and well acted because there were no other characters with whom to share the focus of these dozen minutes plus well done monologues but i'm just not entertained by such solemn pious rememberances everybody has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others everybody has problems and some are more intense than others these are just ten not very atypical stories and problems exemplifying how anybody's life or part of it is fodder for film then again i think poorly of tv's reality shows too so if that's your bag you may like this it's the kind of stuff that would make for good 'phone and or internet gossip but absolutely without other than verbal action and although each of the speakers is female i'm gonna leave gender outta this,0
always enjoy the great acting of drew barrymore and her great performance in this film where she plays a very very complicated young gal holly gooding skipped parts 2000 who leaves new york and travels to california and shares an apartment with a up and coming writer george newbern patrick highsmith far harbor '96 many strange things start to happen to holly and she seeks to find her brother in a mental institution after he killed her father if you look close enough you will actually see the mother of drew barrymore in real life appear as her mother in this picture if it was not for the good acting of drew barrymore and george newbern this film should be seen only on halloween night however it sure has it's surprises in the end,1
with all the european studios involved in this one you would think you'd at least get some pretty photography but the local color is kept to a minimum br br irritation 1 is mira sorvino using a russian accent in order to play a spanish cop wtf the story is hopelessly confused there's a supposed romantic back story that is intentionally confused is she or isn't she a lesbian serving no purpose whatsoever the cops in the movie are the most stupid to have graced a serial killer film in a long time there seems to be some message about the mid '30s spanish civil war but since pretty much everybody involved in that is dead one doesn't see the point in it br br despite the bull fighting backdrop of part of the narrative which part who can tell you never even get a good look at a bull fight earnest hemingway would have punched the director in the nose with my blessings,0
cat soup has two hello kitty type kittens embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife where anything can happen and does this mind tripping asian short uses no dialog substituting word balloons instead there is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to see it for yourself and make sure no one under 10 is in the room dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes honest perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in and also ride but like practically everything else in this film that silly picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end,1
wow who ever said that edward d wood jr never influenced anybody this steaming pile of donkey excrement is a perfect case in point it makes the violent years look like casablanca santa claus also makes keith richards' worst flashbacks look like my first nocturnal emission i've had nightmares you know waking up and sweating bullets that will never come close to the visceral terror that santa claus unearthed from the seemingly pure soil of my very being however i can think of some parties where this film might actually go over well also if you're looking for the perfect example of a santa satan dichotomy on vhs tape look no further don't check out this movie as i've been notified the mst3k version is now available move over satan here's santa claus,0
a below average looking video game is turned into some sort of conspiracy to have the next terrorist discovered in the usa backyard welcome to the lunacy of cheaply made direct to video movies its full of no name actors and actresses with little valuable plot br br anyway this strange game goes on and our hero bets real money and does good at it it is sort of like gambling except the gambling part is gone and it sucks instead its an online game with little real value and you get authorities on your tail if you do good br br what makes it even stranger is that two strange computer programs battle it out somehow and all is saved in the end i will leave the viewer to see how it all comes to fruition br br overall not even worth a 1 rental borrow it please d,0
david duchovney creates a role that he was to replicate somewhat in californication the troubled talent and it is a role he plays well br br this thriller starts off at a good speed and carries you through to the end timothy hutton plays a fine villain and angelina jolie pouts the story of a disgraced doctor finding his way into a criminal world is well scripted drug addiction and a desire for the sultry jolie mix a heady cocktail unfortunately towards the end the story gets a little weaker and the relationships between villains and the fbi is muddled and rushed as if it was created only to develop the final scene but that aside a movie worth seeing,1
this has some excellent spots but the length of the film can not sustain the wafer thin plot it is another sailors on leave film zippier than astaire's 'follow the fleet' but not as good as 'on the town' br br kathryn grayson is bland but kelly and sinatra work well together their 'if you knew susie' number is hilarious as they make up the song as they sing it 'i begged her' is also fun with sinatra showing how adept he was at hoofing sinatra's solo songs are dull and seem to be inserted to show off his singing rather than as part of the story fortunately there are accomplished supporting actors like grady sutton rags ragland carlos ramirez and pamela britton and an unlikely but impertubable jose iturbi as himself to keep one watching br br kelly is the star of the film although third billed and it is interesting to see him interact with children which astaire never did dean stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and latches on to the kelly character he also visit a school resulting in him telling the children a fictitious story of his life in the pomeranian navy which leads to his wonderful dance with an animated jerry mouse in another scene he dances a charming mexican hat dance with a sublimely grave faced little girl sharon mcmanus that is entrancing and sweet br br very pleasant then but a bit too long a taster of better musicals to come,1
platoon is to the vietnam war as rocky iv is to heavyweight championship boxing oliver stone's story of the experience of a us army platoon in vietnam in 1968 is so overdone it's laughable while most or all of the occurrences in platoon did occur over the 10 year span of us military involvement in vietnam to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame weeks gives a horribly skewed picture of the war in platoon the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two us soldiers murdering civilians us soldiers raping civilians a us sergeant murdering another us sergeant a us private murdering a us staff sergeant us soldiers killed wounded by friendly fire 90 killed or wounded in the platoon for stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a us soldier in vietnam is a disgrace two vietnam war films i would recommend are we were soldiers the true story of arguably the worst battle for us soldiers in vietnam and hbo's a bright shining lie,0
before watching this film i had very low expectations and went to just see the cars eventually i even regretted going for that reason plot is almost non existent character development is non existent so many clichés and so much jaw dropping cheesiness existed in the movie that i could only stare and wonder how it was even released if not for the exotics i wouldn't have even rated this movie a 1 an attempt at a coherent story line is destroyed by the sheer absurdity of this elite racing cult and the laughable characters that make up its members in fact the movie's plot is so predictable and simple minded that an average child could foretell the majority of the storyline bad acting bad plot bad jokes bad movie br br don't see it play gran turismo hd instead and it'll satiate your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste,0
the best of the seven sam fuller movies that i've seen including park row run of the arrow verboten shock corridor the naked kiss the big red one and this film pickup on south street counts as one of the best film noirs it represents fuller at his most controlled i like him when he's out of control of course but nearly everything in pickup is perfect the film is absolutely beautiful richard widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals some microfilm that was meant to go to communist spies jean peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend played by richard kiley peters is forced to find widmark and get it back she finds him through a stool pigeon played by thelma ritter widmark and peters are attracted to each other which changes peters loyalties that and the fact that she learns she's working for communists the cold war stuff is really interesting the love story is done a little quickly and not entirely believable but it's not so bad that it harms the film unlike fuller's previous film park row richard widmark is great this must be one of his best roles but i'm not so familiar with his career that i can say that for sure thelma ritter gives the most memorable performance her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance and her final scene in this film is as touching as any you will find in the cinema i will never forget that 10 10,1
anyone new to the incredibly prolific takashi miike's work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director in keeping with miike's working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with what takes the movie out of the realms of the same old same old however is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in today's cinema and this isn't that nice cool clean violence so beloved of us cinema this stuff is nasty painful and hurts that said the pace is breakneck the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities miike's sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be making it hard to look away from the screen whatever he might be showing you it doesn't have the ohmigod ending of dead or alive but if you're not squeamish now's the time to get on board the miike bandwagon before he ends up on some hollywood studio's new john woo shopping list,1
this movie was like a bad train wreck as horrible as it was you still had to continue to watch my boyfriend and i rented it and wasted two hours of our day now don't get me wrong the acting is good just the movie as a whole just enraged both of us there wasn't anything positive or good about this scenario after this movie i had to go rent something else that was a little lighter jennifer tilly is as usual a very dramatic actress her character seems manic and not all there darryl hannah though over played she does a wonderful job playing out the situation she is in more than once i found myself yelling at the tv telling her to fight back or to get violent all in all very violent movie not for the faint of heart,0
my super ex girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me i was really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable and you know what it was but this movie did have so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that anyone could get a kick out of i know that this was a very cheesy movie but uma and anna were just so cool and steve was such a great addition along with a great cast that looked like they had so much fun and that's what made the movie really work br br jenny johnson scary that's my best friend's actual name is not your typical average librarian looking woman when matt your average male asks her out he's in for more than he expected he's asked g girl out on a date the super hero of the world but when he finds out what a jealous and crazy girl she really is and decides that it may be a good idea that they spend some time apart but jenny won't have it since he's fallen for another girl hannah and she will make his life a living hell i mean let's face it he couldn't have chosen a better girl to break up with br br the effect were corny but you seriously move past them quickly the story and cast made the story really work and i loved uma in this movie it was such a step up from prime my super ex girlfriend is a fun movie that you shouldn't really take seriously it's just a cute romantic comedy that i think if i could get a laugh out of it anyone could br br 7 10,1
director sam fuller has something of a cult following particularly in europe yet the bulk of his films are more than forgettable he did however direct one really terrific movie in pickup on south street made pretty early on in his career the movies that followed were vastly inferior br br from the first to the last frame pickup works on all levels it's filmed with flawless fluidity boasting fine performances all round richard widmark and thelma ritter both players with a fine record of top notch performances are at their peak widmark who was no stranger at playing villains while truly mean to the core still manages to reveal just the slightest humanity which makes his character fascinating as well as making jean peters character's falling for him all the more credible br br fuller holds no punches in this genuinely tough movie there is a scene in which jean peters get roughed up by widmark it's truly shocking in its reality this is not a case of carefully choreographed photography br br less self conscious than many film noir's of the period this remains a great example of the genre,1
this is a story of two dogs and a cat looking for their way back home old and wise golden retriever shadow young american bulldog chance and himalayan cat sassy flee from the ranch and go into the wilderness to be reunited with their family homeward bound the incredible journey 1993 is a family adventure directed by duwayne dunham it's a remake of a 1963 film this movie got a sequel three years later michael j fox is the perfect man to do the voice over for chance fox has some youthful energy he brings to the role sally field does great voice work as sassy don ameche is fantastic as shadow this was this veteran actor's second last movie also the visible actors are great kim greist plays laura burnford seaver robert hays is bob seaver benji thall plays peter burnford veronica lauren is hope burnford kevin chevalia is jamie seaver jean smart portrays kate it's quite amazing to watch these pets trying to survive in the wilderness we see sassy taken by the river and she seems like a goner the bear scene is exiting and funny chance has no chance with that big hungry bear and his meeting with the porcupine looks painful this is some great fun for the whole family,1
when will people learn that some movies are made for fun and are not necessarily out to change the world if you realise this then expect to have heaps of fun while watching bill and ted's bogus journey this is a movie that is heaps of fun to watch keanu and alex make a great on screen team reprising their characters from bill and ted's excellent adventure with even more 'style' then they had in 1st movie it's not rocket science but it's great for a laugh the characters being extremely like able and the story line being so radical you have to laugh don't expect 'deep and meaningfulls' just expect pure fun,1
this film has the kernel of a really good story the work of the men and women of the coast guard especially in the north pacific is the stuff of heroes and legends this film mucks up a good story with three endings none satisfying a couple of unneeded and pointless bar fights and two alleged romantic relationships that have as much spark as dead campfire the rescue scenes are great even if the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal but the backstory is lame and disappointing costner is good especially his hand acting watch for it ashton kutcher is flat but not terrible the main female characters are one dimensional the best female is one of the coast guard sailors in the rescue center and she's on camera for about two minutes in the whole film it could have been an excellent film and costner needs one,0
'iedereen beroemd' has everything we can expect from a straight to video movie it's the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star the only thing he needs is to get her on stage surrounded by cameras and reporters a simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail the problem with the movie is not the basic plot but how it is made everything is supposed to be funny but it isn't it is trivial and clumsy the characters are shallow and the end sequence is totally without climax or emotion the last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing but only at how pathetic the whole set up is,0
for my opinion the middle of the film specially the love scene is a bit too long but the whole time you can imagine this desert feeling but the best what made this film unforgettable are the great explosion pictures their color slowmotion and the pink floyd music are unique in filmhistory br br destruction in its propper and popular form,1
can i give this a minus rating no well let me say that this is the most atrocious film i have ever tried to watch it was painful boringus maximus the plot is well hidden in several sub levels of nebulosity i rented this film with a friend and after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better we decided to fast forward a little to see if things would get any better it never gets better this film about some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls sounds interesting but in reality it is just a bore nothing even remotely interesting ever happens if you ever get the chance to watch this do yourself a favor try plan nine from outer space instead,0
this movie is one of the worst ones of the year the main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible paul rudd is the only one that has any talent and the only one that is not annoying i have never watched desparte housewives so i don't know how eva longoria is on that show but in this movie she was horrible it's like she knows nothing about acting all her character does is whine throughout the film and she can't pull off being a b and still be entertaining and the other girl lake bell displays little emotion and it's like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them br br as for the story it is so cookie cutter it goes from point a to b with little surprise so much more could have been used with kate as a ghost the plot should have revolved more around her and the things she does as a spirit br br final verdict it's not worth watching,0
i am a very big fan of jenna jameson but this movie is horrible at the time jenna jameson was married to brad armstrong and he was the director of this film and jenna was the hottest porn star ever so of course brad tried to make as much money as he could off her by making this big budget porn film now i know why they don't make big budget porn movies anymore in a fantasy world porn stars could act but this is the real world and they can't act that's why there porn stars if a women as beautiful as jenna could act then she would have tried to go into mainstream movies instead of porn just because your beautiful doesn't make you a movie star a fine example of this is traci lords when she was a teen thru her 20's she was one of the most beautiful sexy women on earth she made her move into low budget mainstream films and couldn't act where is she now i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because jenna is so hot but there are better movies she has made then dream quest come on jenna we don't want to hear you talk as much as we want to see you have sex also you jenna would have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you would have done anal on film,0
saw this movie at the rotterdam iff you may question some decisions of the maker like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject but this movie sure hits you in the gut especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch hope it gets the distribution it deserves,1
how did mike hammer live in a penthouse with a golf bag stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube tv and a snazzy fireplace nah he'd knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his fly specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown la flop house wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face that's how spillane wrote trash paperbacks for sure but how do you make it worse give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any film noir titled crap will sell at the box office add some over the hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw up the story line by some retard drugged out screen writer that's how,0
movie comedies nowadays are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor foul language and groin kicking modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator the undemanding and slow of brain sure an occasional good comedy will come along but they're becoming rarer all the time br br mr blandings buildings his dream house shows what 1940s hollywood was capable of and it's just screamingly funny jim and muriel blandings cary grant and myrna loy decide to build a house in the connecticut suburbs the film follows their story beginning with house hunting trips the house's riotous construction all the way to the finished home with its zuzz zuzz water softener br br grant and loy are perfect for their roles of course grant is particularly funny as he watches the house's costs zoom out of control however the film is stolen by the blandings' wise attorney played to perfection by melvyn douglas managing to steal every scene he's in douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the blandings lurch from crisis to crisis reginald denny as the blandings' harried architect and harry shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful br br i've watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh i think it's a good film to watch when you need a lift whether you're building a house or not,1
love it love it love it this is another absolutely superb performance from the divine miss m from the beginning to the end this is one big treat don't rent it buy it now,1
a very good wartime movie showing the effects of war on a hometown boy who looses his eyesight on guadalcanal and must come home and re adjust himself with the help of family and friends an excellent cast of actor's helps make this movie very entertaining eleanor parker's role as the girlfriend was worthy of an oscar nomination she has such an innocence to her in this movie ann doran role was equally satisfying as was all of her small supporting roles i especially like the hometown aura of pre war phildelphia the hunting scene is very good of course the war scene on guadalcanal truly showed the horror faced by our soldiers during this epic battle a well deserving film and one that should not be forgotten,1
i actually retired from asian horror films some time ago after becoming completely sick of seeing samey ghost story rubbish however i've been getting more and more into exploitation flicks recently and so decided to give them another chance my first port of call was highly rated director takashi miike's highly rated 'visitor q' i'd already seen audition and while i didn't like it much i do rate it as one of the better modern asian horror films so i went into this with sensible expectations and unfortunately found only boredom i suppose this movie is actually really clever and it just went over my head but what it seemed like to me was simply a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no coherency between them any comparisons to the work of luis bunuel and david lynch is blasphemous as far as i'm concerned all miike has done here is make a film any intelligence surrounding it has been implemented by pretentious fans desperate to find some kind of meaning my headache set in about 10 minutes in after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason and it didn't subside until the movie finally ended at least twenty four hours later or so it would seem don't get me wrong i'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around but while this may be violent it's also pointless and boring and i didn't get one ounce of enjoyment out of it takashi miike may have a lot of fans but i'm certainly not one of them and i certainly hope this is the last time i'll come into contact with one of his films,0
this whimsical film had the misfortune of being released at the same time of the highly popular amelie both having the wonderful audrey tautou playing the central role laurent firode the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of france in recent memory br br the film deals with chance as its english title indicates the french title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the atlantic as they fly as well as hurricanes in the pacific something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects from the start the director interlaces all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other something that is hard to imagine but in the film's context seems to work well br br a chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film irene who is going to work is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her zodiac sign is and proceeds to read from her paper irene it seems will cross paths and will find her soul mate that same day after irene leaves the train the quiet young man seated next to the woman tells her he has the same birth date as irene it seems they are destined to one another from the start but alas they will not reconnect until the last frame of the film br br audrey tautou is wonderful as irene faudel who plays younes doesn't have a lot to do until the end but he shows he has a presence and plays well his part the talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film which is as light as butterfly wings br br we look forward to future films by laurent firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected,1
i saw this gem of a film at cannes where it was part of the directors fortnight br br welcome to collinwood is nothing short of superb great fun throughout with all members of a strong cast acting their socks off it's a sometimes laugh out loud comedy about a petty crook cosimo played by luis guzman who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison while in prison he meets a lifer' who tells him of the ultimate bellini'  which to you and me  is a sure fire get rich quick scheme it turns out that there is a way through from a deserted building into the towns jewellers shop  which could net millions sounds simple  well throw in all kinds of wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have got the ingredients for a one wild ride  word passes from one low life loser to the next and soon a team of them are assembled to try and cash in on cosimos bellini' lead by failed boxer pero superbly played by sam rockwell  surely a star in the making and reluctant crook riley william h macy who is forced to bring his baby along with him as his wife was locked up for fraud br br based on the italian film i soliti ignoti big deal on madonna street which also inspired a similar film to collinwood'  palookaville' this knocks spots of the latter effort and although its written and directed by the russo brothers it definitely has shades of the coen brothers about it produced by steven soderbergh and george clooney who has a small yet hilarious part as a crippled safe breaker,1
i loved this movie i'm a mexican and was in the least offended by it in fact i think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over mexico it's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse it angers me to read in the news how killers kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells we should have someone like creasy denzel washington's character a bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante kidnapping is flourishing industry down here at least in the big cities i actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one's creasy did his fine job upon that would be so marvelous sorry i am that resentful man on fire is a gripping film that you can't miss it might be hard on some of you if you aren't used to reading subtitles mexicans do that all the time while watching american movies but the effort will be well worth it some of the editing is a bit fuzzy kind of like traffic remember another brilliant take on how corrupt mexico is the movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half i swear you'll be cheering as you watch denzel washington dispatch the wrong doers his performance is nothing short of excellent the ending no spoilers ok is a bit sad but i'm sure you'll like it anyway man on fire is one of the year's best movies a must own for a dvd collection 9 out of 10,1
i saw this movie when i was much younger and i thought it was funny i saw it again last week and you can guess the result some funny parts in it very few and too long the beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask me br br if you want a total b movie this is a good pick but don't expect too much from aliens dwarf size,0
the only thing great about the movie is its title in this case snake on a plane is example of not judging the book by its cover the title says nothing about the movie when i went to the theater i wasn't expecting citizen kane i was expecting independence day a movie that's pure popcorn fun but instead i got that horrible roy liotta movie called turbulence yes this is how bad soap is the only thing make soap better is its title and it's not even the apporiate title for the movie the wasn't even a glimpse of snake or plane 40 minutes into the movie what a false advertising if it wasn't for its title soap would be just another unforgettable cheap b grade summer movie and the r rating it has to be the most undeserved r rated movie of all time the makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a r all of the violence are kept pg 13 level you know what's really r rated the r rated superstar edge see him at summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake,0
i'm a big fan of nicolas cage and i never thought he would work on a movie like this i couldn't believe the other reviews and i thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once but trust me it is br br i haven't seen the old movie but why would they want to remake a movie like this the very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic this film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb i just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point but it never does br br so this movie is a big no no for both horror movie fans as well as for the cage fans you could probably for it show up on television,0
this film has so little class in comparison to strangers on a train or even accidental meeting for that matter that despite plot similarities i wouldn't feel right in actually comparing this to either of them the yancy butler character came across as such a dopey dimwit i was too embarrassed for the writer and director to continue watching br br i don't enjoy many lifetime movies but feel compelled to watch one every now and then in the interest of promoting harmony at home i often groan silently but this film caused me to protest out loud stand up leave the room and walk around the house mumbling to myself before i returned to my normally favorite chair to subject myself to more torture br br dean morgan rochester ny,0
actually one particular person character isn't right there but my summary line is referring to the power of the movie and this is all achieved without any fancy camera moves and or big production sets but with a great story and very believable and good actors conveying the story arc br br you could call it a companion piece to great japan movies cinema such as tokyo story etc not so much story wise of course but more mood wise great acting nuances in the performances that are truly gems if you're eager to experience a touching story and want to see a movie touching you emotionally than this is the one to go as you have noticed as with many of my reviews i'm not getting into the story there are places here at imdb where you can look those up i'm not one to spoiler the story whatsoever,1
forget the jaded comments that come before these this is an action packed but sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting well acted even by elizabeth berkley recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change,1
this movie was way over hyped a lot of the viewers who thought this was amazing must have been into the old school movies cause the whole movie is set in the past at first i thought the movie was just showing something from the past so i was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass but it just going basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past and the 2 don't mix very well in this movie even with special effects you could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with there are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying it's the greatest movie ever done it's just crap on a stick it also didn't help that the story line was sooo crappy i don't understand why hollywood agreed to have this movie produced and i also don't understand how actors actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this it's almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print it will all be done on a computer this was a movie that should have been on a movie network because nothing about this movie was revolutionary i'm very upset with myself for paying money to see this whatever you do don't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow,0
this is the second film i've seen of ida lupino as a director after 53's the hitch hiker i think this one was a better film then that one this one has a girl who is about to get married and she is then sexually assaulted and doesn't like everyone looking and talking about her so she runs away and and is taken in by a family i think leonard maltin's review is right only to give it 2 and 1 2 stars,1
at a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious on first viewing i'm kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with 'shaun of the dead' now given i view simon pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius i realise this is a rather big claim and to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'fido' will appeal to you br br in a way the comedy picks up where 'shaun' left off except we're back in the original 1950s living dead era stereotypical middle american small town the zombie wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well adjusted useful members of the community this so we're informed at the outset is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at zomcom a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps br br the beauty of the film lies in its dead pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose the charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through the veneer of good clean living keeping up appearances repressed emotion muddled parental values social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual br br it's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film's all round strong cast it's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part it's also fun imagining what billy connelly learning his script must have been like br br so in conclusion it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you,1
i loved this movie it is a definite inspirational movie it fills you with pride this movie is worth the rental or worth buying it should be in everyones home best movie i have seen in a long time it will make you mad because everyone is so mean to carl brashear but in the end it gets better it is a story of romance drama action and plenty of funny lines to keep you tuned in i love a lot of the quotes i use them all the time they help keep me on task of what i want to do it shows that anyone can achieve their dreams all they have to do is work for it it is a long movie but every time i watch it i never notice that it is as long as it is i get so engrossed in it that it goes so quick i love this movie i watch it whenever i can,1
this movie was strange i watched it while ingesting a quarter of psilcybe cubensis mushrooms it was really weird im pretty sure you are supposed to watch it high but mushrooms weren't enough i couldn't stop laughing maybe lsd would work the movie is a bunch of things morphing into other things and dancing its really cheesy for todays standards but when it was released im sure it was well one of a kind i could see how some people would think this movie was good but i didn't think it was very interesting and i was on mushrooms at the time if your having a party or something and everybodys pretty lit pop it on you'll get a few laughs,0
i hate over long over talky french movies but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest french movie of them all i saw it twice in the mid 70's and then it disappeared but i finally got to see it again in 1999 and fell in love all over again what is most remarkable is that it feels every bit as fresh today as it did 25 years ago if you haven't seen it don't miss your chance,1

i am decidedly not in the target audience for this film i am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film this happened quite by accident with the discovery of a movie called clerks late one night on television the first two things i noticed about that film were that it was 1 technically amateurish and 2 brilliantly written when i read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was clerks i started to get interesting when he said his main influence was the station agent a movie i'd seen on dvd a week prior i decided i had to go and check it out the result could be described along the same lines as clerks although the two films are nothing alike content wise both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing whereas clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation less like me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy he's always running one way or another filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones the themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant i can tell from watching it that not much has changed since i was growing up young men still have the same problems they always have the writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular crafts wonderfully honest characters and has them do completely believable things as far as indie cinema goes this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint but from an artistic one it is very close,1
i'm a male not given to women's movies but this is really a well done special story i have no personal love for jane fonda as a person but she does one hell of a fine job while deniro is his usual superb self everything is so well done acting directing visuals settings photography casting if you can enjoy a story of real people and real love this is a winner,1
i picked this film up based on the plot summary and critics' quotes on the back of the box i'm not big into foreign films and didn't know what to expect i don't really care for subtitles either but i absolutely loved it it has a simple lovable quality that leaves you feeling good about life i found myself laughing out loud repeatedly i'd recommend this picture to anyone even those who abhor foreign films with subtitles this one makes it worth the effort,1
this is one of the most amazing stories i have ever seen br br if this film had been directed by larry clark then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first place br br instead the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting and how it effected the victims who survived br br i had seen busy phillips in other films before but her performance in this movie is by far her best the only other movie that i've seen with erika christensen is swim fan which made me almost not want to watch this film but she turned in a very good performance herself br br this is one of the few movies i have seen that was actually able to make me cry trust me when i tell you that doesn't happen very often br br home room is a beautiful film and that's all there is too it,1
why why did they make this movie if timothy olyphant wasn't shirtless in it several times there would be absolutely no reason to watch this movie ever um plot nope well defined characters nope the only time i laughed was when my boyfriend made fun of the whole she bang p s andy dick nope,0
if i had just seen the pilot of this show i would have rated it a 10 i was immediately hooked on this gorgeous new world subsequent episodes have not completely lived up to the promise but i will keep watching and hope that it keeps getting better the production values are incredible and the acting is first rate i don't mind that it doesn't seem to align perfectly with bsg because i am so intrigued by the premise and let's face it they are two different shows i'm thrilled that both esai morales and one of my all time faves eric stoltz are back in my life if only weekly as i've missed them both this is a show that requires a bit of thought from its audience and that is always a good thing you kind of have to wrap your head around certain aspects of the show things are not always as they seem and certainly there are shades of gray both literally and figuratively in plot lines characters and of course the various virtual worlds we all know how it ends but the journey is looking to be quite a ride,1
the french naudet brothers did something nobody else did they had a video camera the day that this tragedy happened they were in building 2 when you could see papers drifting down people hitting the ground from jumping from such a height br br i mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapsed they went running their camera was still running when the white dust covered them they found a shop doorway and got inside but all this footage is real and i think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for us br br ten stars goes to the naudet brothers that filmed this extraordinary film that i watch every 9 11 so i'll never forget what this country went through i believe if i remember right it shows the first death of the priest of the firefighters while he was being carried to the church and his honorable funeral,1
this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection 'comics underground japan' and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this as it explains some of the plot of the movie which is otherwise inexplicable animation wise this is pretty decent good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well it jumps in and out of episodes as the characters a cat and his brain dead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images a boat a circus a desert for a mere half hour they go through a number of semi plots and settings which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the long running manga to adapt at random but primarilly selected visually knowing what's going on might somewhat increase appreciation this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show cartoon sushi in particular a short that features a cat chasing a man's severed butt cheek around the house only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes though not all that easy to tell what's going on the dvd of this has director's commentary and a making of features but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them i'm giving this a 8 10 for now here isnt much to compare it to in anime and i hope for more like this,1
watched this with my girlfriend after stumbling over it while zaping channels br br i guess we both hoped for some kind of happy family cute christmas movie but were extremely disappointed br br the actor playing the soldier seems to have 0 emotion whatsoever his face looks the same whether he's chopping down christmas tree's seeing the girl he loves being kissed by her boyfriend or when he's happily surprised by the girl he loves he's an awful actor and at no pont did any of us do nothing but laugh at him br br then there's the cute blond girl blessed with the ability to count dot's and cheat on her boyfriend what a catch and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more dots br br so it's basically a story about a guy without any emotion or feelings who falls for a guy who count dots and cheats on her boyfriend it's as predictable as it get's and really a waste of time you gain nothing by watching this other than some weird laughs because it's all so corny br br i love it when her dad says that he only eats french fries and not french wine and they all laugh that's the hillbilly attitude this movie is about furthermore if my girlfriends dad were bossing me around like i'd tell him a thing or to but not our army veteran no sir he let's everyone boss him around br br the movie is what first blood would have been if john rambo were burn like the biggest wimp in the world,0
jeez only in the 70's antonio margheriti brings us this quirky hybrid of spaghetti western and kung fu flick evolving around a treasure hunt the spices of this trashy co production between shaw brothers and an italian one off company include humorous storytelling off the wall happenings and some very tame t a extra campy moments are being served by lee van cleef's obnoxious wig leather clad bible thumping psycho gunman yancey hobbitt loveably hammed up by julian ugarte the man who should've done way more obscure european genre productions than he did wanna be witty dialogue hilarious background music and completely laughable sound effects accompanying various little events especially every jump made by lo lieh br br while this little piece of action falls fare and square into the turkey territory it's great to see van cleef and lo lieh on the same screen and you can't deny the charisma of this duo don't expect too much and you'll get plenty out of it br br this is my truth what is yours,0
i'll admit that i don't expect much from a roger corman film generally i expect a lot of walking and bad scripts yet in this case i am pleasantly surprised br br the gunslinger is a story of a woman played by the spunky beverly garland who takes over as sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered ms garland is a pretty good shot herself killing one of the murderers the next day at her husband's funeral her first task is to shut down the local bar that is violating the town curfew the bar's owner is trying to buy land in anticipation of being bought out by the hoped for railroad however ms garland is a thorn in her plans and the bar matron hires a man to kill ms garland br br because of ms garland's plays her role honestly and realistically there is absolutely no temptation to go to suzanne somers she's the sheriff jokes with the exception of a couple of faux pas the apartment door that opens out from the inside jeep tracks and the two horsemen waiting on screen for their cue to ride around a corner the movie becomes quite passable as movie fare however corman could not resist padding his film with horse riding scenes much like he does walking in other films br br sterno says the gunslinger is a horse opera worth your time,0
all i could think of while watching this movie was b grade slop many have spoken about it's redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events yet really the techniques used as many have already mentioned were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole br br as far as the plot is concerned it was lacklustre unimaginative implausible and convoluted you can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as i would br br granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action looks can only carry a film so far the action is poor and intermittent a few punches thrown here and there and a final gunfight towards the end nothing really to write home about br br as others have said 'bad' movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are 'bad' you revel in that fact this film however is a void it's nothing br br furthermore if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then i would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way 'requiem for a dream' 'trainspotting' 'fear and loathing in las vegas' and 'candy' are just a few examples though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like 'go' overall both serious and funny and 'halfbaked' br br on a final note the one possibly redeeming line in this movie delivered by vinnie jones was stolen from 'lock stock and two smokling barrels' to think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by 'loaded' is vile br br overall i strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by not seeing this movie,0

this movie in away was super clever it's theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made valentine makes zero attempt to be original what is valentine anyway it's a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier there is nothing original in valentine br br i only saw it once and in that one viewing here are some of the films it ripped off 1 prom night 2 carrie 3 scream 4 any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody br br i know there is more but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk so it couldn't grab them as fast as they came br br valentine had no chance of being a good movie how come every horror movie has to have a suprise killer people you don't care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene one minute a nice girl turns into an evil b ch then she's an insecure woman and so on and son on br br normally any horror movie in my book can be saved by gore once again valentine doesn't have this it was as if they tried to make it pg 13 but failed so they left the edit br br do not see this overly inspired rip off unless you hate yourself and you want to die br br 1 2 3 j leonard rollins,0

a great suspense movie with terrific slow camera work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy director writer brian de palma does a super hitchcock imitation many called it a ripoff with this film and the 2 35 1 widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camera work and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted for tv tapes br br the downside of the movie at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard is the general sleaziness of all the characters including the policeman played by a pre nypd dennis franz who has hair here br br the opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson that is quite explicit even 25 years after its release the film has several erotic scenes in it as dickinson if that is really her on the closeups and nancy allen are not shy about showing their bodies br br there is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until franz enters the picture after the murder the first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it's apparent who the killer is it's still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through particularly for males ogling the naked women,1
i just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable it is a quiet little film that doesn't overwhelm you with special effects or big performances it simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of north carolina br br henry thomas gives a good performance as raymond toker a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods toker's search for the baby's parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life david srathairn plays truman lester a slimy conman with an ulterior motive and david plays the bad guy to perfection br br there is much more to this film than first meets the eye filmed on location in north carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music it is worth watching,1
this is a very strange film by director animator richard williams all who know of william's work know it's a bit off kilter if not ingenious but this one takes the cake br br it features two hapless ragdolls who have to save their owner's new french doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way the strength in this movie lies primarily in its aesthetic quality its strange character designs its powerful animation and its stark contrast of the sweet and scary williams' brilliant animation portrayed raggedy ann and andy as real rag dolls floppy and darned rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls which made it more believable at least in a visual sense the animation shines on the bring us the camel with the wrinkled knees whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end the silent movie chase with sir leonard looney and of course the greedy br br the greedy animation on its own is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation i've ever seen there's something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop and every second it's something new living in what was deemed the taffy pit the greedy is a massive blob man that lives in and mercilessly eats sweets he sings a song that i can't help but feel hold some sexual undertones then tries to kill raggedy ann for her candy heart br br the only complaint i have about this film is that there are too many songs it continuously bogs down the movie's pace because there are sixteen of them there are about six good songs which should have been the only ones including i look and what do i see no girl's toy blue though they didn't need to make him sing it twice i never get enough because i love you and maybe i'm home the others just seem unnecessary and frankly aren't too amazing to listen to br br this is a weird film with strange undertones but if that's what you're looking for you won't find better,1
i know that actors and actresses like to try different kinds of movies hey no one wants to get typecast but danny glover brenda fricker happy birthday brenda and christopher lloyd should have known better than this angels in the outfield is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes and saves the day do i even need to tell you how it ends the movie is just plain lowly escapism examples of high escapism are the various sci fi movies from the '50s if these movies had some political undertone or at least offered us a new look at life then they would be ok this one is just pointless far closer to diabolical than angelic also starring tony danza adrien brody and matthew mcconaughey and i suspect that they don't wish to stress this in their resumes,0
this film is underrated i loved it it was truly sweet and heartfelt a family who struggles but isn't made into a dysfunctional family which is so typical of films today the film didn't make it an issue that they have little money or are dominican republican the way hollywood have br br instead the issue is victor is immature and needs to grow up he does slowly by the film's end he has a ways to go but it was a heartfelt attempt to move forward his grandmother is very cute and the scene where the little boy throws up had me laughing for the longest time a truly heartfelt indie,1
mild spoilers br br in the near future arnold stars as ben richards a wrongly convicted man coerced into playing 'the running man' a deadly tv game show where people have to keep moving to try and escape brutal deaths at the hands of the 'stalkers' of course people are expected to die eventually and its up to arnold to prove the system wrong br br i haven't read the stephen king book but this is a great film regardless one of arnold's best he does what he does best in the action man role delivering death with unforgettable one liners classics are probably the 'he was a real pain in the neck' after strangling a guy with barb wire and 'he had to split ' referring to whereabouts he just chain sawed someone vertically dawson is perfectly irritating as the tv presenter and all the 'stalkers' are suitably camp the action is violent but its an action film that's the point the film is fast paced and at 90 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome br br with starsky and hutch's paul michael glaser at the helm and made in the wake of the success of the terminator previously this film was probably seen as just another mindless action vehicle for arnold and very far fetched but today anyone who watches a lot of tv could see how the film is getting closer to reality i wouldn't be surprised if i turn on the tv in the 'near future' and see a show not to far from this br br on that depressing note i must however recommend 'the running man' to anyone who likes the 80s arnold ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action film 9 5 10,1
once you can get past the film's title pecker is a great film perhaps one of john waters' best a wonderful cast headed by strong performances by edward furlong and christina ricci make the story very funny and very real there are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for young children but they are there for a purpose unfortunately this movie was not mass produced and most of the public will be denied the opportunity to view it if the opportunity knocks then go see this film,1

there is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the tiniest scrap of talent nobody in it has ever tried acting before even the extras in the coffee shop look as if they've been glued in place nothing looks rehearsed the film quality is terrible most of the 'action' takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman crammed in as an afterthought swinging some cheapo camera backwards and forwards between 'actors' as they deliver their lines no tripod and no proper microphone either there sound quality is terrible even 'manos' fares better than this at least they had proper equipment what plot there is simply gets lost in the production mess br br stick to home videos preferably made by some 5 year kid trying out the video feature on daddy's new camera phone you will be in for a long search to find a movie more inept than this,0
this movie is a bad to alright rip off of friday the 13th the movie is about a killer named bernie who kills people around a camp councilor training camp he kills people because the camp councilor training camp is on land that was owned by his father and when the police came to forcefully take his fathers land they accidentally killed his mother another f13th take off the intro is seeing bernie killing his first victims then we are introduced to a family going camping in the same woods soon after they arrive they are joined by a strange old man who likes talking about his son later we learn that his son is bernie and that he has him locked up in the back of his caravan after having broken him out of a mental institute he sets bernie after the family so they can take their stuff and then the chase is on br br this movie is only recommended to those who enjoy b grade 80's slashers,0
yeah i saw the rough cuts the unedited sex scenes the dire cut scenes almost on a par with the film 'the need' for awful acting this movie is as bad as bad films get the bad script bad acting bad effects bad locations bad stunts bad everything the best 'actors' in the film were the lap dancers they hired for the vampire extras br br sean harry the 'foppish actor' as someone else put it makes a matchstick look talented here his amazing ability to badly drive a car when it is obviously being shook by people on the bonnet check out the reflection in the windscreen his inability to turn left which is class oh and don't forget the sex scene plus his noteworthy use of a toy gun which the props guys couldn't even be bothered to disguise as a real gun the other actors on screen could barely deliver their lines it was as if half the time they were waiting for a line that wasn't there br br the 'special effects' were soooo good to the point that the guys who did it took their real names off the credits br br if you want a laugh at a party then rent this movie then again there are plenty of good comedies that are just as funny and don't give money to people who don't deserve it,0

i claim no matter how hard i seek i'll never find a better movie version of othello if you love kenneth branagh's magnificent masterpieces much ado about nothing 1993 and hamlet 1996 as much as i do i'm dead certain you'll also find oliver parker's othello irresistible laurence fishburne has been in a various splendid roles during his career he was quite terrific in boys n the hood 1991 i've always considered his amusing role of furious styles as his very greatest achievement that was of course way before i saw this br br he plays the part of othello and he is probably in the most challenging role of his whole career but he does a brilliant fantastic job irène jacob is absolutely charming desdemona and kenneth branagh is just simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role of the story's crooked manipulate villain iago marvelous othello is part of the absolute elite among shakespeare's ingenious works it deals with his favorite topics crookedness envy deceitfulness and jealousy this movie adaptation is certainly one of the finest films i've seen that's based on william shakespeare's plays,1
this movie was a disappointment i was looking forward to seeing a good movie i am the type of person who starts a movie and doesn't turn it off until the end but i was forcing myself not to turn it off br br theonly reason why i didn't turn it off was because i am a huge christian slater fan and i wanted to see him act in it i was really speechless after i finished watching the movie br br this movie was one of the worst movies that i have seen in my life thank you christian slater for putting some humor into it if you hadn't been in this movie i would of been bored out of my mind br br i also agree that anthony hopkins needs to stick to acting by the time the movie was over i didn't even get the plot i was both confused and annoyed,0
i simply give this a three because it fulfilled what my buddies and i hoped it would do entertain br br i wasn't stupid enough to rent this thinking it would be a zombie film up there with the likes of romero or fulci but what i rented it for was a laugh br br if you are looking for a film for amusement or a film to make you shake your head in embarrassment go for it this is perfect for junior mystery science theater fans but the only downside is that it is so bad it makes fun of itself br br i personally think it is a shame to relate this to any other hollywood title that we may know because when a film sucks like this it has its own genre,0
i rented this film about a month ago when i had nothing else to do on a friday night all i can say to describe this worthless film is 'trash' the acting is so badly done i've seen kids in high school do a better job the whole cast seems like they're just reading their lines out no feeling no emotion and no room to capture the viewer on another note the special effects were insanely cheesy and the whole thing looked like it had been shot with a camera anyone can buy a radio shack br br the clown himself looks nothing like the one on the video cover heck he doesn't even show up in the film until near the end and all he does it hum songs and go around stalking a few characters there is no real murder shown either so this isn't a real slasher film either since i've seen it i've questioned a few things 1 if is 'serial insane clown killer' wouldn't that be a serial killer who kills clowns 2 if your friend goes missing why would you go out into the woods to have sex rather than look for her sad really br br 3 why is it that the only real acting sputtered vainly out at the end all of a sudden did the cast finally decide to show effort in their jobs this film is as sad as they come my advice is to avoid renting it lest you waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming,0
very interesting and moving documentary about the world trade center tragedy on 11th september 2001 the main theme of it is the heroism of american fire fighters who tried to rescue as many people as they could the film is deeply emotional and rather disturbing many people seen on screen have lost their lives recommended,1
every time i watch this movie i am more impressed by the whole production i have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made everyone involved is perfect script acting direction sets and editing whilst james stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance and the supporting cast are magnificent it is margaret sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was her tragic personal life give poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take breathtaking,1
if this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic it might i say might have been a hit have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its faults well this is it every one of the acting cast should be nominated for worst acting performance awards it would be hard to find another film with this kind of production budget that contains so little of any value whatsoever the whole thing from the opening scenes defies logic dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical ditto for the behaviour and general storyline of the film itself what is really mind boggling is that some buffoons in a boardroom actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of trash wow,0
since i first saw anchors aweigh in 1945 viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me at age 15 it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great mgm technicolor musicals now i am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players though sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after his emergence after his dorsey days as a solo singer this was his first major film appearance as another viewer noted this seems almost to be a warm up for on the town sinatra may have had to work hard at it but his dance with kelly is credible and he would do better in their next pairings however observing his physique it's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat though gene kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film his winsome performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force almost the iconic figure for mgm musicals where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of fred astaire finally it was strange to see the fresh faced dean stockwell and remember that he would later play a thrill killer in compulsion based on the leopold loeb murder from the 1920s an additional note one reviewer praised the performance of betty garrett as sinatra's love interest she later played opposite him in on the town but pamela britton was featured in this film,1
smallville episode justice is the best episode of smallville it's my favorite episode of smallville,1
you can do a lot with a little cash blair witch proved that this film supports it it is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity however because it has john cleese as sherlock holmes it manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldn't afford a shoestring the highlight of this film is arthur lowe as the sincere bumbling watson his dimness and slowness foils cleese's quick tempered wit if you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two,1
skip mission galactica and watch the original living legend episodes instead the network took parts 1 2 of living legend and jammed them into one plot with the awful fire in space episode although galactica suffered from network controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production living legend is the best of the 1978 tv series fire in space on its own is one of the worst episodes as a historical note watch galactica the original star trek and then the revival trek series and you'll see the difference in quality between network produced sci fi and syndicated sci fi,0
the russian movie 4 follows the lives of three not four strangers who meet one night in a local bar one is a musician one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl br br 4 i gather is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post soviet russia the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes operating secret cloning facilities selling decades old frozen meat etc but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybody's really up to here br br despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes 4 is a two hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs,0
after the usual chase scene jerry accidentally winds up inside a bottle of invisible ink which was part of a chemistry set he quickly discovers he's invisible so the predictable results occur meaning he uses his new hidden condition to torment tom jerry often is just defending himself but often he has sadistic streak in him that torments the cat whenever possible even when unprovoked br br here he makes tom think his eyes are deceiving him when cheese from a mousetrap disappears before his eyes or milk from a dish tom can't take anymore so he tries to sleep this nightmare off but jerry sets fire to his paw man i hope little kids didn't ideas watching these cartoons back in the '40s and '50s i always found jerry the little mouse more evil than cute br br thankfully in cartoons generally whatever damage a character suffers is gone within seconds and he's back to normal br br the best part of this cartoon is about two thirds of the way through when tom figures out what the story is with jerry and tries different methods to detect where the mouse is located such as putting flour on the floor to see his footprints,1
the coming attractions to the order make it seem like a decent horror mystery thriller but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage br br first off the whole movie consists of terrible dialogue and god awful special affects the acting was also nothing to be proud of but keath ledger i think i spelled that right saved the movie in this category br br for heaven's sake don't see this movie,0
i have walked out of very few movies before they end but i couldn't finish this piece of garbage this was the biggest load of racism trying to pass as legitimate film since birth of a nation the characters were little more than cardboard cutouts i don't see how any actor would want their name associated with this film lee must have better things to do that put out garbage like this i know that i and anyone with a brain have better things to do like watching paint dry i wish that someone would make a film about interracial relationships that dealt with the topic realistically there is a lot more depth to this subject the shallow ranting of a bitter director like lee,0
i could see this film is super he didn't surprise to oneself when so that it was taking place for the truth this way by itself how swigged flight to the which didn't have the place but it is only such an conspiratorial theory right br br very i liked watching this film when i was the child i am interesting which so that it was if it turned out that such a flight was taking place really certainly to it for not a belief because it is denying logic and the common sense who at healthy senses sent to kids with space shuttle into the orbit i very like reading for the subject american and soviet space programs i know a few missions of space shuttles remained provided by cia with the clause top secret certainly these are only such my divagations but who knows,1
this is supposed to be well researched and based on fact how come therefore that it's so packed with mcgovernisms did the people of derry live in some kind of bizarre philip k dick world in which reality was uncannily like cracker liam priest or is mcgovern an idle hack who just keeps repeating hims,0
return of the jedi is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right and that is a shame because the last chronological installment in the star wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling it manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale and does so very convincingly br br yes there are ewoks cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the star wars demographic and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit but the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga where luke finally comes face to face with darth vader the most recognizable villain in movie history br br return of the jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook it presented an incredible conclusion to the darth vader storyline which went from slightly implausible in the empire strikes back to very convincing here an exciting opening at jabba's palace a masterful performance of ian mcdiarmid as the emperor luke finally coming into his own the resolution of solo and leia's romance and the extremely powerful final moments on the endor moon br br yes there are slight annoyances but they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to nitpick every single scene it's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter it's not a 'good' movie it's fantastic,1
we've all seen this story a hundred times you can see each plot turn coming a mile away the relationship between the mother and daughter is way too sweet and understanding to pass for realistic janet mcteer's performance is stock southern hot ticket mother in vintage clothes should have been made for the lifetime channel,0
note to horror fans the only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so worthless it's insulting br br i watched this because br br the premise sounded slightly promising it's not it's just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low budget slasher films that weren't good either br br the promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful it's not it's so not the amateur cinematography makes sure the fallen angels are about as sexy as the average homeless person br br the name tom savini has a long history in the horror genre he's the king of low budget special effects and lower budget acting come to think of it savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie it's not that he's bad but he's almost always in bad movies his only good role was in from dusk till dawn and he's been milking that at horror conventions ever since br br but let's focus on the positive forest of the damned is a great example of how not to make a movie br br everything else is a negative obviously the writer is allergic to originality the script is terrible that's all a given after the first 10 minutes but the clueless pacing the way the director treats plot and characterization as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway and the excruciatingly long and boring driving walking and nature sequences no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general br br this is another good example of the number one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad if it's written and directed by the same person expect garbage,0
well this might be one of the funniest movies of all time and sandy gives a tour de force performance alas her career never quite took off but at last she will always be remembered for her three first rate pictures the king of comedy dallas doll and without you i'm nothing she dons into different personas from new york socialite to diana ross to create a biting and hilarious critique of popular culture in america sexy and fierce tender and sensual philosophical and melancholic she convinces the audience in every scene and she actually is really pretty watch this one if you're not from iowa you'll certainly enjoy it,1
perhaps the last film you would expect to come from vittorio de sica and cesare zavattini who wrote the novel on which this film is based it's a neorealist fantasy kind of an oxymoron really an old woman finds a baby in her cabbage patch and raises him as her own son after a few years the baby is a young boy named toto and the adoptive mother is dying he goes to an orphanage and when he finally turns 18 he leaves immediately he finds that he has no home toto is optimistic though and won't let anything get him down a man steals his valise and instead of getting angry over it toto becomes his friend and goes and stays with him in a small shantytown toto takes some initiative and organizes the many homeless living in the area and they build a better shantytown soon the landowner is trying to sell this plot of land and the citizens of the shantytown have to protect themselves after many attempts the owner mounts a force of police to get rid of the homeless at this point the film becomes full fledged fantasy before this it was more comedic fantastic melodrama in the style of charlie chaplin this stuff is so weird and shocking that it's probably best for others to see it for themselves it's quite amazing and very funny there are objections you could raise about the plot of miracle in milan most certainly fellini and visconti were greatly criticized when they started to stray from neorealism i think i read this was widely criticized at the time of its release at this point though it's so enjoyable i loved it very much it might be my favorite of vittorio de sica's films although umberto d and the bicycle thieves come very very close 10 10,1
i disliked this movie for numerous reasons within the first ten minutes of the film i grew extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to salvage itself for me at least that it was going to have to pull itself out of the enormous hole it had dug unfortunately that did not occur the two draws of the movie for me were to see jane fonda and felicity huffman i don't know enough about lindsey lohan's work to have been interested in what she would bring to the film afterward i just felt disappointed in and for all three of them even though there were moments in each of their performances i imagine that for each of them to find their moments was a very difficult task given the fact that there was an amazing lack of character development and uninspired dialog although the plot is an interesting one the movie on the whole is so poorly written directed and edited that anybody's performance as an actor would suffer and be tainted by it the disrespectful way in which it dealt with sexual abuse and the trite and insulting viewpoint of small town america i think were the two main reasons why this film failed in hitting it's mark as one reviewer has noted and i would agree the movie is almost impossible to market given it's finished form i suspect that or at least hope that for the actor's sakes anyway there are some real gems on the cutting room floor sad for us but if that's true then the actors can take solace in that and feel somewhat good about lending their talents and time to such a flop oh yeah and another thing i wished for just once i could go see an american movie which included the sadly disappearing but wonderfully bucolic settings such as the one in this film where the main characters weren't absentmindedly and or disrespectfully littering the country side with pop cans smashed cds and other such trash,0
holy crap this is so hysterical why aren't american comedies written like this for anybody who thinks comedy has to be dumb there is more wit and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than in a shelf of novels hugh laurie is a complete hoot i couldn't believe it was the same guy as house there are so many great lines and gags in this series you could watch each show dozens of times and still pick up on new things each time rowan atkinson is hilarious as the verbose and put upon butler edmund this is my favorite of all the blackadder series and tony robinson is wonderful as ever as the somewhat obtuse heart of the series the oppressed mass baldrick some of my favorite lines when someone messes with a wellington he really puts his foot in it and baldrick explaining how he got his name and cousin macadder the top kipper salesman and homicidal swordsman from scotland,1
this is just a terrible 'comedy' it really is a bad film there are no funny elements no jokes that are funny i don't know how some people can claim this dismal short film could be 'smartest' or 'quality ' perhaps if its the only film that a person has seen you can make that claim of the brothers but i have seen thousands of better films namely leonard part six now that's funny i don't know how the brothers is even considered eligible to be listed on the internet movie database its more like a home video than an actual film br br jokes aside just skip this film a root canal is more enjoyable that this cliche ridden unfunny material,0
one of my favourite films first saw it when i was about 10 which probably tells you a lot about the type of humour although dated the humour definitely has a charm about it expect to see the usual askey murdoch banter so popular in its day with lots of interesting quirky co characters the lady with the parrot the couple due to get married and are in trouble from 'her' and my favourite the stationmaster nobody knows where it comes from nobody knows where it goes interestingly the ghost train was written by arnold ridley of dads army fame private godfrey the medic watch it on a rainy sunday afternoon after your lunch and smile,1
this is a weak sequel it lacks the interest and light touch of the magnificent man called horse in nearly every aspect and when compared to each other they hardly seem to be the same genre br br the return is almost a parody of the first and tries to evoke different indian ceremonies but comes across as trying way too hard to bottle the magic of the first in this film the tribe is lost and abandoned having lost their homelands modern life has encroached on paradise and they are living in abject misery and poverty perhaps this is the point the first film took us to a place where we would want to be a simpler time this takes us to broken indians in a miserable world and the white man is the hero and savior which rather negates the whole idea of the film br br the beauty of the first lay in the fact that the white man learnt and discovered that real civilization lies in values rather than western materialism in the second film this is all but lacking and so we end up with a weak film br br a huge disappointment,0
this documentary now available free on video google com is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice everyone must see this br br chavez was elected in a landslide vote in 1998 his platform was to divert the fantastic oil wealth from the 20 middle class to the 80 poor he banned foreign drift net fishing in venezuelan waters he sent 10 000 cuban doctors to the slums to treat the sick for free he wiped out illiteracy and set up new free universities br br but it was his 30 tax on oil company profits that got him in trouble with the bush administration in 2002 while irish film makers kim bartley and donnacha o'briain were interviewing chavez inside the presidential palace about his social programs a cia backed coup was launched with the cameras rolling chavez was captured and flown out of the country it was announced on national tv that he had 'resigned' br br but the poor of venezuela didn't believe the media they went to the palace in their millions and demanded that chavez be returned in the face of such overwhelming numbers the military turned on the coup leaders and the plotters fled to the us chavez was rescued by military helicopter and returned to jubilation,1
it does come out of left field and really isn't what you're expecting but i love that the most memorable movie experiences come from being surprised if you ask me if you haven't been tipped off about the mysterious thing that makes these brothers so odd you're in for a treat br br the cast is fantastic but not stretching so much that it's palpable the special effects come out of nowhere seriously it's like an oddly dark romantic comedy until they do then wow and they're great the overall cinematography is easy on the eyes the editing and sound are very good quality and the twisted story unfolds without clichés while none of these aspects individually make it a blockbuster the what the hell factor alone makes it a film treasure br br the people who bash this movie make no sense it's one of those often overlooked flicks of the 90's that you've either never heard of or love so much you jump at the mention of its title br br i'm in the latter group,1
ghost story the tv movie 1972 was the pilot for the nbc series the movie was well written and well acted and i thought when the 1972 73 tv season started if the tv series is half as good as the movie then nbc has a winner i wish this film was available on video the series was a colossal disappointment even with william castle as exec producer if however you have a chance to see the original tv movie ghost story check it out you won't be disappointed,1
i was kinda interested in this movie as a trashy cannibal flick i was thoroughly disappointed it was the same kind of disappointment i felt watching 'friday the 13th jason takes manhattan' so much potential wasted br br the opening scene is a decent attention grabber then it grinds to a halt copious breasts and egregious 80s fashion cannot help this movie the only things eating near this island of cannibal monks are the piranha i'm not asking for 'cannibal holocaust' level of gore but i was looking for cheap over the top exploitative gore i got none of that br br i found a couple parts of the fight scenes somewhat intriguing hence the 2 stars i don't think its really worth the time it takes to watch it though i could see showing it at a party where nobody cares about what is going on and you just want something on in the background but i would not tell anyone oh dude you gotta see this movie it is neither good enough nor bad enough to warrant much attention,0
this movie was extremely boring it should least not more than 15 minutes the images of child and animal being killed were little bit disturbing br br usually i don't write comments but this one was so bad having so many good and excellent comments i think in this case we are one step closer to honest assessment of this title br br what more can i say i fall asleep during this movie 3 times it was about 4 hours after i had woken up from 8 hours long sleeping period i think it is the point itself br br there is no dialog between characters except maybe 2 sentences at the very end br br when you fall asleep once watching it do not try to rewind and catch up because you will fall asleep again,0
wow what a whirlwind the 30's is a decade with plenty of movies of every type i can imagine especially during the early talkies phase there were movies which are painfully static and dull like dracula with bella lugosi and there were those that just don't give it a rest sometimes in a good way and other times not this is one of the films that don't stop for a minute and that is both a wonder and a pity lloyd bacon who also directed 42nd street must have been the king of the depression era musicals and he was probably excited with the possibilities sound brought to the world of cinema for he filled this picture with it there mustn't be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking it's completely crazy i was thinking the movie deserved a 5 or a 6 tops because the pacing was very poor since it was insanely fast and i sometimes didn't know what was happening and what to think the characters seemed to just running to and fro places talking about things which didn't interest me and probably no one else i thought i was just going to be rewarded with a small headache i noticed lloyd bacon also cast the female lead in 42nd street ruby keeler and 42nd street was a movie whose ending was the best part of it and you know what it happened the same thing with footlight parade the ending is absolutely incredible it has become hands down the most impressive musical i have ever seen the final part presents us some musical numbers and those are believe me something that make seeing the other rest of the movie worth the numbers are flawless there are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second one suddenly the screen was filled with gorgeous and inventive camera work beautiful people and plain entertainment that made me forget my small headache,1
deathtrap runs like a play within a movie about who did what to whom as it primarily takes place on one set the premise is that an accomplished playwright whose star is falling receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student and so he plans to off his protege and appropriate his play to the loud protests of his wife or so you think for the first half of the movie past the halfway mark deathtrap begins to throw in twists and surprises that turn its premise on its head then right around and then in a mad spin all the time keeping its title appropriate it's an excellent mystery movie soaked in wit br br michael caine as the senior playwright plays himself in this movie a slightly loony and very dramatic brit no surprises here he does his usual good work he gets the best line of deathtrap which he executes perfectly what is your definition of success being gang banged in a state penitentiary br br christopher reeve on the other hand juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious and psychopathic young playwright he also gets to show off his very toned body which he must've retained coming off the superman movies br br caine and reeve have collaborated in another movie that's one of my favorite comedies noises off it similarly revolves around a play as well although this time caine is the director and reeve is an actor they are joined by comic veterans carol burnett john ritter marilu henner taxi and mark linn baker perfect strangers together they demonstrate the calamities that befall the bed hopping cast and crew of a play on the surface the movie looks to be mostly slapstick but upon watching you find that they are many subtle jokes that require more than one viewing to catch wish this underrated movie was available on dvd,1
what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probibly the only thing on film that has ever shocked me,1
first off this is no where near as bad as some of the other trash the sci fi channel has produced that isn't to say that grendel is a good film in fact it is very bad but it definitely had potential to be a lot better the flaws of the film come from character design character absurd additions to the story the visual effects the music and for the most part the acting br br when speaking of character design i of course mean the way our heroes and villains look beowulf and the other danes seem like ridiculous vikings rather than warriors of brute strength that helmet our main protagonist wears is just too silly grendel looks like the hulk but with strange tentacle attachments to his elbows br br the characters are very limited beowulf is same from beginning to end however finn a useless sidekick achieved some two dimensionality due thanks to his romantic subplot and unferth gets some notion as well as he becomes less conceited br br much like finn there are useless additions to this story to make it its own while still holding to the source material the crossbow that is gifted to beowulf is so ridiculous i'm surprised the cast didn't walk off the set besides additions there's omissions such as the underlying themes of christianity and paganism as well as the consequences of lying br br the special effects are mighty terrible grendel and his mother hag are poorly conceived and as such they're portrayal on screen is less than believable br br the music is overbearing especially when a character dies br br all in all this is not sci fi's worst film to date no it is actually one of the better films though trash it still it is it is good trash making it a guilty pleasure at best the only thing that works is the dialogue which is still wooden here and there br br i highly recommend you skip this film and watch robert zemeckis' take on the ancient story of beowulf simply because this film grendel is only half the tale and not the whole thing which garners this movie a three star review,0
having grown up in texas and less than 15 miles from what used to be gilley's i can tell you that this movie is nauseating the majority of texans do not live like this movie indicates the plot is weak and the fake accents are amusing and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all texans are beer drinking honky tonkin' rednecks the horribly fake texas accents is what kills it for me true there is a certain texas twang to most texans' accents but these people overdo it you can't get someone from new jersey and ohio to do texas accents it just doesn't work john travolta should have stuck to disco dancing or the 50s debra winger was more convincing as wonder girl than she is as a texan,0
this is simply put the worst movie i have ever seen it ranges from like 2 hours and the box art was totally misleading my friends and i rented it because we thought it would be a poor man's 300 you know to laugh at and make fun of no there is nothing funny about this movie only pain then the movie starts up and they are speaking some sort of different language we think 'oh its just the beginning ' but no from there the movie plummets and becomes more of like a super boring book you had to read in grade school where nothing literally happens for hours and the battle scenes rival those of 2 kids fighting on a playground omit cinematography and this movie belongs in trash compactor movies like this will lead to the world we see in wall e which by the way was a good movie,0
paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film i've ever seen often classed as a horror movie this i believe is a grave error some journo once called it the thinking person's nightmare on elm street and while i accept the logic of his conclusion i can't help but think it's a tag that is ill deserved and misleading those that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to demonstrate they're really not thinking at all br br in fact just attempting to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea quite simply paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart as someone wiser than me once said the film hits you on a completely emotional level which may go some way to explaining why my comments are so unrelentingly gushing to be honest i make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too saccharine for your taste stop reading now because there's more to come br br it's so rare to find a film that has at its heart the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us at this fragile time in our lives even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it all work in charlotte burke and elliott spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood often overlooked in a seamless and convincing way br br and yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away br br add to all this an incredibly talented director bernard rose imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you're ever likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why i have such affection and affinity for this film that no amount of words can express br br,1
i saw this at an arty cinema that was also showing last days and some charlie chaplin films based on the quality of the other features i decided to give immortel a chance i nearly walked out of this movie and i like science fiction the story is set in a futuristic new york city filled with blade runner style sky advertisements and some similar debates about cloning synthetic humans unfortunately the screenplay was not condensed enough for an hour and forty five minute movie three groups exist in this world humans artificial humans and egyptian gods the artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city the humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation the egyptian gods have a floating pyramid modeled on the great pyramid of khufu and complete with a deteriorated exterior leaving a smooth cap on the pyramid wouldn't a floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition the pyramid rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why it's there i won't bore you with the so called plot but there is lots of unnecessary gore and many gross out scenes the film as i said looks to have been influenced by blade runner and perhaps also by the fifth element and the matrix at the end of the film credits were listed thank yous to the united kingdom france and italy the film is french but uses british actors who don't speak french hence it is obvious that their french dialog has been dubbed this is a distraction and i also thought that switching back and forth between real humans and animations quite distracting it doesn't help that the animations are poor no better than a video game skip this one,0
the teasers for tree of palme try to pass it off as a sort of allegory for a fairy tale with actual meaning then immediately start raving about the animation i should have known what that meant br br the main character palme is a good example of the whole movie's problem one minute palme is a humble hero in search of himself the next a violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once took care of br br like all of the characters in the movie palme is poorly defined you do not bond with the characters at all although shatta has acquired a couple of fan girls it seems that the writer was more interested in cramming all the drama and complexity he could into this movie than actually exploring his characters' motivations and personalities br br new useless story lines were being introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the movie the writer seriously needed to streamline his story perhaps he was trying to be epic but it was simply too much information for a two hour movie however i can't help but wonder if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been better suited for a tv series or graphic novel br br in the last five minutes of the movie i simply could not endure the sheer lack of quality any longer and began laughing at how contrived the characters the relationships and the whole plot was i touched my companion and he started cracking up too as did a young man seated behind us we tried so hard to control ourselves but we simply could not take the terrible quality of this movie br br on the bright side the animation is incredible and viewers will find themselves admiring the lush backgrounds and charming character designs the animation almost guides you when you don't care about the characters it tells you how to feel,0
i sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn't take anymore it felt as though i'd watched dozens of episodes already and then it hit me there's nothing new here i've heard that joke on seinfeld i saw someone fall like that on friends an episode of happy days had almost the same storyline ect none of the actors are interesting here either some were good on other shows not here and others are new to a profession they should have never entered avoid this stinker,0
rated e br br i never actually owned a nintendo 64 but i have played one many times in my opinion along with conkers bad fur day super mario 64 is one of the best video games for the nintendo 64 system i have played this game plenty of times and its good every time if you have an n64 and don't have this game you should try to find it the original super mario bros games were side scrolling video games but super mario 64 has a 3d mario in a nice 3d environment the game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game you play as super mario and once again you must rescue princess and the 120 power stars from bowzer now you can do it in a 3d environment super mario 64 is a very fun and good n64 game and i recommend it br br 10 10,1
yeah i remember this one many years since i actually watched it the story was entirely surreal but nonetheless great what anyone who rates and reviews movies ought to bear in mind is what the respective movie aims at it's the same with first kid which follows a similar pattern certain movies like this one here just aim at plain and comical nonsense such movies can't be rated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer of course these movies lack quality lack a sophisticated storyline very often lack first class acting but if they do fulfil their primary premise that's okay i don't have this movie here on my list of all time favorites but i still thought it was funny had some very enjoyable sequences and made a good story brian bonsall is a smart actor anyway,1
i happened to borrow this movie from a friend knowing nothing about it and it turned out to be an outstanding documentary about a journey on an ancient vessel across vast expanses of the ocean thor heyerdahl had developed a theory that the ancient incas in peru managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to polynesia based on certain relics that are found in both places certain types of ancient sea going vessels that we know they had available analysis of ocean and wind currents and the knowledge that the incas did in fact travel in some undetermined amount at sea br br in order to test his hypothesis heyerdahl and his crew construct a vessel as closely as possible to what the ancient incas had available using only balsa wood and other materials available at the time and set out from lima peru's capital to try to reach the islands of polynesia some 5 000 miles away br br his theory like so much about ancient history is impossible to prove with 100 certainty but the coverage of their journey provides for strong support that he is right the film is really little more than narration of footage taken during the 100 day expedition but it is a very detailed description of what it was like and the trials and tribulations that they faced i often wish that academy award winning documentaries were easier to find and this one from more than 50 years ago is still as interesting and informative as i am sure it was when it was first released,1
loonatics unleashed is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters created by chuck jones the loony tunes have many spin offs and different versions some were good others not very much but loonatics it's the worst the concept is stupid and derivative of shows as the power rangers and teen titans there wasn't any similarity with the original characters and the stories are boring and poorly made the new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic this show just doesn't work this horrible waste of animation is a complete failure and this shouldn't have be nothing more than a bad joke lame zero stars,0
i have seen the short movie a few years ago after that i watch all sequels the first one is really not the best but it's the most popular one i've already watch the making of guinea pig 1 it's really great what these guys did also the sequels are excellent in the special effects take your chance to watch it,1
i noticed that a new hope and the empire strikes back are in the top 10 but that this one isn't even in the top 100 br br this movie has a bad reputation because of ewoks but there are so many reasons to love this movie br br the rescue of han solo from jabba this official wraps up the han solo in debt sub plot that was established when we first met the character in a new hope br br the emperor was finally revealled well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw the emperor as kids br br the speeder bike chase alright so this was a special effects moment but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films br br the 3 part climax 1 the battle of endor led by han and leia 2 luke confronts his father the fall of the emperor 3 the destruction of the second death star lando's moment br br the final celebration with our heroes like i said this movie gets a lot of crap because of the ewoks but i think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the empire our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other br br all in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the star wars story,1
spooks is enjoyable trash featuring some well directed sequences ridiculous plots and dialogue and some third rate acting br br many have described this is a uk version of 24 and one can see the similarities br br the american version shares the weak silly plots but the execution is so much slicker sexier and i suspect expensive br br some people describe weak comedy as gentle comedy br br this is gentle spy story hour the exact opposite of anything created by john le carre br br give me smiley any day,0
occasionally one is served a new entrée from foreign films that is their great attraction they take from life and serve it up raw american films rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society too many hang ups and a morbid fear of financial failure the almighty dollar determines their selections something which invites european directors in addition audiences world wide remain hungry for different films especially those which offer a savory bite out of the wretched suffering body of humanity despite the fear of directors or producers many audiences yearn for beauty poetry and the pristine flavor of life that is what the film to the left of the father offers to curious audiences a family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of it's obedience to tradition yet when the patriarch of a family forgets it's members are flesh and blood humans filled with raging unbridled dreams and dark passions then the two are set in motions against itself selton mello plays andré a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father raul cortez plays his father simone spoladore is ana a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters leonardo medeiros is pedro the elder brother the film offers much but does takes an extremely inordinate amount of time to say it,0
i'm a big fan of b5 having caught on only at the end of season three i faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was syndicated concluding that it was one of the most well thought out story arcs to ever hit television even the filler episodes were interesting the movies also were well produced and as entertaining as anything to hit the theaters br br which brings us to 'river of souls' naturally after seeing everything else i had high expectations martin sheen appears to be acting in an ed wood movie rather than a serious sci fi story the story itself might have looked good in outline form even made it to the story board however it suffers obviously when it came time to filling this notion out into a two hour movie there are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story there are places where they were obviously short of time and just improvised the dialog to fill the story out had this made the regular season it would have rated among the worst of the episodes,0
alone in the dark is one bad movie and tied with deuce bigalow for worst movie of the year i wish that was all i had to say but of course the imdb stipulates a word count and all that br br i'm in two minds about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie a low budget dreck like red zone cuba monster a go go and manos or a huge budget disgrace like gigli superbabies or this guff you see movies like monster a go go and manos happen because the director hasn't a clue movies like this happen because the director is a stupid money grabbing idiot who simply doesn't care about his audience br br it's more shocking when you consider that uwe boll the mastermind behind this shocking crap and already has some real garbage under his belt has created something that only happens once in a blue moon the really terribly bad horror film everything about it is a mess cheesy cgi bad plot insane random camera cuts and appalling soundtrack br br alone in the dark is a dreadful movie that should be watched by absolutely nobody woo hoo review over give me a bud roll on 2006 and may i never speak of this again br br don't watch this film,0
the late 80's saw an inexplicable rash of supernatural horror films set in gloomy penitentiary settings renny harlin's superbly gritty and moody prison got the whole haunted hoosegow ball rolling it was immediately followed by the markedly inferior the chair john saxon's enjoyably trashy death house the passable psycho picture destroyer and this hideously limp'n'lethargic exercise in hopelessly comatose tedium br br your usual annoying collection of horribly unsympathetic college student chowderheads lead by insufferably spineless tormented twerp alex the hugely unappealing nicholas celozzi go to alcatraz island to investigate the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden gruesome death of up and coming rock star sammy mitchell blandly played by toni basil of hey micky fame alex's brother becomes possessed by the evil demonic spirit of a vicious cannibalistic us civil war cavalry commandant and goes on the expected killing spree thus forcing wimpy alex to overcome his passivity and make a stand against this ghoulish specter br br although slickly photographed by nicholas von sternberg with a few decent gore set pieces and a fair amount of spooky atmosphere the film was shot on location in the dismal rusty rundown ruins of alcatraz island slaughterhouse rock nonetheless just doesn't cut it as a solid effective fright feature this is largely due to the uniformly obnoxious and unlikeable collegiate smartaleck characters a tiresomely smirky bunch whose inane comic antics prove to be grating rather than amusing the flat acting from a noticeably disinterested cast hurts matters all the more with onetime playboy playmate and undeniable blonde cutie pie hottie supreme hope marie carlton doing an especially irritating linnea quigley impersonation as the token oversexed nympho bimbo dimitri logothetis' direction displays a modicum of flashy visual style but the tone is unevenly pitched between grim seriousness and goofy horrendously sophomoric silliness and most damagingly ted landon's sloppy inconsistent overly complicated and finally quite confusing script miserably fails to develop the necessary internal logic to make the far fetched story even remotely plausible in other words this stinker sadly succeeds in making a scant 90 minutes seem like an excruciatingly drawn out cinematic jail sentence,0
i enjoyed american movie so i rented chris smith's first film which i thought was a documentary too in the first minute i saw that it wasn't but i gave it a go br br what a dead end film being true to life hardly serves you if you're merely going to examine tediousness esp tediousness that we're already familar with br br i'm sorry but will it come as a relevation to anyone that 1 a lot of jobs suck and 2 most of them are crappy minimum wage jobs in the service sector i knew that before i saw the film it didn't really provide an examination of that anyway as while the film struggles to feel real handheld camera no music etc what's going on hardly plays out as it would in the real world br br would an employer be so cheerful to randy when he picks up his check after randy quit on him after 3 days when the guy said he expected him to stay 6 months or the day after abandoning his job and screwing up the machine he was working on that everyone would be so easy on him br br a big problem is our hero randy this guy is a loser not because he's stuck in these jobs or has a crummy apartment or looks like one he's a dope he doesn't pay attention or even really try at these jobs he has zero personalty if i had to hire someone he wouldn't make it past the interview br br i'm looking forward to what chris smith does next but guys knock off the this is an important film stuff american job doesn't work,0
i am a big fan of old horror movies and since i am middle aged old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920's to 1960's period i am not a big fan of more modern horror movies with one exception being creepshow 1 which i thought was great i could reminisce about the stories there but i really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with hal holbrook and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending all the stories were great though so why did i like them so much the characters had some decent development the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear and the funny bits were really funny this sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent i am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and i turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on imdb com lol when george kennedy and an old dorothy lamoure get top billing it's telling you something 4 of 10 also romero's expertise is hard to find here they must had told him to tone it down to a pg standard i don't know what this was rated at but it looks pg to me and that's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on it's shown on the encore cable channel if your dieing yuck yuck to see it,0
i wish i could give this movie a zero cheesy effects and acting the only reason to see this movie is so you can see how bad it is lets start with the kid who plays brian what a geek i couldn't believe the mullet then there was the talking to himself i guess they couldn't just have the movie be silent but still of course they had to have him skinny dipping too not something i wanted to see but jared gave a great performance compared to the special effects department everything from the bear to the crash was something i could do myself and better i seriously doubt that gary paulsen had anything to do with the production seeing as the movie was not even called hatchet finally i do not think the writer had ever read the book seeing as nothing was the same i think the book was great but this movie stunk like a smelly goat,0
soapdish may go down as one of the single most under rated movies ever made br br a stellar unselfish cast who understood exactly where the movie was going and the roles they played in it while everyone hammed it up there was no one upmanship kline showed wit and great physical comedy goldberg and downey knew how to carry on a funny conversation while someone else was talking i could just go on br br do not pass this movie by,1
at two and a quarter hours this is a sometimes slow moving thoughtful film interrupted by vast sword battles the battle between darkness and light is signified by the constant motif of the blazing sun and is superbly demonstrated by a three way fight between 'demons' bandits and soldiers in a forest during an eclipse br br be prepared following a stunning sword fight under lightning filled skies the end of this picture will have you scratching your head in puzzlement,1
i admit i have a weakness for alternate history stories from its a wonderful life to groundhog day to 12 01 among those greats is this little gem it's pretty difficult to get through mr destiny without giving a nod of appreciation to each and every cast member from the goodhearted james belushi to the murderous courtney cox this movie lacks the gravitas and scale to make it a great film but it's a fine cheer up on a rainy afternoon it's also a great rental for an inexpensive date,1
aardman does it again next to pixar aardman animation proves again and again how to do animation properly br br i had a great time watching the first episode of creature comforts i thought it translated well for american audiences my only concern is that most of the audiences aren't going to get the subtle humor in this show br br having been a fan of the bbc version and the short film i knew what i was in for when i sat down to watch this the animators did a great job matching up pre recorded voices to a perfect match animal look at the first episode with the goat who sounds stoned and the dogs on the street that keep calling each other dawg br br is this for everyone not by a long shot in fact i'd be happy to see the show last for a full season but like i said before audiences aren't going to get it,1
pialat films people in extreme emotional situations usually with several violent scenes in la gueule ouverte he's dealing with the devastating effects on a woman's husband and son as she dies of cancer in a nos amours the teenage girl's sexual experimentation leads to violent confrontations with her family here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to take up with a sexy ex con her motivation is a little cloudy since loulou is incapable of reading or discussing anything more challenging than tv shows on the other hand he's got a fabulous body i wonder why depardieu never made a sports movie to show off that physique he would have been great as a rugby player br br the casting is impressive isabelle huppert isn't allowed to give a bland inexpressive performance she has given many depardieu plays loulou with all the dynamism and charm you could want see the scene in the bar where he's stabbed in the gut runs away and seeks treatment then soon restarts with nelly guy marchand with those coal black eyes and distressed look plays nelly's husband beautifully it's a fine repeat of the pairing in coup de foudre,1
tony hawk underground came at a point where the series was really starting to lose its luster tony hawk pro skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series really up in the air on what neversoft and activision could do with the series that would be different and interesting br br underground introduced the storymode which was very cool because it made a whole new world for tony hawk pro skater fans another feature introduced which fans pretty much argued for and that was being able to get off the skateboard which is nice because now you can actually climb run and do all sorts of new things br br the levels are good neversoft also improved on an issue that started with pro skater 3 and that was the length of the level designs the first two games for the ps1 n64 and dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long and some hidden features in some pro skater 3 and 4 were shortened because of a handful of features that were added and really pushed the systems too their limits in this version they shortened those features there isn't as many people wondering the streets in fact there are almost none in some levels and the graphics and the skating physics are toned down a little but not a lot br br this game does have one con the storymode is a little short of course this is neversofts first time doing this with tony hawk pro skater so that is understandable however with that being said you will definitely finish this game within a day br br overall a great addition that was very refreshing,1
me and my sister have right now watch that movie we have laugh to the deaf can u imagine on covers there is nomination for oscar first musician have mix about 4 5 different style of music and the music is not synchronized with the scenes and the character moves br br main character silvester do not fit in there he look like mexican tarzan br br russian soldiers are everything but not russian faces ok the main points 1 airplane called charter painted in black br br 2 what is an idea when rambo go to jump from the airplane but he stuck rope mix 3 a girl the best scene is when she dies she means a lot to him he knows her for ages he cries for her o my god samurai 4 how many arrows is he got his arrow bag is always full of the arrows i didn't notice a scene where he collect them but i have seen the scene where arrow stay in the vietnam solder head that is very important 5 how many rockets helicopter can hold real one i have seen 4 but rambos have hit about 20 of them br br 6 the main part what the russian special army helicopters do in vietnam after the war 7 first scene when he enter into vietnam's camp his first idea was to liberate the refuge who is standing on the tree on the open space' wow what an idea than again 1 with the knife u can cut the iron wire maybe only made in vietnam 2 mortar using for hit one running man o my god u americans really need to learn about the weapons do u know how much it takes to calibrate the mortar i think writer have been watching to much movies from ii world war,0
i really love this movie saw it again last week after 3 years or so this movie is perfect great acting great story great directing camera work music it is a gift to show it to someone you love too bad jaco van dormael did not make more movies after this one top 5 work really br br today it's 3 years and 3 days later then the comment above it was never posted because it was not more than 10 lines anyway i saw le huitieme jour again yesterday this is with no doubt in my movie top 3 together with cinema paradiso which is also a masterpiece the soundtrack is also really good i am really curious about jaco von dormael's new movie i hope it will complete my movie top 3 if you see this movie rent it or even better buy it because you will want to see it again,1
good action and interesting plot having seen the original i must say it was an interesting improvement and showed more of the movie good cast meaningful acting although it would nice to see some more expansion in the action scenes rather than the background story fun movie to watch and keeps you alert all the time 7 10 is a right vote i think,1
a shaky hand held camera was used presumably to give the film a documentary look but the effect was so exaggerated that i started to get motion sickness just from watching it it looked like someone with cerebral palsy was holding the camera no offense meant to cp sufferers but i don't think you would expect to get much work as a cinematographer the camera work was so nauseating and so distracting that my wife and i considered it unwatchable and gave up on it after 10 minutes of torture i checked back a while later it was showing on tv and it hadn't gotten any better i suggest giving this one a miss unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you may have eaten,0
ordinarily i really enjoy movies like chances are but i wasn't quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons the first half was pretty well done overall with alex finch dying and being reincarnated in a new body played by robert downey jr he meets up with his wife cybill shepherd and friend ryan o'neal and his daughter who is now grown up the scenes with them meeting again and downey rediscovering who he once was are well done and there is a good amount of emotion and happiness once shepherd finally believes its really her husband reincarnated but from there the film goes downhill there are several sex related scenes that turned me off completely especially downey and shepherd wanting to get together again despite the difference in their age now after that however the film manages to end in the most satisfying way possible considering the circumstances of the plot i was disappointed because i did not expect the film to become so immoral by the end there was great potential with this story and the scenes in heaven are well done there is a good theme song sung by peter cetera and cher but ultimately the film is not great for a better similar film try heaven can wait decent but i really kind of wish i hadn't seen it because of the scenes in the second half br br out of,1
what can i say about cruel intentions 2 well i can say in all honesty i will only watch this film again if i am fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork orange style br br the film 'stars' robin dunne no i never heard of him either whose awful impression of ryan phillipe made me cringe throughout in a case of terrible casting dunne attempts and fails to carry off playing a handsome charismatic charmer since the actor is not handsome nor charismatic nor charming the character is left wholly unbelievable amy adams she was in an episode of buffy one time tries to pick up where sarah michelle gellar left off and bring scheming katherine to life however adams is not that good a an actress and her performance was flat and lacking in any real emotion often she looked like she was reading cue cards just off camera there were two good actors in the film however barry flatman saw 2 saw 3 and mimi rogers mrs kensington in austion powers made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of sebastian and katherine and are the only reason why i rated the film as a 2 not a 1 br br the film itself is a poor version of the original with such lows as carbon copy's of dialogue and mimicked scenes which lacked the originality of the previous film br br i think that as a tv show it might have worked but if it had been recasted with people who could actually act in the main parts,0
my god this movie is awfully boring i am a big fan of gina gershon when i rented this movie i expected a romantic drama and some great performance from gershon gershon is great as always but she is not right actress for this role she is too good for rade serbedzija the romance between gershon and serbedzija's characters is too unconvincing and i absolutely hated serbedzija's character a wonman organizer he is not charming in anyway in the movie how did dr lauren graham gershon is beyond my comprehension maybe sean connery robert deniro or harrison ford would have done a better job on this role but they don't have the european ish looking i guess any way i was so bored druing the movie if you are looking for a good gina gershon movie check out bound her best film so far if you are looking for a romantic film about a younger woman and an older man try some harrison ford or sean connery movies gina gershon is so underrated and she deserves better chance than this i wish her to make better choice in the future,0
back in the 1970s wpix ran the adventures of superman every weekday afternoon for quite a few years every once in a while we'd get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air superman and the mole men i always looked forward to those days watching it recently i was surprised at just how bad it really was br br it wasn't bad because of the special effects or lack thereof true george reeves' superman costume was pretty bad the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible and true the mole men's costumes were even worse what was supposed to be a furry covering wouldn't have fooled a ten year old since the zippers sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious but these were forgivable shortcomings br br no what made it bad were the contrived plot devices time and again superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating a lynch mob is searching for the creatures rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to lois and the pr man the creatures are cornered again he stands around watching and talking but doesn't save them until they're shot luke benson the town's rabble rouser shoots at him attempted murder to any reasonable person but superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems superman had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud but never once took advantage of them br br that said both george reeves and phyllis coates played their characters well seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles if only they had been given a better script to work with,0
i missed the first 10 or so minutes of the movie but don't think watching it from the beginning would've made any difference i found the film extremely boring and was disappointed with the acting i remember patrick swayze and some of the other actors roy marsden for instance in outstanding roles but they all disappointed here due to a very weak script kind solomon's mines the very short part of the movie inside the mines was about as exciting as watching paint dry and i doubt that even a pre school kid would've been spell bound by watching the fight of the warriors the entire movie was reminiscent of a cheaply produced american tv series give me indiana jones any day,0
usually any film with sylvester stallone is usually going to suck ass rambo first blood part ii was no exception to this the only movies that sylvester stallone were in that were good were rocky and first blood this film is extreamly unrealistic and boring it has action but not very good action i didn't enjoy watching it and i would never ever watch this again no wonder why it won the razzie award for worst picture i would give this a 3 10 the only reason why it got the 3 was because it had somewhat good action but not good enough,0
br br what can i say this is one of the most perfect films ever made its a throwback to the glitxy sterling romantic comedies of the 1940s but with a modern touch the screenplay bursts with wit charm humor and tenderness the cinematograpy is breathtaking nyc never looked so beautiful and of course there is the cast dudley moore turns in the performance of his career as loveable drunken arthur bach he is also wistful and real one of the film's best lines is his poignant not everyone who drinks is a poet some of us drink because we're not poets the great sir john gielgud won a much deserved oscar for his splendid performance as hobson arthur's valet and caretaker although he considered it a take the money and run role he brings to the character all the talent experience and bravura of an expert tragidian and a sly comedian the supporting cast is also out of thisworld from geraldine fitzgerald's sassy grandma bach to stephen elliott's bombastic mafioso br br the score is also extremely memorable and compliments the film perfectly the only real problem with the film is the ill fated sequel it spawned,1
have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from beverly hills 90210 were thrown into a thai jail if so this is your movie this is midnight express for the mtv crowd that would be ok but the story was poorly executed contrived plot twists poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound this slight film did not earn the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being potential spoiler and impossibly preposterous plot line the faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out this moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint later the same hotel employee is somehow found and bangkok is a big city mind you ive been there and testifies against the girls as if a couple of free mai tais warrant 40 years in prison c'mon rent another day in paradise instead,0
enchanting romantic innovative and funny the vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled exceeding better known death romances such as ghost while we know intuitively that peter and june will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long long stairway the joy is in the journey the moral of the tale of course is timeless love conquers all but the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur with more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures the directors' vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later far into the cgi era br br yet for all the cosmic scale powell and pressburger knew an essential truth the best story is told at the smallest level the wonderfully determinedly romantic aspect of stairway is captured with ultimate simplicity june's teardrop preserved on a rose petal br br this film like the story and the set itself is one for the ages,1
claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the movie too long face only shots where you most of the time get the feeling that the lower half of the film is missing that the screen is cut off because there seems to be important actions going on but you cannot see them there is anyway already too much confusion in the movie so these viewing angles make it worse and do not contribute to artful visuals br br i like artfully made movies and unconventional camera work i can handle deep and slow movies but this one is trying too hard to be something artful and fails in my opinion painfully br br nothing to get attached to to any of the characters because they are not worked out well enough to work out characters more is needed than just minute long face shots at least with this set of script director actors br br i wonder whether some of the not so good acting is due to the script and director or due to the actors br br i will stay away from films both written and directed by le you for sure in the future br br what an annoying film even for someone who would be interested in that part of history and for someone who spent time in shanghai,0
one of if not the worst film to come out of britain in the 80s br br this tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who 'seduces' two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux posh wife has nothing to redeem it br br in turns gratuitous puerile uncouth and unrealistic this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny provocative intellectual and controversial br br perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of george costigan michelle holmes and siobhan finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script it's no surprise that this was the late andrea dunbar's only work to make it onto the screen complete and utter rubbish on every level,0
this movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast a gripping story with a chilling ending great music and excellent visuals without significant special effects it is interesting to note though that like so much science fiction its predictions for the future don't appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted that's not to say we're out of the woods yet but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition it shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics 1984 2001 a space odyssey compare its space station with our international space station and isaac asimov's i robot positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990's,1
recently i was looking for the newly issued wide screen dvd of fly away home and came upon interesting title that i had never heard of grey owl the fact that it was a richard attenborough film caught my attention he responsible for such fine films as gandhi chaplin and shadowlands i noticed that the screenplay was by william nicholson author of shadowlands this special edition was full of interesting sounding material and the price was just under 10 00 so i chanced it bought it wow what a beautiful film pierce brosnan stars as archie grey owl a real life trapper in the 1930s who came to love and respect the wild lands of canada and worked to help protect them brosnan who starred in a james bond film gives a shaded warm powerful performance as does annie galipeau as the young woman who loves and influences his feeling for the creatures of the land especially the beaver a fine score by george fenton the crucible and beautiful photograhy by roger pratt add greatly to the effectiveness of the film and the extras on this dvd are something else includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the real grey owl as well as audio commentary tracks by attenborough and producer jake eberts 2 featurettes and many other fine additions plus options for those having access to a pc with dvd rom features grey owl has been released directly to dvd in the united states a fact that richard attenborough attributes to hollywood's lack of interest in distributing something that isn't loaded with a lot of violence and sex this is a film that not only informs and entertains but leaves you with something to think about i had a very warm feeling at the films conclusion and a whole new love and understanding for beavers grey owl is a very fine film worth checking out this is one i look forward to sharing with others,1
i really love this show it's like reading a book and each chapter leaves you wanting more it gets you thinking about what is going to happen in the next episode and the struggle of trying to maintain their friendship throughout the years after each episode ends it leaves a sweet bitter taste in your mouth knowing that one the show was good you can't wait for the next episode and it really gets you thinking about what actually happens to the friends throughout the twenty years and two the fact that the show has been put on hiatus and we will not see the show finish in it's entirety fox obviously do not know what they have done they claim that they are losing viewers in the 18 49 category they clearly do not know what people want to see if they got rid of a good show such as reunion i have one query though that i would like to raise if they were to bring the show back and it went on for another season how would it work since each episode is done in the period of a year and the story is based on what happens in the span of twenty years your answers are most welcome bring back reunion bring back reunion,1
this film was so predictable that during the entire time you're hoping that the obvious suspect is innocent and there's some other big twist still coming however it doesn't he just continues to act creepy and she continues to ignore it mary found very incriminating evidence at his place and she still trusted him and what was that baiting the trap there was no trap she confronted him he said excuse me i have to go kill someone he left and that was the end of it they make attempts to use other suspects like that one older carnival girl at the end but they're completely underdeveloped actually all the characters are underdeveloped they have no depth and the setting is just plain strange who hangs out in a recycling factory its choppy and nothing is well developed for example when she leaves his place after having the beer and he finds the pics and she runs out and he catches her and they end up having sex in that car what was that her reactions weren't portrayed in the car she acted scared like it could have been practically rape but then all we see is her showering the next morning booooooooo it could have been so much better sooo much better,0
the costumes and make up were grand there were some exceptionally funny lines and the role was made for jim carrey carrey did as good a job as could be done given the rather disappointing script writing sure this was mostly a movie for kids but if you are going to spend this much money making a movie you really ought to at least give the story enough body to go beyond that of dr seuss i expected more from ron howard it's worth a see but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a major classic by any measure,1
words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is it is a series of random unfunny clips about everything from a stupid batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady really disturbing the only remotely amusing thing about the underground comedy movie is watching joey buttafuoco the best actor in this movie also it is rated nc 17 shunning away the only people that might tolerate it,0
did anyone else notice whenever they are in the car each time the camera takes a new angle they switch roads like in one scene it is a one lane residential with sidewalks next they are on a multiple lane highway with a divider next a two lane country road with double yellow lanes i can understand a low budget but that was just sloppy film work br br i also read the other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie i think that if you are a fan of paul reiser and his comedy then you may enjoy this movie if however you find his work not funny then i would recommend staying away from this one,0
only on a very rare occasion does an episode of the x files fail to generate any excitement or does the episode contain anything which is just totally boring to watch a detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstances the deaths are linked to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths took place mulder has devised a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues has come back reincarnated as the little girl and is exacting revenge now for the bizarre bit the little girl has no connection at all and seems to just a random person chosen as the reincarnation i think this was slightly lazy writing by the writers and this episode ranks as one of the worst in x files history,0
i see a lot of movies saw the original wargames years ago and loved it computers where still a big mystery for the most of us and the movie was convincing in it's own way br br this one however looks like a low budget wednesday night special total crap from start to finish br br the plot is so weak you won't believe it until you see the movie which i would not recommend in the first place i can not point out one actor that actually did a good job in this movie but hey with that script i would've been surprised if anyone could do a good job acting lots of cliché scenes cgi looks like it's taken out of the '86 version br br bah no i'm getting in a bad mood just writing about this do not watch this movie br br life's to short to waste it on watching crappy movies,0
hardly the stuff dreams are made of is this pursuit of the brass ring by a naive hustler jon voigt and his lame con man sidekick dustin hoffman soon to forge a friendship based on basic survival skills br br a daring film for its time and a foremost example of the kind of gritty landscape being explored in the more graphic films of the '60s symbolic of the end of innocence in american films since it was the only x rated film to win a best picture oscar br br jon voigt is the male hustler who comes to the big city expecting to find women an easy way to make money when they fight over his body but soon finds the city is a cold place with no welcome mat for his ilk befriended by a lame con man dustin hoffman he goes through a series of serio comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter ready to leave the confines of a cold water flat for the sunshine promised in florida a land his friend ratzo dreams of living in br br but even in this final quest the two are losers john schlesinger has directed with finesse from a brilliant script by waldo salt and john barry's haunting midnight cowboy theme adds to the poignant moments of search and desperation br br summing up a true american classic honestly facing a tough subject and daring to show the underbelly of certain aspects of city life,1
i have watched this episode more often than any other tftc episode it is that enjoyable and it is quite scary but all in good ghoulish fun a woman kills her 2nd husband but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a ragged santa claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl a visit at that very moment mary traynor who i seem to remember from snl or some other tv comedy skit show is the evil wife and larry drake plays the lunatic in the dingy santa outfit i had forgotten santa was played by drake over the years his santa is an unstoppable force and quite frightening at times you can probably guess how santa finally gets into the house the episode is played for laughs but it also can be pretty intense at times,1
running man viciously lampoons the modern day american media complex and hits its target dead center it may be an easy target but they pull it off none the less rm effortless takes on pro wrestling featuring some pro wrestlers as the hunters network television the nielsen ratings the american government suggesting it's entertainment oriented anyway crime punishment and a half dozen other things along the way it's a far cry from the original stephen king novella and arnold is not the ben richards of the novella either but who cares it's basically a arnie flick with all the well choreographed action sequences and one liners such an undertaking requires,1
recipe for one of the worst movies of all time a she male villain who looks like it escaped from the wwf has terrible aim with a gun that has inconsistent effects the first guy she shoots catches on fire but when she shoots anyone else they just disappear and takes time out to pet a deer then you got the unlikable characters 30 year old college students a lame attempt at a surprise ending and lots lots more avoid at all costs,0
i'm a big porsche fan and the car was the best star in this film br br haim the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80's is bland as per usual and commenting on back up from minor characters actors would be pointless needless to say they were all very average it's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80's with some weird clothes some good shots of the colorado backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plot br br all in all please don't waste your time watching this unless you love 80's movies corey haim or like myself love old school porsches this one in particular looks great because life's too short to watch crappy movies,0
i'll get to the movie in a minute first someone wanted proof about clinton's comments at georgetown where he claimed that the usa deserved the 9 11 attacks well here's what clinton said br br in the first crusade when the christian soldiers took jerusalem they first burned a synagogue with 300 jews in it and proceeded to kill every woman and child who was a muslim on the temple mount i can tell you that story is still being told today in the middle east and we are still paying for it br br we're still paying for it whaddya mean we paleface the marines didn't storm the temple mount br br but in truth clinton never really came out and flatly said that we deserved 9 11 like all his statements during his presidency he implied that we deserved 9 11 just point out fact a b c and maybe d and let the listener deduce that they must add up to conclusion x when in truth most of clinton's facts added up to guacamole br br but that's beside the point we're here to talk movies not politics unfortunately when oliver captain conspiracy stone does a movie you can't escape his warped politics it was only a matter of time before he focused his paranoia and bitterness on the reagan era and what better time than when stone's dreams almost came true on the day reagan nearly bought the farm unable to find any nefarious plots or schemes in hinckley's assassination attempt he invents one with al haig from a simple misunderstanding of the chain of constitutional authority haig is transformed from a public servant who really should have brushed up on his remedial civics into a raving megalomaniac you almost expect haig to rub his hands together like montgomery burns and tell cap weinberger to release the hounds stone even recruits the smarmiest person in hollywood to play our former secretary of state richard dreyfuss a guy you love to hate on sight br br overall the movie is ok average hovering on below average don't bother renting or buying try to catch it on cable 4 out of 10,0
i wasn't going to watch this show but i'm glad i did the critics of this just don't get it it's one of the funniest and most entertaining thing on t v at the present moment though when the interviews were done with common folks they probably seemed useless but put them in the mouth of animals and insects and it's a laugh riot i laughed so hard i had tears in my eyes the pig with the babies suckling and her mother is priceless the husband and wife birds talking about health problems and the male bird taking a crap after the wife said she was constipated completely broke me up creature comforts is the most imaginative show i've ever seen in awhile hopefully it will be back next summer when this run is over,1
this really doesn't do the blues justice it starts out badly with images from the voyager probe and blind willie mctell or was it blind lemon jefferson someone blind anyway apparently narrating from outer space and telling us the life stories of various blues musicians corny as it is this might be the visually most interesting part of this documentary afterwards the only thing to see is actors incompetently mouthing the classic tunes filmed in fake 20s black and white intercut with the likes of beck and shemekia copeland raping the same songs afterwards this is a good device to show us why the old blues greats were really so great but it doesn't make for compelling viewing there is hardly anything in here that could justify making it a film and not a radio play nobody should be forced to see these badly done reenactments it's a shame for wenders scorsese and especially for the blues avoid at all costs,0
the problems with this film are many but i will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones first of all while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about manhattan life the reality was that everything as usual in movies and tv was about something bizarre usually of a sexual nature the story lines were thin or nonexistent and virtually every scene camera shot line of dialog and expressed emotion was absolutely and totally fake it finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that i walked out something no uncommon for me in recent years i would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program but i believe the at one time pre amelia talented director mira nair took part in this disgusting travesty so perhaps the directorial talent in america has descended en masse into the cesspool,0
anyone who had never seen anything like the fight scenes in the matrix has never seen this movie the fight scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath yuen woo ping who also did the fights in the matrix and the fight scenes are somethin br br li plays a supersoldier who feels no pain who now lives a life as a pacifist librarian ya got me when other evil supersoldiers begin killing off local drug lords to take over the drug trade li teams up with his cop buddy to help stop them br br there are some absolutely crazy things going on in this movie one badguy gets his arm lopped off with a pane of glass and hardly notices the fights scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches the body count is way up there li has seldom been better and he has surrounded himself with a bevy of beautiful female costars yip kicks some serious ass as a fellow supersoldier anthony wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord no suprises there he makes a cameo in every hk movie it's unfortunate they don't make action movies like this in the us i wouldn't have to sit through all of these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action that i crave so much recommended,1
the movie is bad nothing special just a kid movie with no serious thing in it there is though one reason to watch this for the animal talk some of them are so funny in what they say you just can't stop laughing so if you want to hear a dog in the dog pound saying i'm keyser soze or another animal saying you're a dead cat walking or many other funny one liners see it cause there's no other good movie to watch it vote 4 out of 10,0
well let me just say something about these actors they really were a good decision and from experience having actors really brings the dialogue to life if you walk into this even fifteen minutes late you'll be in for a shock the movie will have already began you don't want to miss the first few jokes assuming you came to not miss any jokes br br wow i have never seen a movie that ended with such a final ending not to be harsh i mean i loved it but it just surprised me that it really kept going until it stopped but i'm getting ahead of myself lets start with the very start of it when it began the plot outline goes like this there is this man and not to give away any spoilers spoiler alert he hasn't had any sex ever they use this plot device to set the story moving and there are intentionally or not it could go either way some funny situations had by the main characters some containing irony and jokes and awkward situations you know br br the director uses the advancements in technology by combining the film shot on the set and scripted dialog some music and jokes to make a funny movie designed as a comedy where he takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with an entirely full movie in between i went into this movie expecting to see a funny comedy because of what i already knew about it and left feeling as though i had just left a theater that just played a funny comedy ten stars,1
i got this one a few weeks ago and love it it's modern light but filled with true complexities of life it questions and answers just like other eytan fox movies this is my favorite along with jossi jagger this pictures a lot more universally than only the bubbles we may live in you don't need to be jewish or homosexual to enjoy this i'm not but the movie goes directly to my top ten movies at first it seems like pure entertainment but it does make you think further relationships we have to live with are superficial meaningful deep fatal you name it you don't know what's coming and you definitely don't know where this story is heading as you watch it the first time it is worth seeing several times fox movies include great bonus material here a great music video and the making of including explanation of the title interviewing lior ashknenazi who plays himself in the movie and arabs with doubts about the israeli life styles,1
when i started watching fay grim i had no idea that it was a sequel to henry fool now the latter was not a movie that i envisioned as having a sequel but one has arrived and it's quite good i assume that you've seen the original so i won't explain it this one starts with fay parker posey living with her son whom she had with deadbeat henry thomas jay ryan simon james urbaniak is still in jail one day the son gets expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school but this is no ordinary toy it holds a secret that explains much of what happened in the first movie and this secret delves deeper into geopolitics than syriana br br i must say that i'm quite impressed with what hal hartley has accomplished here maybe this one doesn't quite reach the original's quality but it certainly takes a good look at what's going on in the world and the end leaves open the possibility for another sequel br br also starring jeff goldblum,1
as a sequel this is not a bad movie i actually liked it better than the 1st one i found it more entertaining it seemed like it was shot documentary style at first this bothered me as i thought it just looked too low budget but it grew on me and it made the movie seem more authentic this movie has more dry one liners than the original which is a good thing in my opinion i do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the characters it almost becomes a parody of itself which may be the point this movie at least has some suspense which the 1st one did not have in my view it has some of the same great music from the original which is great the acting again was pretty decent for the most part though like i said some of it seemed over the top i also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just don't seem to flow like the rest of the movie overall though i thought this was a pretty sequel my rating for return to cabin by the lake is 7 10,1
i remember i loved this movie when it came out i was 12 years old had a commodore 64 and loved to play rambo on it i was therefore really thrilled when i got to buy this movie really cheap i put it in my vcr and started up man this movie is really bad sylvester stallone says like 3 words in the entire movie except for that awful sentimental speech at the end and has the same expression on his face all the way and that stupid love thing in the middle it's just so amazingly predictable i just ended up fast forwarding the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else,0
my ten year old liked it for me it was hard to get through it christopher lloyd played it way over the top and the suit was tedious and unfunny sorry to see jeff daniels in this,0
a young only 21 director with great talent a powerful scenario young and ambitious cast with all theatrical background br br one of the first tries of a thriller in turkish cinema which seems in the future we'll have some more based on the success br br shot on high definition video the movie is perhaps effected on world thrillers especially the american thrillers the technical and cinematographic character is quite well done the scenes are all well worked on not too much blood but sufficient enough to make you think you're in a blood bath too br br the scenario is quite wise but with certain clues a clever audience can easily predict what's going on and at the end when everything settles down you're getting somehow weird to conclude the result br br well done tiglon one of the biggest dvd distributors in turkey it is not easy to decide for such a movie in their first try as a production company,1
if you love kung fu films and you haven't seen this movie you are cheating yourself this movie is one of the only kung fu cheapies that could be recommended for fans of all types of film normally it takes a die hard fan of the genre to see anything in these films but this one has it all the story is well told and complete the fight scenes are great and tend to end before you're completely bored with them unlike crouching tiger throw in a little mystery and torture and you've got yourself one heck of a movie see this one at all costs heck my wife even enjoyed it br br wu du it br br 9 out of 10 br br,1
i work at a blockbuster store and every week we have movies that come in with just a few copies these are the kind of movies that the sci fi channel shows the kind of movie that nobody ever wants and only that idiots rent when they bring it back i ask them was it any good they say no we turned it off after 15 minutes movies with terrible computer generated super imposed monsters and such like very unappealing br br this is the same type of movie that grendel is and absolute waste of time if you want a reasonably and only reasonably good beowulf based movie then try beowulf grendel starring gerard butler who is also starring in the eagerly anticipated 300 as king leonidas of sparta br br plus later this year we have another beowulf movie with a star studded cast ranging from anthony hopkins and brendan gleeson to angelina jolie and john malkovich br br but don't let that get your hopes up like we all did with eragon or we are all in for another big disappointment br br and regarding rentals here is my rule of thumb if there is only one or two copies don't rent it because its a load of crap this is true 99 9 of the time usually not true if the title is foreign or a documentary,0
if you want scream or anything like the big studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother this well written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense how children interpret the world and the violence in it our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends all here but not flatly on the surface you could technically call it a monster movie even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit beast some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores though in fact the less you see of the creature the better fessenden successfully continues george romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out,1
i love all of the movies by michael landon jr and michael landon jr's casting of dale midkiff as clark davis could not of been any better dale midkiff has the ways to pull off this character br br this movie kept me spellbound from start to finish br br the death of missie willies baby girl with the timing of clarks visit was only gods timing how they dealt with the death and how clark helped them do so was that of a fathers love br br although there are 3 movies before this one love comes softly loves enduring promise loves long journey i feel you can see this movie and understand it easily yet leave and want to see the previous 3 movies due to the history all the characters have behind them br br michael landon jr is an excellent director br br i look forward to many more movies from him in the future,1
this is an extremely long movie which means you may become very bored before it becomes interesting but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent attachment in your sympathies br br if you are moved by the guilt of the loathsome you will find it particularly heart wrenching because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak if you can love a monster you'll cry for magnus pym the spy who betrays everyone notably his country his friends and family a man who has also been manipulated and moulded since childhood by those same people br br there isn't one truly likeable character in the entire story not one loyal 'moral' personality to sympathise with but watching the whole thing without the help of a tissue would be quite remarkable br br i really enjoyed it in the end well worth it for people who like inciteful movies about baser human character,1

it was supposed to be the last freddy movie and it was for over 10 years you would think they would have tried to get a good movie done but they turned out giving us the worst of the series and that's saying a lot the plot made no sense i seriously can't remember it all the main characters were idiots you really wanted them dead and freddy's wisecracks were even worse than usual the only remotely good bit about this was a brief and funny cameo by johnny depp the first nightmare movie was his first br br also i originally saw it in a theatre were the last section reaccounting freddy's childhood was in 3 d well the 3 d was lousy faded colors and the image going in and out of focus also the three flying skulls which were supposed to be scary i think had the opposite reaction from my audience everybody broke down laughing looks even worse on tv in 2 d pointless and stupid very dull also skip this one and see freddy vs jason again,0
more like psychological analysis of movies but psycho does sound better as a header the man in charge of the movie the narrator if you will does depict movies here in his own way most of them are classics but all of them are listed here at imdb and i'd strongly advise you to see them especially the hitchcock movies solyaris conversation and the lynch movies because slavoj zizek will reference them br br or in other words he might spoil them for you i don't remember if he spoiled more than those i've listed i think the chaplin movies too but as i wrote it'd be best if you watch them all beforehand in the imdb listing there is a movie missing that i did report to them so it might get up there pretty soon it's a meg ryan movie but it's a only a brief snippet not big of a deal anyways br br zizek views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to if you're open minded to see things through another perspective even if that does destroy your favorite movie a bit for you it doesn't mean it will do that but it could,1
fascinating movie based on a true story about an australian woman lindy chamberlain meryl streep accused of killing her baby daughter she insists that a dingo took her baby but the story is highly suspicious the film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case the way australians interpreted what was presented in the media and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman's conviction based on barely any hard evidence i love films that question the media and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system i've always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 angry men before they go through with their duties it's not as has often been said a liberal movie but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge a cry in the dark is likewise clinical schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic some may find the film boring or dry but i found it engaging,1
i recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him her the chemistry between johnny weissmuller and maureen o'sullivan as tarzan and jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen br br after the original film we begin to see how tarzan and jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other jane's skimpy jungle wear and tarzan's protest when jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically but also quite sexually in love br br one's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between tarzan jane to portray how much jane is actually teaching tarzan about love emotionally romantically and sexually and jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality br br the skin show in this film is off the charts in addition to jane's two piece sexy midriff leg and hip baring costume she also has an underwater nude swim with tarzan although it is not o'sullivan but olympic swimmer josephine mckim who doubles for her in this scene weissmuller also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth the ladies will delight when weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips br br it's a shame that the over protective censors toned down the adult nature of the tarzan films after this entry although the weissmuller tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie,1
i first saw this movie at a festival there were many good movies but few kept me thinking about it long after and an insomniac's nightmare was definitely one of them tess is definitely a gifted filmmaker the shots were great casting was perfect dominic shined in his role that she perfectly crafted there wasn't a lot to know about his character but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him and ellen i can't wait to see where she ends up she's showing a lot of talent and i hope she does a few more films with all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill tess shows that it's all not needing as long as there is a good story and actors kudos to everyone involved with this film and thanks to tess and co for distributing it on dvd,1
i saw the movie recently during the boston film festival the movie was very entertaining and is something that i believe the world and black america is ready to see it has comedy drama the soundtrack is great it is an all around good film the characters were well developed and the movie had a wide variety of prominent actors such as wood harris remember the titains paid in full brian j white trois 3 mr 3000 and the wonderful zoe saldana drumline pirates of the caribbean the movie tackles many relevant topics in todays society in a short period of time and does so with class and grace this is not only a story about life in the hospital however it is a story about people and their personal journey to discovering who they are or who they are going to be,1
i remember watching american gothic when it first aired it came into my mind recently all i could remember was the same guy appeared in midnight caller which is gary cole i don't watch much tv but i watched american gothic i purchased the complete series on dvd this week it's still as good as ever this is one of the best tv series ever the reason i don't watch much tv is because it's just rubbish that's on except for derren brown it's all reality tv or soaps such as grease big brother etc i'm fed up with it i got the complete series of american gothic for £16 97 form the asda website that's the cheapest i can find it,1
you've got to admire director todd sheets for his dedication drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie making between 1985 and 2000 he made a whopping 34 films unfortunately if his zombie bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by they're probably all crap and a quick look at their imdb ratings seems to verify my hunch br br part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead who have escaped from a top secret army base located directly beneath their school working from a dreadful script by brian eklund which relies heavily on liberal use of the f bomb director sheets delivers yet another embarrassingly amateurish effort featuring some mind numbingly awful performances from his talent free cast dreadful visual effects some crap cgi and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard space shuttle and his trademark shoddy gore handfuls of offal pulled from beneath his victims' clothing br br finally after what seems like an eternity watching irritating characters running for their lives and unconvincing undead people fondling animal innards zombie armageddon finishes with a time travel paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re watch several torturous minutes from the beginning of the film honestly once was enough mr sheetswhat have we done to deserve having to watch it again,0

star trek hidden frontier is a long running internet only fan film done completely for the love of the series and a must watch for fans of trek the production quality is extremely high for a fan film although sometimes you can tell that they're green screenin' it this doesn't take away from the overall experience however the cgi ships are fantastic as well as the space battle scenes on the negative side i could tell in the earlier episodes and even occasionally in the newer ones that some of the actors actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles but once again this doesn't take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of star trek the cast and crew have truly come up with something special here and as a whole i would highly recommend this series to fans of the next generation and deep space 9,1
manipulative drama about a glamorous model margaux hemingway who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician chris sarandon – to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister played by real life sibling mariel whose music teacher he is while the central courtroom action holds the attention – thanks largely to a commanding performance by anne bancroft as hemingway’s lawyer – the film is too often merely glossy but also dramatically unconvincing the jury ostensibly takes the musician’s side because a the girl invited assault due to the sensuous nature of her profession and b she was offering no resistance to her presumed aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together what the f she was clearly tied up – what resistance could she realistically offer br br the second half of the film – involving sarandon’s rape of the sister which curiously anticipates irreversible 2002 by occurring in a tunnel – is rather contrived mariel’s character should have known better than to trust sarandon after what he did to her sister but margaux herself foolishly reprises the line of work which had indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately the climax – in which sarandon gets his just desserts with margaux turning suddenly into a fearless and resourceful vigilante – is however a crowd pleaser in the style of death wish 1974 incidentally ubiquitous italian movie mogul dino de laurentiis was behind both films br br it’s worth noting how the two hemingway sisters’ lives took wildly different turns this was the film debut of both margaux’s career never took off despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here – while mariel would soon receive an oscar nomination for woody allen’s manhattan 1979 and interestingly would herself play a glamorous victim of raging violence when essaying the role of real life “playboy” centerfold dorothy stratten in bob fosse’s star 80 1983 with the added pressure of a couple of failed marriages margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug overdose in 1996 chillingly the hemingway family had a history of suicides – notably the sisters’ grandfather celebrated author ernest who died of a self inflicted gunshot wound in 1961,0
david beckham is a british soccer star and the husband of victoria beckham posh spice of the spice girls his trademark is a goal shot that curves across the pitch and into the net the soccer equivalent of an unhittable curve ball in baseball bend it like beckham means making that type of spectacular shot apart from that and a little shrine to him in the main character's bedroom and a faux cameo at the very end the movie has nothing to do with him br br the movie is full of little soccer in jokes such as the present that one of the characters' parents give her of a jersey with the number 9 on it property of the great mia hamm to those in the know references to posh 'n' becks the video homage to the wusa one of the characters plays for a disbelieving friend they have that lesbian gags sports bra gags and so on br br the story is about a teenage girl in england who idolizes beckham and wants to be a soccer star she has a real gift but the two seemingly insurmountable obstacles she must overcome are the absence of a professional women's league in the uk hence their fascination with our wusa and her parents who are indian immigrants set in very old fashioned ways that do not allow daughters among other things to engage in contact sports the girl's family are portrayed as figures of ironic fun but with great affection think my big fat greek wedding the girl loves and respects them enough to go through sitcom hell to conceal her growing soccer stardom from them,1
to borrow from dorothy parker this is not a film to be tossed aside br br lightly it should be thrown with great force br br this is an excruciating mess and i'm a greenaway fan br br mind numbingly awful br br the mummy returns has much more artistic merit,0
listening to the director's commentary confirmed what i had suspected whilst watching the film this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play at making a movie the plot is the kind of thing that deluded teenagers churn out when they're going through that i could write a book screenplay award winning sitcom phase there's a germ of an interesting idea buried in there probably because its a sequel to some one else's movie but it is totally buried under an underwritten badly executed and laughably un thought out script br br the lines are dire and the performances are un engaging though again i'm inclined to blame the director he does not appear to have consulted the actors at all about what is required rather plonked the script in their hands pointed the camera at them and told them to get on with it who knows with a little coaching these actors could have acquitted themselves better say what you like about musicians in movies jon bon jovi was excellent in row your boat and more than acceptable in the leading man br br as it stands the cast have no chemistry whatsoever a beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism parallel is passed up when in order to infect bon jovi's character with vampire blood from his ailing co hunter he is given a transfusion she should have bitten him mind you they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too the only real moment of sexual tension between the two female leads is by the directors own admittance accidental he had originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more pointless plot exposition so i suppose the finished product could have conceivably been worse but not a lot br br frankly as movies go this is badly plotted silly and forgettable even as trashy movies go it's not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining it could have been a fun and bloody little romp but the director has left with more of a comedy for all the wrong reasons,0
though cher and cage are the focal points of this story gardenia and dukakis are good counterparts for them this is where loretta and ronny will be in 50 years still in love the whole cast does a nice job from aiello to john mahoney it shows a real slice of life though i saw this long ago i am glad it finally catapulted cage to the place where he was recognized in hollywood for his talent from the music to the scenes at the opera to the kitchen table arguments this is a very entertaining movie,1
everyone should totally see this movie it's freaking scary but doesn't resort to lame jump out at you just to surprise you and pass it off as scary things it really is great see this freaking awesome movie the director is stanley kubrick easily the greatest director who ever lived every single one of his movies are masterpieces including this one the shining is about this family that goes to a hotel in the colorado rockies as caretakers for the winters and get snowed in well the house is haunted the kid is psychic the husband is easily impacted by evil haunted hotels and well hilarity ensues not really it becomes this gripping thriller where stuff gets thrown at the viewer from all different directions and it gets scary not just the classic here's johnny scene it's memorable but can't speak for the whole movies it's one of those things where words don't explain it adequately and you just gotta see it so go on netflix and get it geeeeeetttttttt itttttttt,1
this low budget digital video film has strengths in the right places writing and acting in addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far in low light conditions the characteristic video umber tone prevails but surprising it rivals film stock for brightness clarity and saturation in brightly lit situations this is grass roots film making at its best with snappy dialogue carrying a midnight cowboy kind of story about grifters doing whatever it takes to survive in urban san francisco,1
very light spoilers maybe br br normally a fan of diane keaton i tried to watch this tonight i had to switch it off before the second hour because i found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother both came across as self absorbed with little regard for others with the daughter also adding in rude disrespectful and reckless to the mix when the daughter died the only thing i thought was at least we won't have to watch her anymore keaton did a good job of moving into her stunned state and into the grieving but it was too far gone for me by then i simply wasn't enjoying it so i stopped watching if you want me to care for the protagonist you need to get me caring about the characters much sooner if it's nearly an hour in and i don't care it's too late br br the supporting cast was sincere and well played i felt for them and the gay best friend was wonderful but even combined that wasn't enough to carry the film for me,0

best animated movie ever made this film explores not only the vast world of modern animation with absolutely boggling effects but the branches of the human mind soul and philosophy the story features a family of cats where in the big sister dies the younger brother sees this and rescues her body but when she awakens she is left without a soul so the two sibling cats embark on a journey to find it i have related this journey to many things the history of the world the bible the cycle of life and every time i watch it i discover more and more hidden themes and metaphors if you aren't so into the physiological aspect of it then you will still adore it the animation is superb and the creative scenes will have you attached to the screen for example the ocean freezing in time god eating soup out of the earth a strange and slightly snm retelling of hansel and gretel to conclude cat soup is an absolute treat for anyone br br ps not for kids gratuitous violence included,1
going into this movie you know that this is movie has six lab technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac so right away you're guessing who will live and who will die the survivors end up being exactly who you'd expect them to be so no points for plot twists there br br and if you're not sure if this is a b movie or a movie that just happens to take place in a lab with an engaging story william devane plays a part instant b movie status br br the movie is promising in the beginning at the lab we are introduced to the invisible gorilla who is becoming increasingly violent oooh foreboding the best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again great special effects same thing when they make bacon invisible br br there are a couple of bare breasts a really lame dirty joke and enough out of place swearing to give this movie an r rating that it really didn't need br br for a thriller there weren't really any surprises except when shue makes like macgyver in the freezer which is more of a 'whaaaa ' ok there is one surprise that's when caine bacon comes back one last time in the elevator shaft it was a surprise but only because you're yelling at tv 'noooo you're dead already end the movie ' speaking of yelling at the tv that's all i did for the last 25 minutes or so 'put on your f ing goggles ' instead of putting their infrared goggles on so that they can see him they try every other trick in the book fire extinguishers sprinkler systems br br the story really lost it at the end but the special effects were good that's the only reason i give it a 2 10,0
this has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen the giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre this unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story the casts is outstanding including tom bosley who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before ever the effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one my one complaint i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy but other then that i think they did a great job the dialog the characters and the story was perfect the acting was wonderful this has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci fi channel you heard me the best movie to come out of the sci fi channel i give the fallen ones 9 out of 10,1
batman mystery of the batwoman is the latest animated batman straight to video dvd movie to be released minor spoilers ahead the plot revolves around a new crimefighter the batwoman who seems to be personally involved for whatever reason in stopping a major arms shipment br br although the movie is interesting enough it's not as good as 'mask of the phantasm ' 'sub zero ' or 'return of the joker ' the main reason being is that it doesn't give off the emotional appeal the other movies did at the end of this movie we don't really feel sorry for anyone as we did in the others especially 'sub zero ' there is no real tragedy that made the other animated movies special for us even the batwoman is not really a 'tragic' character as mr freeze or phantasm were not only that but batwoman's alter ego seems so incredibly 'stiff' and dull that the viewer doesn't really care what happened to her that caused her to put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and therein lies the main reason we don't get this special emotional appeal br br don't get me wrong i did find the movie enjoyable it does have its moments such as when the audience finds out who batwoman really is and seeing an old villain return who was last seen in the original 'batman the animated series ' the action is also very enjoyable with some very suspenseful moments br br if the batwoman's background was more interesting this movie would have been better than 'return of the joker' in my book but as it is now it's in 4th out of 4 br br as for the animation it's the same as the new batman adventures' cartoon from the mid to late 1990's the score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated batman films but it's still good nonetheless br br i do recommend buying this dvd because despite its flaws it is enjoyable but just remember it's not as good as the other batman animated movies br br 7 10,1
as i watched this movie and i began to see its' characters develop i could feel this would be an excellent picture when you get that feeling and the movie indeed fills those expectations the experience is rare i had that very feeling throughout this movie robert deniro and cuba gooding junior played riveting and amazingly strong parts which were both oscar worthy the supporting cast was equally as strong creating a winning foundation for the picture to grow on i can say without any hesitation at all see this movie it will not disappoint,1
an excellent movie superb acting by mary alice phillip m thomas and a young irene cara tony king was very realistic in his role of satin this movie was one of the last predominately all black movies of the 70's and unlike the blaxploitation movies of that era this movie actually had a plot and was very well done the movie soundtrack sung by aretha franklin was popular on the r b charts at the time,1
besides all of the technical mistakes br br how about a female flight attendant who's able to kill all by herself 4 out of the 7 terrorists including ex marines 2 of whom without even using a gun then she lands the plane perfectly we're not talking about sigourney weaver or linda hamilton we're talking about a regular frightened yet very well composed flight attendant d how about the leader in charge of the assault rescue squad having a full proof according to the logic of the script plan of sleep gassing everyone and having someone from his team fly the plane only he decides at the spur of the moment to change plans and instead lead an attack on the terrorists guns blazing not knowing where the terrorists are or how many and not securing a position of advantage so that his whole team gets easily wiped out yeah that's using the old noggin only later to decide to use the sleep gas anyway and it turns out useless for all intensive purposes br br bad as this movie was though i couldn't stop myself from watching and wondering what next d i can't help but imagine all the excellent unemployed script writers thinking to themselves it's not fair lol d,0
a case of being in the right place at the right time what a fascinating film it is easy to see why chavez is so popular with his people he gets things done he is accessible and it is also easy to see why the west hates him so much he has control of the resources of his country and gives the profits back to the people mostly the poor and it easy to see how the tv stations can portray misleading images to put there case just like the iraq war or the war on terror or those missing wmd's or how about the axis of evil people need to wake up and get different points of view stop the neo cons ruling the world go watch this movie with an open mind and make your own mind up then i suggest you see aaron russo's america freedom to fascism it is not the people of america that are the problem it is the government,1

when will i ever learn the ecstatic reviewer on npr made me think this turkey was another citizen kane please allow me to vent my spleen br br i will admit the setting presumably new york city has never been so downright ugly and unappealing i am reminded that the 70's was a bad decade for men's fashion and automobiles and all the smoking if the plan was to cheapen the characters it succeeded br br for a film to work at least in my simple estimation there has to be at least one sympathetic character only ned beaty came close and i could not wait for him to finish off nicky if a stray shot had struck mikey well it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the most br br i can't remember when i detested a film as strongly i suppose i'm a rube who doesn't dig art flicks oh well,0
the golden child was eddie murphy's first film since his megahit beverly hills cop and even though it's not as good as cop it's a fun comic adventure murphy stars as a finder of lost children who's assigned a most unusual case his assignment to find the title character a child with mystical powers this movie could have been titled beverly hills cop and the temple of doom since parts of this movie plays like a spielbergian adventure kinda like an indiana jones comedy it's got comedy with laughs and adventure with special effects lots of fun br br out of four,1
spacecamp is my favorite movie it is a great story and also inspires others br br the acting was excellent and my wife and i went to see lea thompson in cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie it is unfortunate that the challenger accident delayed and hurt the movie br br the 20th anniversary of the challenger accident is coming up i knew one of the challenger astronauts off and on since childhood on the carnegie mellon campus where my father went to school i also know a close friend of the late pilot br br i was the technical review last year for national bsa for the boy scout astronomy merit badge and i still find spacecamp a great movie to recommend to scouts doing the space related merit badges i teach br br i ran into the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of engineering education we had put together when challenger blew up i wound up sitting in with willard rockwell and his engineers invisible going over things after the accident at the astrotech stockholders meeting by chance as a result so i'm much closer to the accident and any movie similarities i made sure that i was a good student and finished the degree four years later strangely enough on the recommendation of the rockwell engineer who told them not to fly challenger in 1986 and who later built endeavour,1
reese witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one she appears like a fresh scrubbed face tween slight and stringy but undeniably reese br br i have always liked her as an actor and had no idea she started this young with her career go figure i actually gained some respect for reese to know who she was so early on i say that because whenever i have watched her perform the characters thus far in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character quite nicely in fact br br anyway my first film experience with reese was the little red riding hood parody reese did with kiefer sutherland somehow i assumed that was her first time up at bat not so well done reese,1
spirit stallion of the cimarron is an overall wonderful movie the blending of animation types is unique the storyline is amazing and the music is wonderful br br the drawn animation is a special thing about many animations how they expressed the characters especially the horses through their animation are spectacular especially while the way horses communicate through body language is easy to understand many young children and people who haven't studied horses might not understand without words i would imagine it would have to be challenging to express them through the features because of this i understand the 'eyebrow' they added to the horses while real horses don't have those thick lines one of the few things i noticed about horse habits that might have been portrayed strangely is that spirit lead his mother's herd in wild horse herds the lead stallion usually chases the young colts out br br also while some people might think portraying the white army officers as the 'bad guys' is stereotyping think of all the movies in which the native americans have been portrayed as that sometimes back then they did treat mustangs very poorly for example in real history the appaloosa breed was almost wiped out due to the army officers imagine what would have happened to one of the worlds best loved riding breeds if the native americans had not saved them br br i think it's amazing how the realism wasn't subtracted by making the horses talk to each other spirit's feelings were expressed by a little bit of narration but mostly through the music by bryan adams the songs express the story really well and hans zimmer and bryan adams did a great job telling the story through melodies and lyrics br br the emotion i got when watching the movie whether the first time or the twentieth yes i've watched it that much you wouldn't believe some of the scenes take your breath away while others seem to force tears into your eyes the opening sequence showing spirit's homeland puts you right into the spectacular action right away br br i don't understand at all why some people are so hateful of this brilliant movie overall i rate it a 10 10 a must watch,1
young mr lincoln is a poetic beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most revered figures in american history henry fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time make him human enough for people to care about it is perhaps the actors best performance watch how he singlehandedly stops a lynching mob alice brady is fantastic in the role of a simple farmer woman most of the last part of the film plays out in a courtroom and there lies the only negative thing i can say about this movie most of the characters from judge to spectators are given so many folksy humorously lines that distracts from the serious trial that is on hand but i'm quite used to this because the humor is a ford trademark supporting parts by ward bond and donald meek are very good,1
always enjoy great films which deal with the super natural and the deep thoughts of the spiritual world however this film just turned me off as far as its production and direction there is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story has to tell all i can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen the actors namely mark addy thomas garrett gave an outstanding performance in his native land england and we have seen him in still standing a tv series heath ledger played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in brokeback mountain '05 gave a great supporting role shannyn sossaman mara sinclair did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith don't waste your time you will be sorry,0
i watched this movie a couple of days ago in a small independent cinema in paris it was my last evening in the french capital and the best good bye i could have chosen these twenty episodes made me relive the impressions i had collected in paris in a heart warming manner without drifting off into kitsch or sentimental schmaltz each episode is full of surprise strong emotions and suggestive pictures and each short film is directed according to the rules of a good short story to me this kind of movie demands a lot more talent and qualities of a director and a story board writer than any epic two hours drama and all of them succeeded in their task excellently the stories were chosen carefully with regard to their matching arrondissement and express the respective flair perfectly each episode was seen from a different ankle had a different topic a different style and still the twenty stories result in a harmonic orchestra of films the most outstanding advantage with the concept of an episode movie in my opinion is based in the fact that you can switch in between a large variety of feelings and moods without the danger of overload just the other way round the melange of sadness melancholy pure joy despair wrath anxiety curiosity or passion gives this movie a unique freshness and harmony and not to forget the all over topic of love love between the characters love between the characters and paris and also the love of the directors and actors actresses for this project i don't want to go into the details of the episodes since there are so many but i must highlight the range of world famous actors and actresses from all over the world and their approach to this project some played with their image some broke it completely and some interpreted the stereotypes connected with their home country or the roles they had played before so intertextuality was given all through the movie all in all i can absolutely recommend this great collage and will be looking forward to its release on dvd,1
distortion is a movie that sort of caught me by surprise a sort of multi layered drama that focuses on a man writing a play about his life experiences that are happening to him right at this moment to be more concise he feels that his wife is cheating on him so he hires a private eye to snoop on him his wife has no idea that this is happening meanwhile the actors in this play are also having a few whoopdedoodles up their sleeves by fooling around with each other and with shall we say unscrupulous people in the world of israel the whole thing culminates in a theater with all the actors present and the predictable but not really happens br br the director of the piece really keeps things moving along with the ensemble cast of characters and edits in a way that makes you pay attention this is a fun film actually one which i didn't mind viewing and would recommend people check out,1
this movie basks too much in its own innocence it doesn't tell a story it's more a big time snooze fest while the actors are all personable the story is so trite and goes nowhere i think victor rasuk has great charisma but deserves a real film from a real storyteller,0
lost is one of a kind its so enchanting and full of suspense thrill and emotions all at the same time i have never seen any tv series like this before it is full of jungle thrills and has a good screenplay the actors have emoted life on an island in such a natural way that i feel lost in the island myself while watching it it is an excellent piece of work narrated in a very intelligent form the series is like a movie depicting the life of the survivors lost on a deserted island i am tempted to watch one episode after the other and i highly recommend this series for all the tv show lovers watch it to see the magic of being lost in nowhere,1
''the sentinel'' is one of the best horror movies already made in the movie's industry i think it is very scary as very few movies actually are alison parker is a model with some fame she dates a lawyer called michael lerman and has as a best friend another model called jennifer everything was great in her life until she decides to live alone for some time and rents a beautiful and old apartment br br the problem are her neighbors who are very very strange suddenly alison starts to have health problems and faints with frequency she also remembers some painful facts about her past that makes her have nightmares or illusions but everything has a reason and it has to do with the new house she is living br br i personally find ''the sentinel'' a very creepy movie and along with ''the exorcist'' they are two of the scariest movies i already watched when we discover that alison's house is only occupied by the priest and herself my blood froze it's also horrible to see that she needs to become blind in the end of the movie in order to be the new sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world,1
the dubbing translation in this movie is downright hilarious and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise dull and derivative zombie flick i haven't laughed so hard in my life as i just did watching zombi 3 and i've seen some really bad dubbing in my life believe me seriously the filmmakers could re edit this movie and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars it's just that funny br br but if falling off your couch laughing at the dubbing in a fulci zombie movie isn't your cup of tea then avoid this at all costs,0
i saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was well that was because it isn't supposed to be taken so seriously basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job there seems to be another movie coming out like that too umm scary movie well this is aussie and original jessica napier does a surperb performance and sarah kants has a definate bright future in acting i hope to see more of them molly ringwald was a good move and kylie was an even better move the impossible princess was queen of the screen i recommend seeing this flick as you'll be guessing until the very end the connection with raffy hilary and the movie that never got finished 20 years ago,1
the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that luhzin lives his life as a chess game so many people have seen this film and just don't get it and i don't understand why while watching this film i was taken on a private journey which floored me i will try to explain this without any spoilers but be forewarned i do talk about things that happen in the movie br br possible spoilers be forewarned br br his is a life of large moves versus small moves he chooses natalia to be his queen and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy listen closely to that description br br when someone asks him a question he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves the flashbacks are beautifully lit by the way the flashbacks are quite interesting as well for they give not only his point of view as a child but the point of view of the other character as well it's stunning br br various characters become either his helpers or his enemies pawns bishops and knights their actions enlightening you as to who's side they are on even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on beautifully done br br i will not comment more on what happens to the character of luhzin but i hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the end br br this film is constantly working on many levels which is why i endorse it it was a treat and a joy to watch br br if you like this film i would recommend a film called fresh the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as pieces br br,1
being a huge fan of the japanese singers gackt and hyde i was terribly excited when i found out that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life to see it i was not disappointed in fact this film greatly exceeded my expectations knowing that both gackt and hyde are singers rather than actors i was prepared for brave yet not really that fulfilling performances but am delighted to say that both of them managed to keep me captivated and believing the story as it went on moon child has just the right amount of humour action romance and serious heart wrenching moments i can't say that i've ever cried more at a film and these more tender moments are admirably acted by the pair in my opinion definitely proving their skills as actors the fight scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with you are quick to get into the movie and begin to bond with the characters i thoroughly recommend this film to anyone especially those who are fans of gackt and hyde,1
no one better spoil this piece of work awesome movie written expertly by the likes of ira levin and depicted with the best performance of christopher reeve's career and one of caine's very best this is simply excellent i wish i could catch a staged version somewhere maybe someday i will i hope this grossly underrated overlooked film has not become too difficult to locate because it a 'must' for any hitchcockian agatha phile or lover of great film one of very few movies i couldn't instantly solve or predict and worth a second or even third viewing deathtrap gets a 9 10 and earns every iota of it we need and deserve more movies like this,1
well i have to say that i have waited for it to come br br i won't try to spoil it and quite a few people have really brilliantly spoken of the pilot on the other hand i'm not quite sure to understand the detractors who claim themselves to be bsg fans and not like the pilot br br what the frack did they expect the background is setting 50 years before bsg we are there o assist at the birth of the cylons see the life of the adama family has we already knew some of it from bsg get a deeper explanation of the caprican population and its perception of the other colonies and potentially the origins of the gods belief of the human and the unique god belief of the cylons br br i do not expect the same profusion of special effect or space opera as the in the previous series i make the difference between the two although i know that caprica will reinforce bsg br br this is 1h30 of promising start i believe as well that this will put pressure for the scenarios to be as good as bsg i expect a lot from the following but i have no reasons to doubts that we will learn a lot more br br watching the dvd's deleted scene also gives more material for your brain to chew on br br looking forward to january 2010,1
put a dvd of this flick in a time capsule and it will definitely illustrate for future generations a perfect example of one which warrants the minimal rating on a 1 to 10 star scale br br bill cosby and ray romano have been at the top in ratings and with tens of millions in earnings annually with their television series' yet each has had no success in big screen offerings this has also been true for other tv personalities perhaps because many of the stories which are presented for two hours or so seem more suited to either a 10 minute skit or at most the 22 or 23 minutes of drama during a half hour program br br this film however doesn't have one single element which would warrant two or three minutes of time on mad tv snl or anywhere else on a screen or stage br br its origination date is listed as 2002 but release date to dvd only is shown as 2004 it also was filmed not long before rodney dangerfield's death so its one redeeming value is that it probably provided at lease a few hundred thousand more dollars for his heirs br br i'd never heard of it but found it when turning on my set and frankly became fascinated by it some movies are so truly awful that they rate a sort of top rating in reverse so bad that you can move the dial backwards to a 9 or 10 plan 9 from outer space is the best example and the bruce jenner village people opus can't stop the music is another br br unfortunately this flick falls short even there even if rodney's earlier work as well as some of his fellow cast members' fell short of citizen kane or casablanca there were many moments of humor and a story providing at least a modicum of interest br br unfortunately this presentation doesn't seem to possess even a minute or two's worth of such material,0
i did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the tmnt to be four brothers with their teacher splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like leonardo michelangleo raphel and donatello so venus here doesn't have any meaning or playing any important part and i believe that the old tmnt series was much more better than that new one which contains venus as a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the tmnt we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action we wish to see more new of tmnt series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle,0
what do you expect when there is no script to begin with and therefore nothing that the director can work with hayek and farrell and donaldson and kirkin are good actors they just don't have anything to say or anything to react to even the earthquake was pretty poor and i don't know how closely the movie follows the novel but two have the jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show that arturo has a nice warm heart but some stereotypes don't amount to anything and he even buries camilla out in the desert instead of bringing her back to l a for a nice catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while pathetic and the l a set was ridiculously graphically created anything good the window to his apartment felt real the curtains the sounds the wind and donaldson is always great has been since the body snatchers or night of the living dead whichever it was,0
having read some of the other comments here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised reality check the original series wasn't that good i think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and daisy duke's legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted the duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks the shrunken boss hog was too cretinous to be evil and rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment it's amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series br br back to the movie if you watch this film in it's own right not as a direct comparison to however you remember the tv series then it's not bad at all the real star is of course the general lee the car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what d o h is all about johnny knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with seann william scott as cousin bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious dumb and dumber sort of way the tv series never achieved the lovely jessica simpson is a natch as miss daisy burt reynolds makes a much improved boss hog and m c gainey makes a believably nasty rosco p coltrane the way he always should have been br br if you don't like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldn't be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect otherwise if you want an entertaining car action movie with a few good laughs that's not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind,1
val kilmer love or loath him sometimes he gets under the skin of a character and pulls out a performance that makes you go 'hey this guy is a great actor ' he did in the leather pants of jim in the doors and he's done it again in the leather underpants of john br br revolving around the fall and fall of uber porn king john holmes kilmer strutts to his knees as we unravel one of the biggest murder mysteries hollywood has never solved for over twenty years with holmes the key suspect to a brutal manson style slaughter br br what kilmer does so effortlessly is exhude the low life of the celebrity the do anything to anyone craving that overwhelms anyone who had it and then lost it go see him you'll know what i mean,1
alexandr sascha luzhin john turturro is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an italy hosted tournament his brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life natalia emily watson is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother vera geraldine james to scope out possible marriage partners vera leans toward a handsome count but astonishingly natalia is more fascinated by sascha whom she met on a walk sascha too is taken with natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting but with the concentration that sascha must give to the chess matches and with other happenings in his past still causing problems will he win the heart of natalia oh and can he become the chess champion also this is a lovely film based on a novel by nabokov the acting is amazing with watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and turturro utter perfection as the shy awkward chess enthusiast james gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well as for the look of the film it could not be better the scenery is of the put your eye out variety the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause yes the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks at times making it a film not everyone will appreciate then too the ending is bittersweet however if you love romance period pieces great acting knockout scenery or the fine art of motion picture creation don't miss this one you will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms,1
what another reviewer called lack of character development i call understatement the movie didn't bash one over the head with overexplanation or unnecessary backstory yes there were many untold stories that we only got a glimpse of but this was primarily a one day snapshot into an event that catalyzed change in all of the characters' lives henry thomas's performance was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action good rental,1
i first see this film almost 21 years ago when it was an itv before the days of cable and satellite matinée i was off school with the mumps and i was totally wrapped in the film i have had it on bought video for about 10 years and i want to obtain a dvd copy of it david niven is my all time favourite actor and i think it is a travesty that he was over looked so many times when the oscars came around i also think that the queen should have knighted him as he easily did as much for the movie industry if not more than sean connery or anthony hopkins the way the film switches from black and white to colour and back again is well done and the film has such stellar actors as roger livesy marius goring and an early appearance from richard attenborough,1
i just watched this film 15 minutes ago and i still have no idea what i just watched mainly i think it's a film about an internet s m star of cd roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online she's murdered by someone which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 fbi agents to investigate the death the local homicide division of big city usa is also investigating though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the cd roms which he claims are as realistic as the real thing i know wow br br michael madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him he's in the film for about 15 minutes and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason i won't even explain the ending because quite frankly i can't make it out myself but before the final scene we're treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film honestly they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all br br all in all stay away from this film i got it because i love bad movies and i love michael madsen i really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied like playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly that for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining,0
the movie was very sweet and heartwarming i cry almost every time i watch the movie i would recommend this movie for every one the movie was so inspiring to me the actors did a great job of acting and the movie was very well played and done the movie was about a little girl who owned a parrot of whom she named paulie paulie had gotten separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for her br br after paulie had experienced so many people he ended up in a cage by himself in a basement finally this russian man who had gotten a job at a place as a janitor had found paulie in the basement and paulie began to talk to him telling him the story of his life in the end the man helped paulie reunite with marie the little girl who raised paulie love overcame all the obstacles,1
the cover on the dvd and disc is freaking awesome you would think they made a movie about sweet tooth from twisted metal black which is still a really great idea but this movie's actors are worst then ben's performance in pearl harbor porno's have better quality and better actors i was gonna buy the dvd but luckily i rented it first the plot and script are also horrible nothing seems to go to together so the movie really never makes sense the poor attempts to frighten you using flashback scenes are worse then ones used in 80's sitcom shows and in the end it'll leave you wanting to bang your head against the wall of your house,0
as we all know hollywood enjoys changing historical events around for our enjoyment and 44 minutes is one of those hollywoodized movies for example the bank robbers never did go back in the bank when they started shooting at the lapd yet in the movie we see them go back inside twice another example is the number of lapd officers who were shot near the end of the movie this is far from the truth but of course hollywood must have a good bloody ending so they add some more blood and guts some events were combined and many of the lead actors played several different people but this is what hollywood has always done so why complain i guess the only sad part is that i have watched some one hour documentaries about the north hollywood shootout on tlc that were far better then this,0
i saw this when on the wonderful world of disney as a kid so i didn't recall much of it as i watched it recently i sat there thinking this is the weirdest thing i've seen br br the 'traveling' scenes look like something caused by an lsd overdose the animated characters are mostly oddly colored voiced versions of jungle book and robin hood characters some not so disney things i noticed kids being threatened at knife point and prostitutes during the portobello road song br br it was very entertaining though the musical numbers were long and i can see little kids getting bored with them also the subject manner was a bit dark seeing as it was set during ww2,1
to die for 1989 was just another d t v feature that made an appearance on cable ad nasuem during the early nineties the only thing notable about this feature was the last movie duane jones appeared in other than that there's no reason to watch this vampire flick unless you like pseudo chick flicks masquerading as a horror film a tired vampire longs for love and searches the back streets of l a looking for it will he succeed or will vlad just strike out again like he has for the last century br br this movie must have been big because a couple of sequels soon followed they're so bad they make this one look like a classic i know this is a movie about vampires but the film makers could have used to lighting br br not recommended by me because i didn't like it br br 'nuff said,0
this is a haunting powerful italian adaptation of james m cain's novel the postman always rings twice directed by the great luchino visconti what is so interesting about the film is that in every way it transcends it's source material to become something bolder and more original interestingly camus also credits cain's novel as the key inspiration for his landmark novel the stranger the film has a greater power and intensity than the novel because visconti is able to create the filmic equivalent of cain's narrative structure but offer a more complex exploration of gender cain's very american novel is also uncritically fascinated with the construction of whiteness the lead character cora is obsessively afraid she will be identified as a mexican and embarrassed that she married a greek immigrant which is not relevant to the italian rural context that visconti is working in this allows the class antagonisms to take center stage and dance among the embers of the passionate doomed love affair of the two main characters this film is a complex suspenseful rewarding experience,1
there is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award well it does not deserve an audience as well ironically one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least every frame you feel you are getting the full picture its like someone is cropping your view from the edges the story is pathetic well i will be honest i could not bear to watch the entire movie the part that sucked the most was when i saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor these and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of steven seagal br br take my advice stay away from this piece of crap,0
i cant believe some people actually like this yet still call themselves batman fans even going as far as to say it's better than btas which it's not it should be plagiarism for them to use batman's name for this piece of crap it's not batman br br the whole premise of the show is ''if you cant defeat someone get a bigger weapon to help you'' batman isn't all about weapons he uses his batarang and grappling hook and batmobile thats it he doesn't come up with some new ingenious tech every time he cant beat someone i don't know where the hell they got the idea for a batbot or whatever they have ruined all the villains mr freeze has gone from a sympathetic scientist to a petty criminal who fell in some cryofreezing thing catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman with a dumb costume penguin is now a ninja with a 50 ft tall top hat the ventriloquist is now called scarface making the dummy the whole centerpiece for the character they even got a dumb idea to make him a giant wtf and the two worst character changes are that of the joker and riddler they have changed riddler to a gothic retro teenage freak and the joker to an acrobat with dreads he looks like a bob marley wannabe they have completely and utterly ruined batman even moreso than b r did i wish i could meet the creators and or writers and animators of this show so i could whack them in the head with a metal baseball bat,0
at first look of the plot tagline i figured it could have been a decent film could i have ever been more wrong the beginning of the film makes it look like a bunch of freaks got together and decided to make a low budget film for the first 10 minutes you don't notice the cheesy acting horrible sound and god awful special effects but then it gets worse just about 20 minutes into it i was asking myself what was the plot again i could only ask that question when i wasn't busted out laughing from the sheer lameness of this film the main actor has one setting for emotions and he sticks to it throughout the entire film even though he was supposed to go through love and hate and everything in between the flashback scene almost made me vomit because it made me re live one extra minute of footage from earlier in the movie now we hit the middle of the film where they are obviously trying to rip off morpheus from the matrix although he is doing just a horrible job the actor's talking about star wars and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable now at the end of the movie you don't realize that it's the end of the movie because you actually think the plot is finally developing the morpheus character dies the only good thing about the movie he utters a couple words and the credits roll what is this no plot bad acting cheesy everything it couldn't get any worse please if you value human decency do not watch this movie,0
i absolutely love all of tom robbins books so i was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of his books i knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of robbins' magic but after seeing the movie it made me never want to read the book again the movie even cowgirls get the blues doesn't include an eighth of the content in the book and it seems to focus more on the love connection between bonanza jellybean and sissy than anything else along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie i think that better actors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters the only actors in the movie that i thought played their roles fit to robbins' descriptions in the book were julian's friends in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie those who haven't read the book might enjoy the movie but as a huge tom robbins fan this movie was nothing but a disappointment,0
i usually like zombie movies but this one was just plain bad br br the good parts girl swimming topless with thong bottoms sonya salomaa's topless and ona grauer's boobs jiggling in a skimpy top when she ran br br the bad part too much video cuts too much matrix slow motion it drags the action not enough blood and guts bad acting and no story the only other person in the theater was smart and left right after the topless swimming scene a total waste of 6 and time i give it a 2 out of 10,0
rosenstrasse is more an intimate film than one of epic proportions which could have kept away many film goers looking for a pianist similar plot fortunately von trotta a good screenwriter opts for a feminist peep to an era too much illustrated on its colorful exterior but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the point of view of ordinary aryan german rather from a jewish standpoint rosentrasse finds its strength in these unsung burdens of people trapped within historical circumstances of which they emerge as victims the pace of the film is introspective poignantly slow meditative besides the characters are so vivid while transitions between generations and the passing of time has been deftly crafted rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece and some narrative flaws are well discerned another fault lies on a trivial cinematography unable to capture the intensity of the internal drama lived by the characters nevertheless this film is worth seeing finally rosenstrasse is part of the last trend in german films dealing with the ghosts of a nightmarish past trend that includes such excellent films as nowhere in africa and recently the controversial downfall i would recommend this film to those who know how to read beyond the images,1
1st watched 8 3 2003 2 out of 10 dir brad sykes mindless 3 d movie about flesh eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle and yes we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3d wow not that has been done time and time again in 2d in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh eating that's what made the original zombie classics good the flesh eating was just thrown in as an extra we're actually bored throughout most of this 3 part chronicle because of the lame twilight zone like easily understood and slow pacingly revealed finale's the last story is actually the story the movie started with having a reporter investigating a so called ghost town and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well well i think i've said enough watch the classics not this 3d bore feast,0
something i really love about this woman's short films was the elusiveness of theme especially in living with happiness this film has some nice beginnings unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment but fails to succeed with clunky expositional dialogue patchy performances and very television coverage br br it's once again charming television and very ordinary cinema the ideas are so fleshed out that they almost feel pat like a television commercial but the sentiment is good so we can't complain too much br br i really would love to see this director make a full length animation and try and work with a producer who doesn't demand so much boring clarity,0
i've only ever seen this film once before about ten years ago i bought the dvd two days ago and after watching it i think it is even better than i remembered it to be br br paperhouse is much more than just a horror it had such an amazing level of emotion and great characterisation running through it i especially thought charlotte burke was really excellent here it's such a pity that she hasn't done anything else as she was an excellent actress altogether her portrayal of emotion throughout the film was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across especially at the end when she realised that although marc had died she knew he was going to be alright br br several scenes did make me jump which is a rarity for me in modern horror films most notably the scene in the bathtub the scene where anna's father was chasing her with the weird radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke apart and crumbled to dust br br all in all an excellent and very moving film,1
this movie surprised me some things were clicheish and some technological elements reminded me of the movie enemy of the state starring will smith but for the most part very entertaining good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo providing some comic relief this is a movie you can watch over again say some wednesday night when nothing else is on i gave it a 9 for entertainment value,1
liked stanley iris very much acting was very good story had a unique and interesting arrangement the absence of violence and sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable movie,1
i watched this flick yesterday and i have to say it's the finest horror film made for 36 000 i've ever seen sorry steckler the film is definitely worth seeking out if you are a zombie fan this movie reeks of soul and atmosphere some of the shots of the zombs are the best ever committed to film very creepy looking dusty webbed corpses slowly shamble to their screaming victims brrrrrrr br br hot saggy canadian women with sexy accents will keep you preoccupied before the horror rears its undead corpse eating head this film entertained from start to finish i couldn't ask for more than that my only complaint is that is was too short,1
this is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life the pacing the camera work the emotion the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see it isn't easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted the only flaw i can see about this film is that it wasn't captured in a more technically perfect film format it deserved todd ao technicolor and the very finest sound format available an intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter the gorgeous italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard as it is it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film i can't stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite the transformations of the characters from contained tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and i really should recommend it more often br br the casting is perfect the mood is perfect the acting is above reproach it is a film about middle age and the choices people make it is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you if you don't get it perhaps you haven't lived enough or something else is wrong with you,1
the guy did a lot of title design for a bunch of movies and i guess one day he said i should pick a cheap scenario try to put as much title in it as a can cause after all i'm a title designer and try to persuade people that this is in fact a movie one of the worst i've even seen that's for sure if you fell the urge to see nice titles go check out some posters don't waste your time watching this br br it kinda ironic don't you think did you saw the poster the only part of his project that should had title work done have almost none,0
life hits us in the face we must try to stay beautiful br br debut movie from one of belgian's best artists he sings songs tom barman a long awaited movie and happy happy joy joy for flemish filmmaking really worth watching and a promising piece of work it takes us into the lifes of 8 main characters that live through a friday and night the title says a lot about the way we spend time with them we float as they do into friday night's party where they kinda' meet br br it's rhytmic style is very 'thought off' superb use of music it sometimes takes the upperhand to the images and then you feel its power gainsbourg qotsa the party scene 20minutes is a thrilling visual experience cause of the way that it's shot it keeps you really with it while it's set in a small place with a lot of people having a big party so hard to shoot br br thank you menijèr barman for making this daring movie in these already some years going poor times of flemish filmmaking you made my day,1
why every horror director wants to imitate the exorcist is a complete riddle to me as william friedkin's classic is a very overrated film and in my opinion not all that tense or shocking and yet here's another clean rip off a spanish one this time that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family paul naschy who i must admit looks quite hot here plays the honorable priest who gets approached by john gibson because his sister leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend at first the priest doesn't believe it but when john's body is discovered with its neck twisted leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable exorcism is not only very unoriginal it's also an insufferably boring film here naschy and director juan bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that'll nearly put you to sleep the last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments albeit very stupid and there's quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze the absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since paul naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money this is just an awful film end of story other european the excorcist rip offs are the antichrist and beyond the door and they suck as well,0
up until this new season i have been a big 'little mosque' fan however the new season had absolutely ruined it br br the new christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice the new vicar ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad light br br i am neither christian or muslim but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between amar and the reverend not any more br br just cancel it and be done with it it's not worth watching any more br br it might still be saved but a lot of change would need to be made br br bring back the old format,0
this could be a 10 if it wasn't for the quite predictable and hollywood ish scenario daniel day lewis confirms its position as one of the leading actors of our time why not the leading may i ask and the rest of the cast stand in a very high level i personally was impressed with hugh o' connor who played christy brown as a child the very first scene i watched him was really strong wow,1
this is a cleaver film featuring love through the ages the film consists of keaton seeking out a lady love in the stone age in ancient rome and in the present 1920s in all three cases he is the usual wimpy buster and he battles against wallace beery for his lady love of the three time periods i think i liked the roman one best even though i admit it might have also been the cheesiest i actually liked the scenes with the lion that was obviously a guy in a costume as well as the weird chariot race in the snow but what i really enjoyed the most was seeing all of keaton's amazing acrobatics however all three time periods were good old fashioned fun and the film while not his best is still an exceptional and enjoyable film check it out,1
the clouded yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations barry jones and kenneth more are both terrific in supporting roles in characters that both have more to them than what meets the eye jean simmons is quite good and trevor howard makes a fascinatingly offbeat suspense hero,1
i just loved watching it though and having fun with it's total badness of a film i saw this film through the helpful sarcasm of mystery science theater 3000 and i have the dvd if you flip the to the other side of the dvd they show the actual movie so i gave it a chance seriously folks this is grilled cheese br br the acting special effects and plot in general is very cheesy and unrealistic doesn't she need lungs said crow noticing how the head can still talk while it doesn't have a body and tom servo just wistfully remarks no she's got neck juice the ending is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with k porn i loved the cat fight between the two strippers that meow after the fight or scene whatever was classic so in some ways this was a fun movie i think for horror fans you'll probably enjoy it for a good time watch the mstk3 version you'll get a great laugh br br mst3k version 10 10 the brain that would die 1 10,0
what is it is a mish mash of bizarre recurring motifs snails shirley temple swastikas and overtly racist music among others unfettered by any sort of narrative or plot or character development the whole thing struck me as self consciously freak show and i don't mean only the unusual casting decisions it has the feel of a bad acid trip far beyond any level of drug use one might attribute to hunter s thompson or william s burroughs the only movie to which i can compare it is eraserhead my second least favorite film of all time which was by intent much more depressing but i still found what is it a total waste of my time it's one thing to give me a peek into the inner workings of someone else's mind even someone else's chemically altered consciousness but quite another to just throw weird visuals at me purely for the sake of weirdness,0
hollywood the home of hype glamor and the search for profits is scarcely ruled by spiritual values and so it comes as no surprise that its attempts at investigations of the spiritual life are thin and often silly better to go farther afield to the films of bresson dreyer rossellini and bergman for probing depictions of the spirituality strange cargo is no exception this odd hybrid of adventure film love story and religious parable trivializes the very insights it tries to communicate that a figure of providence and salvation would work to match verne clark gable at his most cockily mannered and self regarding and julie joan crawford snarling and spitting out every other word in an attempt to be the queen of tough dames seems ludicrous at best is this the patron saint of the star system at work matching warring egos before sending them off to further penal servitude on the m g m lot but there are good supporting performances here and visually arresting moments the shadowy prison barracks the escaping boat by moonlight or against a painterly cloudscape julie walking along the seafront as the wind whips up julie and monsieur pig peter lorre bargaining for verne's freedom as the storm builds an unusually ennobling gay prison romance between two convicts above all there is paul lukas's dignified and detached performance as hessler a murderer who can appreciate cambreau's virtues yet turns his back on him in the film's most arresting moment hessler having left cambreau stands outside the cabin we hear the wind through the jungle see the shadows on his face which conveys a moment of fear and self doubt then he exits into the night in this moment hessler achieves an ambiguity depth and existential strength that none of the other characters manage to achieve is the film's secret that its deepest sympathies are allied with hessler,0
this early role for barbara shelley in fact her first in britain after working in italy was made when she was 24 years old and it's certainly safe to say that she made a stunning debut in 1957's cat girl while blondes and brunettes get most of the attention i'll always cherish yutte stensgaard the lovely auburn haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerability one such example being 1960's village of the damned in which her screen time was much less than her character's husband george sanders she is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of cat people and is seen to great advantage throughout it's difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase her character apparently sleeps in the nude and we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakened also exposed 8 years later in 1965's rasputin the mad monk the ravishing gown she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonder i don't see what held that dress up but i'd sure like to all in all proof positive that barbara shelley in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses rises above her material and makes the film consistently watchable a real test of star power which she would find soon enough at hammer's studios in bray for the duration of the 1960's,0
i've loved all of cream's work even as there is such a small and precious catalog of work to take hold even when they go for as long as twenty minutes with some of their songs spoonful and toad off of wheels of fire are prime examples still rock the socks off of more than half of any given rock act working today this power to gel on stage is given one of the most anticipate rock band reunions ever with their royal albert hall shows last year they may have gotten older as have their fans but the energy is still there with the great arrangements of classic blues songs as well as their own the renditions of white room badge politician spoonful sunshine of your love not one seems to miss a beat clapton's solos have a formation that he sometimes doesn't have when on stage with his solo band ginger baker enough said jack bruce is sturdy enough with his vocals still with a kind of power that clapton could never get on his own bottom line if you want to see what were the best shows you wish you had seen last year well some may have seen them it's all on this dvd with cool special features,1
this ambitious film suffers most from writer director paul thomas anderson's delusions of grandeur highly derivative of much better material altman's nashville lumet's network this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere a couple of misguided detours along the way an embarrassing musical interlude a biblical plague don't help matters neither does the uneven level of performances especially bad william h macy whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether julianne moore for her unconvincing angst and how many times must we see john c reilly's sad sack shtick chicago and the hours will suffice tom cruise comes off well by comparison  his misogynist foul mouthed holy roller was rather amusing speaking of foul mouths the script was so loaded with f bombs they lost their impact in no time don't even talk about that awful soundtrack full of insipid and annoying vocals by aimee mann her extended rendition of one a maudlin number to begin with drove me to distraction at the start of the film i should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours by which time i'd been pushed to the brink of hell one redeeming feature which i haven't seen mentioned in other reviews is the best performance in the bunch by unknown melora walters in the role of claudia the damaged coke fiend bent on self destruction her credibility exceeded all others by far this film took itself way too seriously and just didn't know when to end,0
barman directed any way the wind blows as he would sing a deus song anarchy rules over a logical and common strain of thoughts the story behind this movie just goes any which way the wind blows and that can truly be refreshing to watch if you are prepared and willing that is viewers who state that there is nothing to keep the story lines together are right who the hell is that windman anyway still i really enjoyed this movie antwerp is a beautiful bustling happening place and any way captures that feeling it also captures the silliness the racism the bureaucracy the addictions and the violence that survives undetected in a seemingly friendly city the movie is entertaining funny and a little shallow barman's screen debut will not make as heavy an impact as his music debut in that light some might be disappointed but then again 'worst case scenario' would be a subtle subtitle for any way the wind blows,1

how can barry levinson possibly assemble white hot comedy talents ben stiller and jack black the gorgeous rachel weisz old pro christopher walken and still deliver such a humourless stinker br br stiller and black are friends until the latter invents a spray to make dog mess vanish and becomes a conspicuous consuming multi millionaire br br the premises is thin but sound enough in the right hands to have been a springboard for some great bitching between the two stars but all concerned overplay every hand every chance they can br br stiller and black are simply not funny for way too much of the time weisz looks sensational as always but is criminally underused and with the exception of walken as a batty barfly who urges stiller's character to take revenge it's a turgid trudge to the end of this strained farce,0

i sat with my children as we watched this film we all found it to be a very entertaining movie br br when billy goes to a new school a fifth grade bully starts stuff with him and this is what leads to the eating of worms br br a bet is made and billy has only so much time to eat 10 worms or else from this point the bully and his friends try to come up with nasty ways to cook fry or bake the worms to try and get billy sick so that he will lose the bet br br billy stays strong and eats his way into becoming liked more and more by everyone even the bullies friends br br i wont tell you if he wins the bet or not you will just need to watch it to find out but i will think that if you like good family movies you will like this one br br p s let me add that this movie is not just for boys i have all daughters and they really liked it a lot,1
something to sing about was produced at grand national studios where james cagney was working while under a contract dispute with the brothers warner he did two films for this b studio neither of which rank high in the cagney credits br br one of the great losses to cinema is the fact that jimmy cagney did so few films that utilized his terrific dancing abilities the two that come to mind immediately are yankee doodle dandy and footlight parade two lesser films are the west point story and never steal anything small cagney himself said he never used to watch anything but his musicals in retirement so why did he make so few of them br br well this one was all wrong the plot of something to sing about concerns a hoofer who fronts for a band who's discovered and given a movie contract there are the usual complications of a conniving studio boss and a conniving press agent played respectively and well by gene lockhart and william frawley his contract calls for a no marriage clause so cagney and band girl singer lady evelyn daw marry in secret then we get the complication of a publicity driven studio romance with screen leading lady mona barrie i think you can figure where this is going br br the most disappointing thing about something to sing about is the lack of dance numbers for cagney he dances briefly at the beginning and the end of the film and nothing in the middle evelyn daw had a nice singing voice and the charisma of a ham sandwich she got the musical numbers such as they were i'm sure the movie going public was paying their tickets to see cagney dance br br also in addition to giving him some dance numbers a female dance partner would have been nice he danced well with ruby keeler in footlight parade and with virginia mayo and doris day in the west point story weren't ginger rogers eleanor powell or ruby keeler available br br no memorable songs came out of this and daw's voice is waisted as well she has a jeanette macdonald soprano voice which was so out of place with a swing band br br no wonder cagney went running back to warner brothers but they should have given him some decent musicals,0
before he became defined as nick charles in the thin man series william powell played another urbane detective named philo vance the supporting cast is strong in this early talkie and powell's star quality is evident mary astor who eight years later would be defined by her portrayal of brigid o'shaughnessy does a good job here as the featured woman who finds herself in the middle of it all,1
the movie has a good start portraying an interesting and strong shannon lee and introduces two very simpathetic side characters through the first half but later something happens and all the sudden shannon turns into this straight faced second hand bad girl and the movie gets lost in it's own context the second half lacks any kind of charisma and is full of clichés bad acting a horrible plot and even worse stunt coordination not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the chechen mafia gang br br game of death 2 was bad and clownified bruce but his daughter tops it making an even bigger embarrassment of herself than the double who played bruce lee back then i truly believe that she can do much better than this and i hope she participates in a better production next time br br if you are a real hard core action fan and don't care about quality go ahead and see this movie i was personally looking forward to it but just got terribly disappointed,0
this is a really fun movie one of those you can sit and mindlessly watch as the plot gets more and more twisted more and more funny sally field teri hatcher in her hey day kevin klein elisabeth shue robert downey jr it's all these well known quality actors acting as if they are soap opera stars producers if you have ever watched a soap opera and thought how on earth did they come up with this idea you will love this movie i have seen it multiple times and each time i watch it the more i appreciate the humor the more i realize just how well acted it really is don't expect oscar quality this is a fun movie to entertain not some artsy attempt at finding man's inner man etc sit back relax and laugh,1
oh my god the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old the plot the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace br br i am not usually this critical about any movie cause every person has his her style but this movie however was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008 i can honestly believe that this movie is unknown and i think it should stay like this for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke br br i advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies or even simply movies to stay far away from this one,0
it's a while ago that i have seen sleuth 1972 with two great actors michael caine and laurence olivier michael caine is back but he is now the husband and jude law the lover of his wife the story is still the same and it's a fantastic play br br during the movie i always had the feeling to watch a play that's one of the reasons i dislike this remake of a classic when i watch a movie adapted a play i still must feel to see a movie and not just a play director kenneth brannigan did some marvelous movies in the past but this time he missed another reason was the look of the movie the design was modern stylish clean uncomfortable and cold i never got the feeling that somebody ever lived in that house the photography wasn't bad but the lightening was awful sometimes there was blue light dark green light to round it up not friendly for eyes br br the acting was really good michael caine's and jude law's perform at their best i really would like to see these 2 guys playing together on stage but i have to confess i never was a fan of jude law the weakest part was the mid part i remember that in the original that this part was still very mysterious and just marvelous directed i tried to watch it twice and always in the mid part i felt asleep the end part is better and more interesting sleuth 2007 isn't awful but it seems to be more a movie for critics than for the audience sleuth 1972 is still a masterpiece and much more entertaining than sleuth 2007,0
i loved this flick when it came out in the 80's and still do i still quote classic lines like say it again and you said you'd rip my balls off sir ron leibman was hot and very funny although it was underrated and disowned by mad i have to say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie that i would take with me if sent to a deserted island i only wish that someone would release the dvd because my vhs tape is about worn out if you like cheesed out comedy this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic it is military humor at it's best and worse rent it if you can't own it,1
the second half of steven soderbergh's revolutionary bio on che guevara deals with his last campaign to export revolution to bolivia in order to maintain his saintly visage of che soderbergh conveniently leap frogs the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in cuba and the folly of his congo adventure this is the history of a failure he writes in the preface of his congo journal to concentrate fully on che's attempt to rally support to rise up against the government in bolivia it would turn out to be a disaster and guevara's final act br br what plagued the first chapter follows suit here as soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the beatific countenance of the contemplative guevara once again being played like james dean in east of eden by bernicio del toro the problem is guevara has little success in gaining converts and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades being swallowed up in the heart of darkness bolivian jungle unlike werner herzog in the magnificent aguirre the wrath of god soderbergh fails to utilize the jungle's metaphorical possibilities to heighten the desperation of the guerrillas he seems more concerned with keeping che's nimbus above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead enders there is one herzogian moment where che sits astride an obstinate horse kicking and screaming to get it moving but overall soderbergh's mise en scene remains flat sloppy and uninteresting br br in both of his films soderbergh shows he is clearly a che groupie and because of it his focus remains myopic and narrow he spends too much time building his monument to che and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his saga especially fidel castro making matters worse he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never catches fire one would think he was steeped in enough eisenstein and vertov to realize that sweeping change is showcased a lot better with sweeping style,0
smokey and the bandit wasn't exactly shakespeare but then nobody wanted it to be it was lowdown slapstick but it did have brains it had a very smart script with definable characters and a fun wrap up people came out of the theater smiling hooper provides none of this there is no reason to smile if it's supposed to be a tribute to the hollywood stuntman it makes them look awfully lazy by providing nothing but badly choreographed fight scenes and one of the most unconvincing car jumps i've ever seen it all looks phony badly filmed almost on purpose poor sally field as the girlfriend who wrings her hands on the sidelines is given her weakest role with not a single funny or smart line if you do that jump i won't be here when you get back burt reynolds keeps looking at the camera and winking but the joke is on any audience who sits through hooper from,0
let's cut to the chase this movie is softcore pornography marketed for the masses under a name that the studio is milking every last penny out of the american pie teat period br br the whole plot and that shouldn't imply that there's a whole lot to go around serves as a vehicle to show the audience more boobs and sex scenes br br if you're a tween guy and you're too squeamish to purchase actual pornography then this is the movie for you otherwise the movie doesn't have much to offer at all br br the acting is sub par the character development is virtually non existent and the story is a nonsensical knarl of nudity binge drinking and pranks none of which are particularly memorable br br go buy real porn if that's what you want to see and if not go watch a good movie animal house kids or even the original american pie are all great cinematic works and all of them contain heavy alcohol use and nudity br br it's not how much it's how you use it,0
it is very hard to rate this film as entertainment value for 21st century viewers it fails miserably however for the student of early sound films and history it is a jewel show of shows was a revue filmed to compete with mgm's successful hollywood revue of 1929 which still survives intact complete with its technicolor scenes br br the purpose of the all star revue was to showcase a particular studio's silent stars in speaking roles and show that they could make the transition however warner bros seems to have forgotten this and employs many acts and stars that they didn't even have under long term contract such as ben turpin lloyd hamilton beatrice lillie and even a marching band meanwhile their biggest talent al jolson is noticeably absent even at a high salary he could not be compelled to join in almost every act is overly long and the film plays like a dozen or so vitaphone shorts strung together with no continuity the finale is also overly long but it is really enjoyable with all of its dance numbers br br the highlights of the film are two numbers from winnie lightner pingo pongo and singin in the bathtub a couple of numbers with nick lucas john barrymore performing shakespeare and the chinese fantasy li po li with nick lucas and myrna loy this last number is the only part of the film that survives in technicolor and it really is quite attractive reasonably enough the players in these good acts were long term warner bros stars so perhaps the director knew how to play to their strengths since he was familiar with them br br this film acts as a snapshot at an odd point in film history the year 1929 which was the bridge year between two eras the silent and sound eras and the roaring 20's and the great depression just two years later this same film would have had an entirely different cast as warner bros would abandon its silent era stars and the stars they hired just to produce the early musicals in favor of those stars that gave warner bros its distinctive urban look and feel james cagney joan blondell edward g robinson and others,1
a mummy narrates vignettes about men women and the sex between them huh at the beginning the mummy randomly asks the viewer imagine having sex with this girl imagine having sex with this boy about 37 times while flashing pictures of half naked mod youths later said mods boys pelt mod girls with vegetables if you ignore or fast forward through the mummy's rambling the shorts aren't bad in their own right i found a few of them rather funny my personal favorite is one where the sexually confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his pet lizard sits on the bed this is one well bizarre movie,0
this would've been a great silent film the acting really is good at least in a look ma i'm doing really big acting sort of way br br everything is huge every line is profound every scene is shattered by human tragedy br br mostly i felt like gagging yet like any train wreck i couldn't tear my eyes away this dialogue might've worked on the stage although i doubt it on the screen it was cluttered haphazard hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work br br if you enjoy your melodrama in huge heaping doses you might enjoy the movie be prepared to wait however for all that melodrama this thing sure plods along at its own pace br br this script must've sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves it simply doesn't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera br br imdb does us a great disservice at times when it uses its goofy computer controlled weighted score curse of the starving class deserves less than a 1 br br character driven fiction is great but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution it isn't character development your characters must have a motivation being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is not character development that's a plot contrivance br br stay away from this movie or at the very least watch it muted perhaps you'll get some amusement from all the arm waving the characters do br br oh and word to the wise to prove that this is truly an artsy film you see james woods in all his dangly male look at me i'm the figurative and literal representation of the naked vulnerability of man glory br br don't say you weren't warned,0
deeply humorous yet honest comedy about a bunch of grownups bill paxton julie warner kevin pollak elizabeth perkins vincent spano matt craven and diane lane who are invited back to spend a week to tomawka a camp in ontario canada by their former consuelor alan arkin writer director mike binder drew upon his experience at the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding yarn that makes sense also the movie has plenty of funny moments some of which are completely bizarre like my favorite the one involves using masking tape newton thomas sigel the usual suspects three kings provides the film with some impressive shots of the canadian wilderness among the cast sam raimi director of the evil dead films and the gift appears here as arkin's bumbling right hand man one more thing this film reassured me that a camp doesn't have to be a site of bloody murders,1
this is the worst movie i've ever seen i'm not kidding the next time it comes on i will just continually run my head into a wall it would me more enjoyable to sit in an emergency room trying to explain to a doctor why my brain is swollen than attempting to make it through this movie again br br i hope that black and stiller never work together on a project this bad again they are both good comedians so i was shocked this was so awkward br br if they had to do it all over again i'm pretty sure that they would decide to not do it the folks that fronted the money must have lost a ton not really because the special effects all 2 of them were terrible,0
spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to ever see this film so not really spoiler after all saw this film when it was released and can still remember parts of it it's all set in a small town in the west or what is left of that town it more resembles a ghost town with few inhabitants among them a couple where the wife is especially wicked she lets her man die in the end of the film and leaves the town but has to cross the desert we never know what happens to her next but just before she left her dying man shoots after her and deliberately does not hit her and instead the water supply she is not aware of that soon she will be very thirsty mark damon kills a couple of bad guys in a funny manor but that's another story which i don't remember too good the remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times i saw a really wicked woman on film who pretends to be anything but wicked can't be compared with the witch in 'snowwhite' who in comparison is easy to find out very tight western with few main characters and still absorbing,1
this beautiful story of an elder son coming home and learning to love and be a part of all those things that he left home to get away from is poignant and moving it shows a society that is perhaps strange to us in the western world with a sense of family that we have lost the story is beautiful sad and at times funny and comic it has a feeling of realism that we don't seem to see any longer in our western movies br br the acting is unusual in that as the movie progresses it almost gives the impression that it is not acting but a documentary of ordinary people this is brilliant directing and movie making br br would love to see more movies by this director,1
excellent movie a realistic picture of contemporary finland touching and profound one of the best finnish films ever made captures marvelously the everyday life in a central finland small town people's desires and weaknesses joys and sorrows the bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this lucid examination of people in a welfare society lampela is indeed one of the most promising finnish filmmakers he shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed his next film eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in joki,1
it could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience shumlin didn't do a bad job but it is not a great work of cinematic art br br it is however a beautiful movie i have loved it since local channels used to show it graham greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories many love the fallen idol but i am not among them i think i saw brighton rock once many years ago and liked it but maybe i'm simply thinking fondly of the novel this is superbly cast charles boyer does not it's true come across as spanish but he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character tired wary caring lauren bacall is appealing as the british girl who falls for him but the supporting players are the best katina paxinou is excellent her performance is a little grand guignol but i attribute that to the director peter lorre whom we first meet as he gives boyer a lesson in an esperanto like universal language is excellent as always br br and wanda hendrix could break the hardest heart she comes across as a precocious early teenager the character wants to be helpful she does her best br br i recommend this movie highly not without reservations the reservation is primarily that it is a little stolid but the story and acting can scarcely be bettered,1
i watched it with my mom and we were like br br what the hell we didn't get it at all i may have this wrong but a chair had something to do with the death of this woman's father that movie was terrible this is not a movie for those who love a good suspense movie bad suspense movie shakes cane at movie i'm never seeing it again and i'm a big fan of lifetime movies too they kinda need to quit trying to make movies outta books it's driving me crazy br br and whit was butt ugly and yet she loves him more than hugh who was a tiny bit nicer looking br br my rating 1 10,0
this a superb self contained work that is unconnected with anything before or after brat pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my biscuits of choice but in this law free world they make an alluring ambiance the film is packed with our guys distinctive actors who add distinction to this work with winning performances the dialogue is a joy in fact it's a new vernacular one of the few films that can be watched repeatedly with deepening appreciation br br highpoints include billy idol's british loutishness ben london's vulturine brassware kyle's squirmishness and the survey of ad hoc philosophies,1
wow i can't believe people consider this a 'good' movie now i have seen much worse but there are much more romantic funny comedies with john cusack br br this is a mediocre film at best while the acting wasn't terrible but not great for a romantic comedy there was little passion little romance there were many loose ends that don't show up or are not addressed unfortunately the main characters do come off as complete cowards they don't know themselves well enough to realize that they don't love the people they are engaged to how do we know they aren't in love by the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances i can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show br br the movie doesn't even end with a wedding scene more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing this movie is really about two people who can't commit to anything unlike cusack's previous characters who were more than willing to make a deep commitment loyd in say anything martin in grosse pointe blank etc br br the greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns or anything of interest when the movie ended i felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story which basically fits the whole movie boring no suspense about whether the two will end up together no joy when they do no consequences to their actions br br it is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie that they simply rebuke any criticism with 'everyone is too cynical ' criticism of this movie is not cynicism simply unbiased examination there are many other better romantic comedies even ones with grace kelly or eva marie saint br br if you think this movie is great try these movies you hearts will explode the princess bride say anything grosse pointe blank high fidelity keeping the faith charade rear window north by northwest or there's something about mary which is a good examination of idealized romance vs today's society,0
this movie seems to start in the middle introduces peripheral players as if they were significant and presents main characters without any substance and paper thin and or impenetrable back stories almost nobody has a credible or discernible motivation for their actions in this film the plot rambles and ultimately goes nowhere the dialogue is clunky and trite and the director has little concept of how to get the best from his actors it almost feels like there's a first half of this movie but it never got made br br we're told that a mysterious pyramid has appeared over new york city and that central park has inexplicably become an arctic wasteland yet none of this seems to have caused much of a stir amongst the general population and is only of minimal concern to the government br br we're presented with the evil corporation in eugenics but that's really just a convenient conceit to populate the universe with a couple power tripping minions the whole eugenics is bad double entendre is heavy handed and never really pans out here we're supposed to care about the central characters but we never learn enough about them to know why so much about this world is underdeveloped or completely undeveloped that it comes off as a 1 hour 40 minute fatalistic rationalization for rape br br on the ground breaking digitally animated world created here all i can say is that at about the same time as this film was made several other directors did the same thing with more seamless and believable results br br after spending the time to watch this film the most burning question left in my mind was so what,0
a long film about a very important character from south africa stephen biko he is one of these blacks who did not survive apartheid who actually died a long time before their normal time the already old film though does not show how important biko was what he really represented his life and his teaching is reduced to little at best a few witty remarks the film being from 1987 the objective was to push south africa over the brink that would lead her to liberation so the film aims at showing how irrational the south african supporters of apartheid are in 1987 to show this the film has to look beyond biko's death hence to center its discourse not on biko but on a white liberal journalist and his escaping the absurd system in which he is living his escape is made necessary because of the victimization he is the victim of along with his family and because he wants to publish the first book on biko after his death and that can only happen in england the film shows a way to escape south africa while apartheid is still standing and killing so do not expect this way to be realistic and true it could not be but the film has tremendously aged because it does not show south africa with any historical distantiation the very distantiation that has taken place under nelson mandela's presidency and that is called forgiveness provided those who want to be forgiven speak up and out the film is strong and emotional but that very historical limit makes it rather weak today especially since the film does not mention the third racial community the indians panegyric books or films all have that defect they are looking at the person they are supposed to portrait from only one point of view that explains why the film has aged so much seems to be coming from so long ago as if nothing had changed at all a remake is necessary br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines cegid,1
terrible i don't want to be too negative but this film has an iq of stupid monkey what a disaster i just couldn't believe how bad this movie is the dialogs are just very strange and off topic the camera work at times just horrible the music at times like a soundtrack for lawrence of arabia i just watched this film to see how much worse it can get some of the side kick actors are total disaster sorry but all my thumbs and toes and anything that can hang downwards on my body is falling to the ground harvey keitle is a great actor but who knows maybe he is in financial crunch to take a part in such a fiasco film this movie should have been presented to all the students in all the film schools just to teach them a lesson of how not to make a film,0
actor herman josé plays the role of a football of a soccer entrepreneur that acquires the pass of two african players and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival club of the benfica club of its heart fc porto therefore these players did not play well and it wanted that the fc port was wronged with this but what happens is that these two players after all are good and fc porto sell them for much money to a foreign club making a good business the film for a small country as portugal without great antecedents in great films is a very good and funny comedy showing all the rivalry that exists between north south of portugal fc porto benfica highly recommended,1
is it a remake og the thing 1982 1951 i think it is there are so many factors from det previous movies do deny it br br so the acting is bad james spader does a superlow stargate re enactment of himself with his coffy mug and his somwhat strange thinking movements but that's about it the other actors i did't even notise you don't get the feeling of getting to know anyone of the main characters and the plot evolvement is slow boring and yah i know what is about to happend in 30mins score music is ultraboring imean there are alot of ubertallented people out there that would make scores for a coke and a credit but this is major crap some of the special effects are nice if it was made in early 90's if you like slimy aliens chills and thrills don't whatch this movie its a dull combination of the thing alien 3 outbreak and some jerry bruckheimer michael bay production gone really really bad now this combination would be cool if somone knew what they where doing and the only ones on this production that knew that was no one br br though i have seen far worse i would not recomend this movie to anyone but if you are up one cold night and just wanna glanse at something it will pass the time slowly,0
just another example of why stepehn king's books should not be made into movies even carrie one of the best is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen the premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer always on a diet who accidentally kills an old gypsy woman in court with the help of the judge and the local police chief he gets off even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving the father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3 with our main character billy the lawyer getting thinner and thinner by the day though the movie kept with the book for the most part and has your typical king ending the acting was stilted and felt forced we went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between sort of like reading acts in a play king himself made a cameo in the movie sort of like dave barry which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that authors leave the acting to actors not that anyone in this movie was that great i've seen the major characters in movies where they were much better,0
this is a excellent start to the film career of mickey rooney his talents here shows that a long career is ahead for him the car and truck chase is exciting for the 1937 era this start of the andy hardy series is an american treasure in my book spring byington performance is excellent as usual please mr rooney or owners of the film rights take a chance and get this produced on dvd i think it would be a winner,1

i can't believe currently this movie is rated a 6 9 anyway this movie was probably one of the most touching real indian movies i have ever seen it was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema as for the story i thought it was great it was about shahid kapur being set up on an arranged marriage with amrita rao he is kind of a happy go lucky kind of guy while amrita rao is a traditional indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle but the only problem is her cousin doesn't seem to get as much attention as she does so her aunt dislikes amrita with a passion this upsets amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her it was also very touching to see that although amrita's family wasn't that rich maybe just middle class to lower class while shahids family was quite upper class they still treated their family with respect and didn't even ask put them down which really struck a nerve with me this is because i've actually seen people being very rude to people who are not as well of thinking their below their standards which i feel is very shallow this movie showed that shahids family was willing to look at the great values that amrita had been brought up with and turned a blind eye to the fact she wasn't a rich business tycoons daughter or anything all in all this movie deserved an 8 10 i wish more and more of these kind of movies were made,1

in order to stop her homosexual friend albert perry king from being deported back to belgium stella meg foster decides to marry him the only other problem with that is that stella herself is a lesbian the two have their separate lives when one night after albert's birthday party they fall into bed and then into love later in the film after falling in love stella suspects albert of cheating and shows up at his job one night late after closing what she finds will leave the viewer stunned this is a great film very original perry king and meg foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here very controversial upon its release in 1978 the r rated film is now pg in this much more liberal time br br recently released on dvd the disc contains a making of segment on the special features and in it it's stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not real are mistaken everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons these are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved,1
i found this a very entertaining small kids movie that actually is geared more for adults with a lot of jokes and humor only they would understand a few things are inappropriate for the kiddies but just a few othewise the grinch jim carrey cracks so many jokes you can't keep up with them all ranging from sexual to cultural to insider hollywood to racial br br the film is very colorful and looks great on dvd the little girl in here cindy lou who taylor momsen is really cute and the costumes and hairdos of the little people in here are fun to view anthony hopkins' voice is pleasing too so having his narrate this elevates the movie further his rhymes are fun to hear br br i saw this in the theater though it was fair but on dvd it was far better i've seen in three times and it got better each time,1
this can't be mandy schaffer's last film somebody do something br br argh br br what little life this one might have had the directing finished off don't blame the cast they did ok even the winemaker's younger brother was pretty well done and he didn't even get into the movie until halfway through and please please put mandy in some more movies she's too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age ya' breakin' my haht heah br br two specific criticisms in case anyone cares apparently nobody liked this movie very much first the way traci kept popping up at just the right melodramatic moment in order to see whatever she was supposed to see and never got seen in return was very annoying hollywood please stop giving villains perfect timing luck which runs out exactly when the climax arrives it's dumb write better scripts so you won't have to use that lame plot device any more if your script isn't good enough to stand up without that then don't produce it br br second carmen wouldn't have fallen for that fake injury trick that traci pulled she already had traci fingered more bad writing directing there br br i could trash this movie further but mercy forbids it actually i didn't hate it as much as the others seem to have it just didn't have much of a reason for being made unless it was purely a vehicle to show off the lovely mandy oh and to whoever didn't think she was sexy the character wasn't very well written but how can you say she wasn't sexy one or the other of us needs glasses and i don't think it's me br br more mandy not to be confused with moore mandy although i'd like to see her again too br br p s did i mention i hope mandy makes me more movies d,0
it is always a nice suprise when a film made for tv turns out to be entertaining such as little richard this is a very watchable film about the story of rock and roller little richard played by an actor called leon who i have never seen before but does an very good job as most tv films this is a little tamer than if made for cinema which is a shame because i am sure there is lot we could have seen about little richard that was controversial instead we see a lot religous rubbish which is the only thing that spoils the film and eventually spoilt a very promising career all in all this film is good and the acting is above average fot a tv film 7 out of 10,1
although this movie has some weaknesses it is worth seeing i chose it because of the cast and applaud bonham carter and branagh for choosing roles different from those they have taken in the past both portray very troubled people complete with warts but make them likeable because of their humanity the story is touching but it is the performances that soar bonham carter's jane is a remarkable achievement whose quest for romance opened my eyes to aspects of being disabled that i had not thought of before but was interesting as well for other reasons i felt the movie ended too abruptly but better that than a drawn out emotionally manipulative ending see stepmom the very real english setting added to my enjoyment it was england in the 90's both urban and rural without being depressing,1
to be brutally honest i loved watching severed that's why i br br gave it a 1 10 stars because of its starkly unimaginative br br story filming acting everything this film was a riot to watch if br br you enjoy watching bad films in order to poke fun at them you will br br really get a kick out of severed br br the story really doesn't matter it involves some guy who's bald br br and has a sword and goes around beheading random people br br but he has a supernatural twist nobody ever sees him do it br br even when in one very memorable scene he walks into a br br jampacked night club and whacks off some girl's noodle and br br nobody sees it br br severed doesn't merely look like it was filmed on video it was br br filmed on someone's home camcorder the filmmakers had br br knowledge of lighting very thin knowledge and composition br br actually holds together in some scenes but mostly you can't hear br br the actors you can't understand what they're doing and you laugh br br when the next vicitm gets his pumpkin detatched from his body br br go and rent this movie support films like this they are a hoot and br br a hollar,0
i go to a lot of movies often i bring my 5 year old son i am so glad i did not bring him to this one there are many references to sex and a skinny dipping scene however that is not the primary reason i would not take him to it the trailers lead you to believe it is a light hearted comedy nevertheless virtually all of the funny moments are in the previews i kept waiting for it to get interesting funny or anything but serious however i nearly fell asleep as the plot less story dragged on i understand that dogs can be great company that being said the entire story focused on a poorly behaving dog that the owners were not savvy enough to train if a human caused this much damage and mayhem that person would be banned the worst movie i've ever seen with jenifer aniston or owen wilson a waste of their talent the best way to sum up this movie is couple gets unruly dog couple falls in love with dog dog dies couple sad the end,0
excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies they couldn't live together nor apart babbling constantly sometimes at the same time they hashed and re hashed the past going on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda i found myself laughing at times but mostly i was taken with how utterly sad and abandoned these two women were see this one,1
best of the best 4 is better than 3 but just barely basically i say this because part 4 doesn't contradict parts 1 2 like 3 does ie their is no reference to tommy lee having siblings br br anyway i liked the russian plot line of the story and especially sven ole thorsen's bit part as boris aside from that though and a few fighting scenes the movie is nothing special the limited budget is also very noticeable especially in the airplane blow up scene br br also part 4 does not really have a moral or say anything like part 3 did there are a couple of more better known actors hudson thorsen in part 4 but alas nothing like the beginning of the series and even these characters have very small roles br br alas it seems best of the best is the rhee show and to be truthful he cannot carry a movie br br saw on tape rating 4,0
this film has been receiving a lot of play lately during the day on either hbo or cinemax the reason is that they are assuming people would be interested in comparing it to the leonardo dicaprio tom hanks caper of the same name the only reason to see it is for the attractive matt lattanzi yum although i must say matt was more than a little long in the tooth to be playing a high schooler if he were a woman they'd have had him playing the mother of a high schooler is is just me or is his daughter starting to look like shelley duvall oh yeah the plot who cares typical teen highjinx played by adults,0
yes i call this a perfect movie not one boring second a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives i could sympathize with perfect lighting crisp black and white photography a fitting soundtrack an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works it's one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of hollywood should rest the mark everyone should endeavor to reach br br barbara stanwyck is simply stunning there was nothing this actress couldn't do and she always went easy on the melodramatic side no hysterical outbursts with this lady i always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like bette davis or joan crawford and this movie confirmed my opinion always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments it is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career and this one is by far the least interesting br br the title fits this movie very well it is about desires human desires i think everyone can understand actually no one seems to be scheming in this movie all characters act on impulse everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else the sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which i will not go here br br i liked what this movie has to say about youth about maturing and about the necessity to compromise the movie i associate most with this one is alfred hitchcock's shadow of a doubt it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured small town america the story has a certain similarity with fritz lang's considerably harsher movie clash by night made one year earlier where stanywck stars in a similar part i can also recommend it,1
i did not enjoy the film joshua at all perhaps it is because i saw another much better similar film titled orphan 2 days prior but perhaps it's really just because this film was not very good i am going with the ladder sure the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that doesn't mean the film could not succeed it could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building boring uneventful and really didn't leave me thinking anything more than 'that wasn't very good' when it was all over br br at the end joshua's motivations are revealed i won't give that away but the reality is that he didn't really accomplish his goals since despite vera farmiga as his mother abby disappearing about 3 4th through the movie all arrows point to her returning home soon she was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then joshua's father her husband was accused of tampering with her medication which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally ill but rather was being dosed medically so shouldn't she be coming home soon won't joshua have failed won't his mother be living with him and his sister and possibly his father soon i question the father since his future is left open ended br br at the end of the day i didn't care about the characters the evil demon child joshua wasn't really scary the storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring suspense fell flat every single time when it was over i couldn't believe i had sat through the whole thing br br 4 10 just because the acting was good from the parents especially vera farmiga as the mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil 'child' go see orphan now that's a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie,0
this was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the night gallery show back in 1971 the episode starred sue lyon of lolita movie fame and joseph campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire respectively the vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster while he goes out at night for blood the baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire's appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child she realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally she bolts out the door the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over i don't know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes they should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one a total wasted effort,0
gojoe is part of a new wave of japanese cinema taking very creative directors editors and photographers and working on historic themes what the japanese call period pieces gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color photography and editing brilliant even the new wave of japanese samurai films allows a peek at traditional beliefs in shamanism demons and occult powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture but not really explored in kurosawa's samurai epics or the zaitochi series another fine example of this genre is onmyoji 2001 i would place director sogo ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave japanese directors other recent japanese period pieces i would highly recommend include yomada's twilight samurai 2002 and shintaro katsu's zatoichi the blind swordsman 2003,1
the title should have been the walker that was only he did walk br br there was nothing on the movie that was good the description of the movie doesn't really comply with the plot br br the only thing that i can get from the movie is that he was a good son but a low life terrible person br br i'm sorry that i expend my money and time on this movie i saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie i stayed hoping that it will better what a mistake i got worse br br if there is a suggestion that i can make to he producer is to re direct his life to another field because making movies is definitely no his cup of tea,0
it had to be you is another sign that hollywood is running out of ideas this picture is about charlie hudson a former police officer turned author when charlie's fiancé goes out of town he's stuck with all of the wedding planning he spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets anna penn a teacher who just happens to also be getting married the two quickly become friends and set out to plan their separate weddings together this is when the plot gets boring charlie falls in love with anna and she has to choose between a safe life or charlie this movie rips off every romantic comedy ever made and just has you waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else micahel vartan and natasha henstridge give really mediocre performances which just makes this movie all the more gut wrenching to watch,0

what a powerful start to a film when julia roberts character is punched in the face by her abusive and anal husband played by patrick bergin and i felt ready to experience a powerful film on the same level as farrah fawcett's the burning bed well as the summary says i was mis lead this film was nothing like the burning bed which had power and farrah played the part of a woman you truly felt for and felt her pain and her need to survive sleeping with the enemy drifted off after the first act into cheap thrills with roberts faking her death to escape her husband and goes to live in iowa her husband at first believes she is dead but starts to grow suspicious that she may still be alive and sets off after her the rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game with julia getting a house in this small town in iowa and changing her identity there is no mention of course how she got the money for this but at this point in the film i did not care all that much she meets a guy mr nice wimpy and falls for him and her husband does finally catch up to her but not before he re arranges her soup cans and straightens up the kitchen this was i assume to provide a cheap thrill to the audience but i did not care much if she was an abused wife because the film as i have said cheated the audience if it had stayed the course i might have felt for her and her situation of course the husband is killed and all is well for little ol ms roberts if only the real world was anything close to this see the burning bed and you understand what a film is suppose to be like on the subject of domestic abuse,0

well first off i'd like to add that i myself is somewhat of a historian so what i look for in a film that is based upon historical events is that it is actually based upon historical facts but this is however not the case here sure the movie is entertaining and all but the fact that it isn't entirely based upon true facts is more than annoying hitler wasn't anti semitic in his youth he even worked for jews before world war one it was however during world war one and after that he formed his views about the jews his upbringing in this movie is also inaccurate hitler as a child wasn't a disturbed little brat he had a more or less normal upbringing nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that adds to the puzzle that is hitler br br robert carlyle is a great actor but he doesn't really fit in the role as hitler hitler wasn't as impossible and unstable as he is portrait ed here under his younger years he was a charismatic person whom manipulated people through his charms his unstable behavior and rage outbursts started in the turning point of the war br br i'd like to see a film about hitler's life that is based upon real historical facts and not accusations i really hate when people point a blaming finger at for example hitler and others and tell inaccurate stories just to paint a picture of them as pure evil it is much better to actually tell the story exactly as it was so that everyone can learn what it was like the ones behind this movie should have made some research before making this because it seems as if they didn't even know what really happened hitler wasn't even shot in the revolutionary march in munch his shoulder was ripped out of its socket br br it gives you more to see a good documentary than seeing this,0
lets first start this review with the fact that i signed up just to write the review and warn people to save their money br br this was one of the worst pieces of trash i have seen since the hulk the storyline was the most predictable garbage you could possibly come up with if you are expecting 24 but on the big screen flush that expectation down the toilet immediately along with the money you would use for a ticket you may get more enjoyment that way the acting was terrible the plot was completely unrealistic along with the so called twist in the end i must say this the ending did surprise me i am not referring to the plot twist that surprised me but instead the effortless manner that they put together what could be considered the only scene of somewhat decent action in the entire movie they rushed the ending so quickly that i didn't even realize that it was over until i saw the credits rolling and at that point i considered burning the reel of film if i could just figure out how to get into that screening room br br casting was awful for a few reasons first of all they must have accidentally switched the character assignments because michael douglas played the roll that clearly keifer sutherland should have been playing while douglas was sneaking around agents tapping phone lines hacking into systems and taking out people who are chasing after him sutherland plays the less capable agent who is always in a bad mood even when things aren't going that badly for him he plays a very bland agent nothing like his jack bauer type roll us 24 fans love br br i can just about promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas it can be best compared to a remake of the the fugitive in the line of fire but written by people with mental disabilities,0
i love this movie it is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging congratulations i believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves it is so eerie you feel like you are watching a real life band i would like to see more movies like this i am glad that they did not choose famous hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked and even if billy connolly is quite well known he really got stuck into the role and i could not imagine anybody else playing it congratulations again i really believe this movie deserves the peter sellers comedy award for bill nighy and when you get to the final scene well what can i say,1
in addition to his tarzan series the prolific edgar rice burroughs did write many other books although aside from the popular at the earth's core few of these have been filmed one exception is the novel entitled the lad and the lion brought to the screen as the lion man 1936 an over talkative static old hat slow moving and rather dull movie despite being filmed on real desert locations actually movie is the wrong word the narrative doesn't move but proceeds at a snail's pace in an abrupt series of jerks for instance at least five characters are given elaborate opening scenes and then just disappear even more frustrating for the keen movie fan are the characters who make an impression of sorts like the lass who plies hall with drugged wine but are enacted by players who are not credited the credited thespians generally come off worse than the unknowns one exception is australian actress finis barton who gives a good account of the kidnapped harem girl who rescues young master fairy admittedly most of the cast are saddled with atrocious king james dialogue which has to be heard to be believed but the way to play this rubbish is tongue in cheek a stratagem which does not seem to have occurred to a single one of the film's roster of no talent players maybe director j p mccarthy scotched that idea anyway it's sad to see the lovely kathleen burke forced to trade lines with the likes of richard carlyle her dad and jon hall her suitor admittedly mr hall delivers his lines with marginally more conviction than mr carlyle but that is no recommendation,0
uta hagen's respect for acting is the standard textbook in many college theater courses in the book hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor the presentational approach and the representational approach in the presentational approach the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible by introducing emotional elements from the actor's own life in the representational approach the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion through a high degree of control of movement and sound br br the representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this hamlet was made british theater has a long history of this style of acting and olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the representational school br br time has not been kind to this school of acting or to this movie nearly every working actor today uses a presentational approach to the modern eye olivier's highly enunciated stylized delivery is stodgy stiff and stilted instead of creating an internally conflicted hamlet olivier made a declaiming self important bullhorn out of the melancholy dane an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger london theaters but is far too starchy to carry off a modern hamlet br br and so the movie creaks along ungainfully today olivier's tendency to e nun ci ate makes some of hamlet's lines unintentionally funny in stead you must ac quire and be get a tem purr ance that may give it smooth ness instead of crying at meeting his father's ghost as any proper actor could bright fill lights in olivier's pupils give us that impression br br eileen herlie is the only other actor of note in this hamlet putting in a good essay at the queen despite the painfully obvious age differences he was 41 she was 26 the other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done given olivier's tendency to want to keep the camera on him at all times br br sixty years later you feel the insecurity of the shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable flawed hamlet and instead elected to portray a sort of elizabethan bullhorn final analysis i would have such a fellow whipped for o'er doing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it,0
i saw this film at the rotterdam festival as did presumably all the other voters the director was present and seemed to have worked very hard and be very committed to the project which i think explains the above average reception and mark it got it's most similar to a feature length episode of aussie kids favourite round the twist but it takes itself too seriously to have even that redeeming feature the movie in itself is maybe worth seeing if you're trying to do a cinematic world tour visiting all un member states as i can't think of another fijian movie but overall it was generic poorly acted albeit by an amateur cast and prey to the subaltern mentality the moral of the story seemed to be that native islanders will try and screw each other over but as long as there is an essentially decent white governor to step in all problems can be solved by leaving the island,0
i've just visited russian forum of our tv channel that had showed this film well 99 per cent of active russian audience is disappointed we wanted to see more true facts of our space achievements in this film but authors had in mind something else we are big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here we are proud of all our space dreams real achievements on the one hand in this field and in science on the other hand so i'd like to ask authors where is our lunohod and where the hell our mir station ah i'm quite sure that lunohod events took place much earlier armstrong's walk on moon and to comment numerous technical and science mistakes i really have no time and enough space here se our constructive critics in russian forum on www 1tv ru,0
this movie was kind of interesting i had to watch it for a college class about india however the synopsis tells you this movie is about one thing when it doesn't really contain much cold hard information on those details it is not really true to the synopsis until the very end where they sloppily try to tie all the elements together the gore factor is superb however even right at the very beginning you want to look away because the gore is pretty intense only watch this movie if you want to see some cool gore because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted time listening to it i've seen rumors on other websites about this movie being based on true events however you can not find any information about it online so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch,0
i don't even know where to begin on this one it's all about the family that has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a horror movie although this couldn't be a horror movie even if it tried ugh and i know that owen wilson is a better actor he needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie anaconda armageddon after all the man did co write bottle rocket and rushmore he does have some talent also lily taylor should stick to indie films she has no place here finally catherine zeta jones should become a porn star there's no room in legitimate acting for her i'm serious one of the worst movies i've ever seen ever,0
i guess i was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor so i gave it a chance from director gregor jordan buffalo soldiers basically ned kelly heath ledger is set up by the police especially superintendent francis hare geoffrey rush he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family's names that's really all i can say about the story as i wasn't paying the fullest attention to be honest also starring orlando bloom as joseph byrne naomi watts as julia cook laurence kinlan as dan kelly philip barantini as steve hart joel edgerton as aaron sherritt kiri paramore as constable fitzpatrick kerry condon as kate kelly emily browning as grace kelly and rachel griffiths as susan scott ledger makes a pretty good performance for what it's worth and the film does have it's eye catching moments particularly with a gun battle towards the end but i can't say i enjoyed it as i didn't look at it all okay,0
much worse than the original it was actually painful to sit through and it barely held my six year old's interest br br introduction of some new pokemon is marginally interesting but storyline is extra thin dialogue is still bad and music is mediocre watch the television show instead it's much better,0
a couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in china wang lung paul muni buys o lan his future wife who becomes his slave luis rainer american stars appear in the leading roles talking with fake accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology a good wife many children and land are the best things for men to have they are seen as property and investment because it is a big budget movie in which many extras cooperate big sets are built and special effects take place the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors luise rainer won an academy award for this performance which is definitely the worst in the movie her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience o lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with on the other hand paul muni gives a better performance showing his talent ones again another problem with the movie is the ending it seems like franklin did not know when to end the picture this film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of chinese culture and traditions,0
bottom of the freddy barrel this is the worst film in the series beating freddy's revenge for that title a cheap looking with mediocre special effects incoherent mess with freddy turned into a punster he has one or two cool lines but that doesn't save this illogical and sloppy sequel,0
i must pat myself on the back for watching this movie all the way through because it truly was painful an incapable painter becomes a fully capable hit man this movie was rife with absurdities of which if i mentioned them all i would be giving away the movie norm peterson aka george wendt must really be in a rut to have agreed to do this movie the acting was deplorable and the story was even worse as a sane minded and rational individual i could not understand where the writer came from nor where he was going with this movie there was ineptness on the part of every main character there was a string of hapless and ridiculous events then the movie ended one absurd act after another with dialogue doesn't make a movie it only makes a talkative train wreck,0
may i start off by saying that casey affleck is a very talented actor and i respect his work very much i wish he was in more movies that showcased his talent with this said soul survivors was a very very bad movie very bad br br i would have to say that i lay almost all the blame on the poor script affleck is a very talented actress wes bentley had an outstanding performance in american beauty melissa sagemiller did well and eliza dushku is currently the it girl in hollywood i don't think any of the actors really got into the script and i understand why to say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an overstatement it did have the twists and turns you would expect but they just didn't lead anywhere except to more confusion i just found the ending very anti climatic because it just didn't seem to make any sense or really answer any of the questions that i had about the storyline br br i wish i could give this movie a good review but i can't in all honesty the only thing i think you will find scary about this movie is that you paid for it,0
fay grim is on its face a tale of espionage and intrigue told with a nod and a wink as the sequel to his extraordinary henry fool hal hartley creates a surprising blend of film noir and hardboiled spy thriller that starts with a knowing smile and large dose of laughter and turns as poignant and warm as any film i've seen this year br br parkey posey is fay grim an unwitting mata hari caught between the love of her exiled husband henry fool and the questionable intentions of a charming cia operative as agent fulbright jeff goldblum is a master of wit and sarcasm in a role that seems tailored to his talents he has never been better james urbaniak is fay's brother simon jailed but renowned for his wildly popular books of poetry his love of his work and his sister brings a jolt of passion to contrast the dour nature of the spies which eventually populate fay's world and liam aiken is fay's oversexed 14 year old son although that may be redundant aiken's understated style is remarkably old soul for someone his age br br the entire film is shot dutch angle the off kilter style made famous by orson welles and used primarily in horror films and psychological thrillers to impart a sense of foreboding in fay grim using that style from opening credits to closing is intriguing at first deceptively clever the next for just as the viewer begins to fall for the perfectly timed comedic elements and wit of hartley's brilliant script something happens the film takes a dark yet strangely comforting turn as these characters magically become sympathetic before our eyes what began as dark comedy morphs into romantic drama and the transition is masterful slow pacing gives way to breathtaking action and we are sucked right into the vortex br br in the end hartley's sharp dialog combined with the amazing performances of a perfectly matched ensemble cast makes for a delicious cinematic cocktail told with the luxury of one able to write produce direct edit and even compose the music hal hartley has crafted a smart sexy tale of espionage with tongue just barely planted in cheek fay grim is one part dashiell hammett one part raymond chandler and one part ian fleming shaken and maybe stirred as well,1
this is a brilliant documentary that follows the life of herge and his creating tintin its based around a series of interviews conducted in 1971 and covers every thing from his early life and nazi collaboration to the final moments of his life br br brilliantly edited very cinematic and fast paced enough to not get boring this film will give you a new appreciation for the work of herge br br the film makers make the film more than just another documentary using the latest state of the art technology and for a change putting it to good use br br recently more and more documentaries have been making it to cinemas but this one as to be amongst the best,1
i grew up on scooby doo where are you and i still love it it is one of my favourite cartoons along with darkwing duck talespin peter pan and the pirates and tom and jerry this show though is good for kids the voices are good don messick and casey kasem are perfect as scooby and shaggy the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation however it is rather disappointing i normally don't mind scrappy but when he appears to be like the main character it gets annoying fast complete with the catchphrase puppy power scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual also half the gang are missing after the first year somehow it didn't feel like scooby doo and the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal very little chasing monsters or unmasking the baddies all in all not as bad as shaggy and scooby doo get a clue but this show is disappointing 4 10 for the animation voices theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids bethany cox,0
meatball machine has got to be one of the most complex ridiculous awful and over exaggerated sci fi horror films that i have ever came across it is about good against evil and a coming of age tale with the aim of to entertain with bloody sleazy and humorous context because of that the violence isn't particularly gruesome and it doesn't make you squirm but the gratuitous bloodletting and nudity does run freely the performances by issei takahashi and toru tezuka is the worst i have seen if that was not enough it is also directed by an unheard of director called yudai yamaguchi this movie just have it all it is bad to the bone a must see for every b movie freak simply an enjoying and rare gem,0
i like peter sellers most of the time i had never seen him portray an upper class brit until this movie he pulls it off pretty well although you see bits of inspector clouseau in the mix it doesn't get interesting until goldie hawn arrives br br i never expected the youthful hawn to deliver such a solid performance her timing was great and her expressions were priceless the way she alternately shoots sellers lecherous character down and seduces him is beautiful to watch verbal sparring like i've seldom seen from a movie of that era br br the last thirty minutes of the movie does fall flat it is worth the let down just to see the first sixty hawn is nude for a few glorious seconds early on enjoy it,1
i'm kinda torn on dark angel the film appears to be a loving tribute to the greatest pin up to ever live but there is so little actual content that the film itself is virtually pointless i can't really see what the motivation or point of this film is as there is very little biographical information provided in the narrative so those who don't know much about bettie aren't gonna know much more after watching dark angel either br br the film basically chronicles the last few years of bettie's career in bondage modeling almost the entire film is comprised of re enactments of some of bettie's more famous photo shoots and loops these re enactments take up literally 75 of the films run time and give virtually no insight into bettie as a person the film touches briefly on her short lived legitimate acting pursuits and her subsequent decision to leave the business and become religious but all of this is pretty much glossed over in favor of showing long and drawn out re enactment scenes br br dark angel isn't a horrible film there's just no substance to it the other problem is that the actress that plays bettie only really resembles her in farther away shots up close it's a no go the other thing that irritated me is that although bettie did several topless modeling shoots the only nudity in the film was a short segment shot in a zoo during the end credits the film itself is obviously extremely low budget but does what it can set and costume wise within it's limitations so no gripes from me there the acting is pretty wooden and unmemorable from everyone involved in fact the most memorable thing about the whole film for me was noticing during the end credits that the actor who played irving klaw's real name is dukey flyswatter no joke check the cast list can't say that i recommend this one too highly unless you are a true bettiefile completist and must own anything relating to her and if you are that bad off then you need to seek treatment anyway 4 10,0
nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of italian zombie flicks but  honestly  why would we bother every single film in the zombi series delivers great fun nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and zombi 3 is no exception to this despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting this film began as an interesting lucio fulci project who had to elaborate further on his zombi 2 success but it ended up being a typical bruno mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films the screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity every ingenious idea from george a romero's night of the living dead and the crazies is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over the top gore compensates for everything on a secret army base at the phillipines scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus death one and prepare it for transport after a failing attempt to steal the virus the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village the last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area this movie is comparable to umberto lenzi's nightmare city truly bad but incredibly entertaining with fast paced action sequences and several very creative zombie madness situations the undead birds were original for example and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well the infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant italian zombie flick recommended to the fans don't mind the negative reviews,1
i'm a belgian and grew up in the sixties most of the us series were shown over here original language with subtitles and batman was one of the first i was keen on unfortunately over here it caused a panic hysteria amongst the mothers because batman was considered as too violent geez compare the innocence of that series to the crap kids get to see nowadays so because of my the over protective mothers from the 60s i only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes i got so frustrated i started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards still got them to compensate i even got the view master slides i had an urge to see the caped crusader all kids need some kind of hero br br years later i finally got the chance to see the re runs as an adolescent and i enjoyed it tremendously the tongue in cheek acting would have escaped me when i would've watched it as a kid but i understood it at the age of 17 yeah i've watched them all now and the occasional kind soul on the internet posts episodes because they haven't released the series on dvd to my knowledge br br this evening i enjoyed return to the bat cave it was a delight to watch because it was full of trivia and inside jokes to see adam and burt was a delight and this tv movie is simply fantastic in every aspect they play themselves as they played their parts in the series br br congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic feast i'm gonna watch it again my advice to all batman fans is see it rent it lend it from a friend buy it i'd never expect myself to rate this as 9 10 very well done,1
the legendary boris karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in mexico this is the token moody period gothic horror entry from the bunch karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as matthias morteval an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty greedy and backbiting no count relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life sized toy people who populate the place onetime mexican sex symbol andres garcia of tintorera infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character the clunky plodding non direction trite by the numbers script ugly washed out cinematography ridiculous murder set pieces a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon overwrought string score morbid gloom doom atmosphere largely lousy acting karloff notably excepted cheesy mild gore poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm a real campy hoot,1
i don't remember barnaby jones being no more than a very bland standard detective show in which as per any quinn martin show act i was the murder act ii was the lead character figuring out the murder act iii was the plot twist another character murdered act iv was the resolution and the epilogue was betty lee meriwether asking her father in law barnaby jones buddy ebsen how he figured out the crime and then someone saying something witty at the end of the show br br one thing i do remember was the late great composer jerry goldsmith's excellent theme song strangely the opening credit sequence made me want to see the show off and on for the seven seasons the show was on the air i will also admit that it was nice to see ebsen in a role other than jed clampett despite ebsen being badly miscast i just wished the show was more entertaining than when i first remembered it br br update 1 11 2009 i watched an interview with composer jerry goldsmith on youtube through their archive of american television channel let's just say that i was more kind than goldsmith about the show barnaby jones,0
that is quite an outdated movie which aims to showcase the youth's yearning for freedom in some dehumanizing british school oh yes it's like in the army you learn to obey and do what you're asked to yes the young dream of something else but it breaks their dreams and sweeps away their optimism on the threshold of life great br br basically that's how you could sum up the nice intentions in if nice intentions that arouses no cinematographic challenges the result is a declamatory movie do you see how boring i mean br br at least that oldie helped kubrick cast mcdowell in a clockwork orange a movie with a truly powerful social satire and no self indulgent sentimentalism,0
after having seen marrying mafia i'd nearly lost my faith in korean movie business but this one brought my faith back br br leading female character who is university student forced to teach the spoiled rich but charistmatic high school student guy he is actually female character's age through some hilarious quarrells these two end up being great friends br br i was pleasantly surprised that newcomer kwan sang woo did his job with excellency he was such a revelation actress kim ha nul was also charming as usual br br this movie tried hard to avoid any cliches that can be seen in typical romantic comedies and it didn't show us any unnecessary nude sex scenes it was brilliant lovely fresh made me want to see it again br br,1
just finished this movie saw it on the video shelf and being a nick stahl fan i just had to rent it in all honesty it probably should have stayed on the shelf the concept was an interesting one and there were several fairly smart twists and turns but somehow i guessed almost all of them before they came along and the movie just went a little too far in the end in my opinion if you have to suffer through a viewing of it you'll see what i mean br br on a positive note nick stahl's acting was great especially considering what he had to work with eddie kaye thomas was also good but he always plays the same type of character too much paul finch from american pie coming through for my liking br br and finally the worst part of this movie has to be january jones' emotionless performance i guess a pretty face really is all that matters in hollywood,0
steve biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority governed south africa in much the same way as gandhi tried to resist the british empire's colonialism in india richard attenborough's film cry freedom is not about biko or apartheid as much as it is about donald woods the white liberal newspaper editor who risked his life trying to tell biko's story the film has a jarring point of view switch after biko dies in prison from tortuous behavior at the hands of south african police woods played by kevin kline must choose whether to do the right thing and flee the country to publish books about biko or allow his wife played by penelope wilton to pressure him into forgetting about the books in that case biko dies in vain what begins as a life changing friendship between biko and woods degenerates into a standard by the numbers escape over the border yarn after biko's death oscar nominated denzel washington is good in only his fourth film as biko but something is wrong in a film that tries to depict the struggles of apartheid by focusing more on the trials of a white family for more than half the film attenborough would have served his topic better by focusing on biko's rise to prominence instead of beginning where biko befriended woods perhaps a black actor in a leading role in a 2 1 2 hour film wasn't exactly conducive to big box office but the film was a tremendous box office flop anyway film politics aside the film still entertains and sends a message or two albeit in pg sanitized fashion of 4 stars,1
i can't stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton and sure it's his company but you're fired or you're hired for how many seasons now after watching the show i wouldn't want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve br br i'd love to hear just one person get up and say donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo i see he's even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe i hope he gets hurt so i don't have to see his pathetic face anymore it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it i'd give this show a negative mark if i could but it gets a 1 and it doesn't deserve that,0
st elmo's fire has no bearing on life after university at all for the majority of us common folk anyway why was this garbage even made who can really relate to this who lives like these characters i truly feel sorry for the actors having to deal with such a terrible script there are some talented young actors in this film that have done a good job elsewhere it must have just been one whole joke to them on set br br i actually found this film insulting to my intelligence the only joy i got from this is hoping that sir john hughes had a good ol' laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of the breakfast club was released br br don't make the same mistake i did of watching this because you enjoy 80's films it really is that offensive to the genre,0
i would reccomend this film to everyone not only to the fans of the rocker luciano ligabue but to all film buffs because it's sincere moving funny and true because ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover and every frame of his film is made with love and care because his characters are loved and ask to be loved because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one done by an outsider is a real joy to watch and to listen at because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza who was like freccia beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin that ligabue shows as it is unglamorous and ugly without indulging in easy moralisms because it's a film that speaks to our heart our ears our souls and because i lived the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like that thanks luciano,1
the film opens with bill coles melvyn douglas telling a story about how his best friend make that client jim blandings cary grant and his family are tightly packed into a small new york apartment with not enough closet space and way too few bathrooms when jim's wife muriel myrna loy wants to renovate the apartment advertising exec jim falls in love with or falls for an ad for a house once he's purchased the house bills and frustration pile up incessantly as everything that can go wrong with the building of jim's 'dream house' goes wrong br br one of three collaborations between grant and loy this is a charming little comedy not very taxing with no real great message but a great way to spend an hour or two the laughs are there right from the start when the alarm clock goes off and jim tries to shut it off only to be thwarted at every turn by muriel the timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros and that's just what grant and loy give us polished performances simple chemistry and a lot of fun myrna loy is in a pretty thankless role it's evident that grant's character jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting and grant as always pulls both off with remarkable aplomb but she gives muriel a colour life and bite that only myrna loy can give a character melvyn douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well never hitting a single wrong note br br one of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when bill gets himself locked in the 'store room' and jim goes to 'save' him only to get everyone trapped inside every little problem that pops up for the blandings renovation project including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for 'wham' seems to bring together everything that could go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch 8 10,1
another downey must see if you are an obsessed fan like me you have got to see this movie he plays alex finch a 22 year old yale grad who realizes that the life he just came into is the life he left 26 years earlier alex is the re incarnation of louie jeffries a no nonsense lawyer happily married to corrine cybil sheppard louie is killed on their one year anniversary when he is hit by a car he demands to go back only this time in the body of alex finch enter robert downey jr a lot of confusion and a lot of laughs br br although this movie is 15 years old it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as re incarnation and if so how often to you meet the same souls life after life i don't know the answer but i do know that you need to see this movie it is a riot and downey looks so good in a tuxedo this film makes you believe in love and true love never dies it just gets recycled,1
i have found this movie available for streaming on netflix and thought i'd give it a try br br the plot revolves around ryan and theo taylor colm feore and david cubitt who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away ryan and theo at first argue about who did what but later theo finds out that his brother ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness so ryan and theo spend their time patching up their differences br br this is such an incredible film i have only seen colm feore in season 7 of 24 but he was phenomenal in this david cubitt an actor i have never heard of before did a phenomenal job as well br br i would recommend this to those who are interested in the gay and lesbian genre this is one movie you don't want to miss br br i give this film 10 stars out of 10 excellent film,1
what a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be this is the type of film that i've been looking for ages particularly important for me was the fantastic looking chicago which i still keep thinking about the back cover doesn't do this film justice it's superb and in my top 5 for sure,1
this was the worst movie i've ever seen in theaters it was just a compilation of recycled material people getting hit in the head is not funny people getting kicked is not funny after the third time a guy got kicked in the balls not even the youngest audience member was laughing anymore it just got tired fast br br i went with my younger sister she actually laughs out loud at king of the hill but this cinematic masterpiece bored her i'm not surprised the story is pretty lame a midget thief steals a big diamond in what was definitely the easiest heist in hollywood history then he hides out with a family pretending to be a baby i know it sounds exciting but that's the whole story say those two lines over and over for 1 5 hours and you'll get the picture there were predictable jokes galore i really felt ripped off after seeing this i wasn't expecting much and i was still disappointed i wish keenan would just hire some decent writers to write jokes and or his next script this was even worse than white chicks if that is possible i've seen high school plays that were better and cheaper br br there wasn't anything positive about this movie i don't like my entertainment to be dumbed down,0
this game was really great and quite a challenge it has a great spooky story line and the graphics are also very good i would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish the only problem with this game is that i would have liked more weapons but thats just me br br a truly great game for rpg and shoot'em'up fans br br,1
even this early in his career capra was quite accomplished with his camera work and his timing this is a thin story and quite predictable at times but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately the first part looks like a cinderella story though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that the rich 'prince' will lose his fortune br br nonetheless because of his good cast and fast pace it's easy to get caught up in the clichés then the movie does become more original as the married couple have to find a way to make a living the ending is very predictable but satisfying i also want to compliment the title writing very witty and fun,1
i've seen this film because i had do my job includes seeing movies of all kinds i couldn't stop thinking who gave money to make such an awful film and also submit it to cannes festival it wasn't only boring the actors were awful as well it was one of the worst movies i've ever seen,0
there were a lot of things going against this movie for me before i watched it br br first i was a typical high school senior in a shakespeare class i didn't really even like much less understood half of shakespeare would be no more than unintelligible without me pouring all my concentration into his almost encrypted plays encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language and then i still wouldn't get most of it br br second it was 4 hours long i never thought that could be a good thing br br well let me tell you something this movie was so masterful so beautiful i actually understood all the language as it was being performed now the script was followed to the letter in this movie the same script that was incomprehensible to me in shakespeare class and here i was my mind opening and me understanding it i was doubting myself while watching the movie almost but lo and behold when performed and only then shakespeare comes to life so this version of hamlet showed me that shakespeare is indeed a master who wrote great stories when i saw it on the big screen especially in the high budget major motion picture style with beautiful cinematography and photography and acted amazingly by brannagh and cast somehow i understood what was going on what was being said the language is awesome and passionate it allows for more raw emotion when words can't describe something maybe shakespeare's words can br br i still hold to this day that fist of the north star animated english dub is the greatest movie ever made no movie provides more sheer entertainment but for a movie to come close to dethroning fist from that position which hamlet did it came close is truly amazing awe inspiring it wasn't a movie it was an event br br even more amazing it made me appreciate shakespeare wow powerful powerful is the word one of the rare truly powerful movies out there br br this gets 2 hundred trillion stars out of infinity stars yes yes br br by the way all you kids out there in a shakespeare class forget it you're wasting you're time you have to see the plays performed only then will justice be done to them,1
i cannot believe how bad this piece of garbage is i want my 3 99 back words defy description of this poorly made piece of crap the dubbing in no way shape or form aligns with the actor's mouths the movie looks like it was filmed with a 1970's vintage camcorder i have shot better movies with my cell phone camera the gore is laughable due to the silly unbelievable plot the acting is what one would expect if you called all your friends over on a saturday afternoon and proceeded to get completely ripped then tried to put on a play in your garage don't get me wrong i wasn't expecting o'neil and i love zombie movies but the production values are so low in this film as to make it unwatchable avoid,0
i found the dvd version of this movie at a rummage sale the basic premise is an affair between a teacher coach a student the acting is weak and the plot razor thin br br this movie had all the depth and plot development of an adult film,0
not an altogether bad start for the program but what a slap in the face to real law enforcement the worst part of the series is that it attempts to bill itself as reality fare and is anything but men and women that dedicate their lives to the enforcement of laws deserve better than this what is next medical school in a minute charo performing lipo charles grodin assisting on a hip replacement c'mon show a little respect even the citizens of muncie are outing the program as staged police academy high school gym poor editing how many times can they use the car to car shot of the taco bell in the background cheesy siren effects the same loop added ad nauseum to every 'call' whether rolling code or not and last but not least more officer safety issues than you could shake a stick at br br if i want to see manufactured police work and wise ass fake cops i would watch reno 911,0
a pretty worthless made for television movie that pretty much follows the killer insect script ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel i think it is from the hotel food because the sewage from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the ant bed there is a lack of suspense in this film and it is not scary either watching a bunch of ants sting their victims is not very terrifying br br spoilers section the stupidity of the hero is near incredible he is told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero it has to be a mysterious virus after the inspector says this the hero takes his bulldozer and wrecks the huge ant colony this disturbs the millions of ants and traps the people in the hotel br br end spoilers overall this movie is extremely lame i don't understand why it got a dvd release when so many deserving movies have none my only guess for the dvd release is that suzanne summers is featured in the film this is a movie to avoid,0
this is an awesome classic monster flick from the 50's i just love the look of the 50's in general like the cars and the music anyway i love the way the blob looks i love when the everyone is at the late night horror flick at the theater and the blob comes in and crashes the party another thing i love about it is that it takes place all in one night just like halloween ii br br when steve and jane are making out they see a meteor fall from space inside the meteor is the blob whenever the blob consumes a person it grows bigger and bigger they try to convince the people of the town about the blobby monster but no one believes them until later can anything stop this blobby creature i highly recommend the blob,1

sure star wars a movie i have seen at least fifty times beats all the others in special effects but this film has every thing else br br it has horror non graphical romance robots witty repartee intelligence surprisingly good special effects and drama br br i saw this film a couple of years ago in a revival with a newly struck print and i was amazed at how well it held up today i thought the old 40's style electronics would look hokey but they somehow looked futuristic and moderne br br ann francis in here mostly short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to beat still gets a rise out of me br br the krell monster appearing in the ray beams still scares the bejebees out of me br br of course we all know that the great bird of the galaxy probably modeled much of star trek from this movie br br no one has yet to beat robby the robot in terms of personality br br sorry r2d2 and c3po br br this movie overall is the standard that all other science fiction films will have to measure up to br br honorable mention for the haunting electronic score which kept us all on pins and needles,1
i have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film i even got the rental company to give me my money back because i argued that they perpetrated false advertising br br it's not enough that the movie itself is a p o s but the cover art is what sold me i've done better make up effects on my children at halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art can you say raccoon eyes br br i'm not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details but come on the movie's main character is an l a cop who was born and raised in alabama but has a german accent it's beyond insulting,0
it's been about 14 years since sharon stone awarded viewers a leg crossing that twisted many people's minds and now god knows why she's in the game again basic instinct 2 is the sequel to the smash hit erotica basic instinct featuring a sexy stone and a vulnerable michael douglas however fans of the original might not even get close to this one since instinct 2 is painful film making as the mediocre director michael caton jones assassinates the legacy of the first film br br the plot of the movie starts when a car explosion breaks in right at the beginning catherine tramell sharon stone trying to look forcefully sexy is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder a psychiatrist a horrible david morrisey is appointed to examine her but eventually falls for an intimate game of seduction br br and there it is without no further explanations the basic force that moves this instinct nothing much is explained and we have to sit through a sleazy c class erotic film sharon stone stars in her first role where she is most of the time a turn off part of it because of the amateurish writing the careless direction and terrifyingly low chemistry the movie is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality a menage a trois scene was cut off so that this wouldn't be rated nc 17 than the first entrance in the series instinct is a compelling torture br br to top it off everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the film the acting here is really bad sharon stone has some highlights but here she gets extremely obnoxious david morrisey stars in the worst role of his life and seems to never make more than two expressions in the movie confused and aroused instinct 2 is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series that managed to put in thriller with erotica extremely well paul verhoeven how i miss you br br basic instinct 2 never sounded like a good movie and indeed it isn't some films should never get out of paper and that is the feeling you get after watching this now it is much easier to understand why douglas and david cronenberg dropped out and why sharon stone was expecting a huge paycheck for this 3 10,0
i have previously seen zu warriors from the magic mountain in that film the setting takes place in china's mountains the legend of zu looks like another dimension thank that to tsui hark's extensive use of cgi effects he's able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds a land where beings fly freely and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades split swords and the ultra cool moon orb br br while there are many characters in this one the focus is mainly on king sky and enigma the romance aspect is there although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor cecilia cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching in the beginning i like how she resembles the countess from zu warriors and she does well playing enigma as she deals with facing her past life oh by the way did i mention that cecilia's very appealing to the eye br br in truth zu warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 tsui hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema,1
it really boggles my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst slasher films out there this is by far not one of the worst out there still not a good movie but not the worst nonetheless go see something like death nurse or blood lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the night brings charlie is the worst the film has decent camera work and editing which is way more than i can say for many more extremely obscure slasher films br br the film doesn't deliver on the on screen deaths there's one death where you see his pruning saw rip into a neck but all other deaths are hardly interesting but the lack of on screen graphic violence doesn't mean this isn't a slasher film just a bad one br br the film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously the film came in at the end of the second slasher cycle so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements done in a tongue in cheek way for example after a kill charlie goes to the town's 'welcome' sign and marks the population down one less this is something that can only get a laugh br br if you're into slasher films definitely give this film a watch it is slightly different than your usual slasher film with possibility of two killers but not by much the comedy of the movie is pretty much telling the audience to relax and not take the movie so god darn serious you may forget the movie you may remember it i'll remember it because i love the name,0
a pretty average scifi film the plot was more or less obvious from the start although the acting was reasonably good the writing seemed very cliched using ideas taken from numerous films br br the basic plot scientists working on a deep space research platform rescue a fighter from crashing into the red dwarf that they have been orbitting onboard they find a stasis pod which coincidently malfunctions at that very moment after 2 or 3 minutes of the man in the pod waking up you realise that he is a complete lunatic something which totally escapes the 3 person crew of the research ship br br after that it becomes a rip off every other film involving a psychotic madman terrorising innocent victims overall i think speed 2 was a better exploration of the subject matter which i didn't consider to be a good film either br br not a good film get aliens out and watch that again br br,0
what could be more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women they're supposed to be spying on and most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banal br br but the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense you can see real people behind the unreal lines and the directing is wonderful each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too long br br i showed this to several friends in the mid 80s because i was perplexed at how such bad material could be made into such a good movie the friends enjoyed it too,1
i've loved this movie ever since it first came out i was about nine years old and now i'm 27 i remember playing the video game on sega genisis i had so much fun i would love to show my son this movie he likes michael jackson as well and i know he will love this movie just as i did when i was a kid even though he's much younger than i was when i first saw it i can't wait for it to come out on dvd i hope it comes out on dvd please let it come out on dvd i'm dying to see it again well that is my comment i hope that one day soon i'll get to view this movie again i love all of the videos in this movie my favorite mini video is badder,1
this was a truly insipid film the performances are third rate and the dialogue is so stilted that at times it seemed to have just rolled over and died my reason for renting this was simple find a movie with scriptwriting i needed a visual aid for my presentation so i figured why not use a clip boy was i wrong after searching my local video store i came upon this where it was suspiciously titled starstruck i thought what the hey and decided to give it a try well i was very unhappy with my results there was maybe one scene i could use and meanwhile i was practically falling asleep because of the sheer banality of the flick so i took this back and picked up ed wood there's a movie i can use as an example then again anything would be presentable compared to the drivel that is starfucker,0
it's really unfortunate that most people outside of canada think that the only things that canada produces are snow mounties and hockey players this film is the second superlative canadian film i have seen within the past few weeks the first was the red violin far better than all but the best hollywood efforts br br gustad noble is anything but that he is a middle aged parsi bank employee in bombay in the 1970s this film sensitively explores various things that happen to him concerning his family his friends and his work and their effect on him at the same time it is a fascinating and i would assume accurate portrayal of middle class urban life in india at the time br br however i was somewhat prepared for this having read rohinton mistry's book a few years ago the film as might be expected cannot capture all the complexities of the book but if you want to read a really good book and see a really good film read and see such a long journey,1
why did the histories of mary and rhoda have to be so dour divorced women with indifferent daughters and why very little reference to the original show and characters the daughter characters were silly and uninteresting why can't there ever be daughters who like their mother's on tv it makes sense that mary would leave minneapolis and rhoda would return to nyc but why couldn't phyllis or sue ann nivens be guest stars it just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters it was good to see mary and rhoda together of course but it could have been better much better well there has been a mary tyler moore show reunion a dick van dyke show reunion hopefully mary will do better next time if she revisits her old mary richards stomping grounds again,0
the thumb idea isn't such a winner the second time round thumbtanic wasn't as good as thumb wars for a number of reasons primarily i think mr oedekerk had far less to work with in the titanic send up unlike star wars the movie titanic hasn't yet become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made which will resonate with the audience br br in thumbtanic the holes are filled by one off jokes which don't really seem related to anything for example the hero's insinuation that the heroine isn't clean during the jump off end of ship scene it's not funny rather you just think to yourself did i miss something in the original movie there were too many of these type of baseless jokes cf arachnid br br by contrast the send up of the smarmy ship's designer had meaning and was funny also very funny was the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go faster as a maniac running around demanding everything be faster including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die these sort of jokes meant something in the titanic context and lent meaningful humour to thumbtanic br br the thumb media the faces and the voices are still amusing the props and sets and the cg animation are worthy of appreciation overall although thumbtanic proves that quirkiness alone won't work this filmette still keeps you amused and chuckling to the end,0
i actually saw this movie in the theater back in it's original release it was painful to watch peter sellers embarrass himself so badly the story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow and the ending was ridiculous it was just sad to see how the mighty had fallen i won't say that i'm a huge peter sellers fan but i did thoroughly enjoy the pink panther series and i felt that he gave a strong performance in being there but this film should never have been made from what i've read he pursued producing this film against the advice of the people around him fine but that still doesn't excuse the studio actually releasing the film,0
i saw this in the theater when it came out and just yesterday i saw it again on cable this i was able to reacquainted myself with the feeling of just how revolting this film is the whole bunch of characters are self absorbed narcisstic preeners worst of all it reinforces every negative stereotype about 20 something dating even as it purports to celebrate people finding themselves the nice guys finish last the jerky guys make out great the jerkiest guys do best the girls are all boy toy pushovers only one character wendy is seen doing anything remotely useful to society and she dispenses with her long saved virginity in a throwaway one night stand with a scumbag in a lushly filmed scene that we're supposed to think is romantic what this really is is hollywood's concept of young america permissive detached promiscuous conceited,0
the fourth in the dirty harry series this film features one of the most despicable ugliest unlikable profane disgusting females i have ever seen on film ray perkins played by audrie neenan she is the modern nasty low life version of the 1945 detour character ann savage br br her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much i never watched this film again until i acquired a profanity filter which shut her up and least some of her then i could enjoy the rest of the movie br br everywhere harry callahan clint eastwood goes violence immediately follows within minutes it happens so often it's almost laughable but it makes for a fast moving entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one by one br br this is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts and connects sad to say most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end and who does it better than dirty harry,1
when i was younger i liked this show but now blecch this show is sappy badly written and rarely funny the three leads were all good actors and funny men saget's stand up was a lot better than the stuff this show came up with as was coulier a better stand up and stamos was a better than average actor after a while stamos wanted off the show because it wanted to do more serious stuff who could blame him the show eventually got cancelled when many of the actors demanded more money br br here are a few things that drive me crazy about the show br br 1 the catch phrases how many times can one person put up with tiring catch phrases like with 'how rude' 'you got it dude' 'nerdbomber' 'cut it out' and 'have mercy' in a 24 hour time period br br 2 kimmy gibler the most annoying character ever written for television br br 3 the writing stale and cliched as an oreo cookie there is good cliched writing and bad cliched writing full house had bad cliched writing br br 4 three men living together in san francisco enough said br br 5 unrealistic stuff too much to recall br br 6 trendy kids the girls had all the latest mall fashions and you can see posters of trendy recording artists they would be into br br now this show is on nick nite i would hardly call it a classic i have nothing bad to say about the people involved since i think many of them are talented in their own right but this show was just so sugary sweet i couldn't stand it after a while,0
recently i saw the documentary the revolution will not be televised also know as chávez inside the coup at first i thought it showed a genuine inside view of events during the venezuela coup of april 2002 what bothered me though was the fact that the tone of the narration and the accompanying music were suggestive and that at no point any criticism was expressed about hugo chávez this is peculiar because if a documentary is giving an non biased account of what happened there should have been some of that too after all chávez certainly is not a saint fortunately since the documentary is several years old a lot of additional information is available on the internet nowadays and it was not difficult to find for instance urgent investigation about chavez the coup by the 5 european tv corporations who financed the film which presents blatant falsehoods about venezuela it lists the many errors and intended or unintended falsifications in the documentary just use the title as a search string in google you will find it another interesting document was the video registration of a presentation of the findings of the many errors in this documentary x ray of a lie to me it seems to be a good counterweight to chávez inside the coup it's available at video google i strongly advice you after watching chávez inside the coup to look at x ray of a lie and then form your opinion my conclusion is that kim bartley and donnacha o'brian were knowingly or not part in chávez propaganda,0
for all of the has beens or never was's or for the curious this film is for you ever played a sport or wondered what it felt like after the lights went down and the crowd left this film explores that and more br br robin williams jack dundee is a small town assistant banker in taft ca whose life has been plagued by a miscue in a big rival high school football game 13 years ago when he dropped the pass that would have won over bakersfield their arch rival that takes great pleasure in pounding the taft rockets season after season kurt russell reno hightower was the quarterback in that famous game and is the local legend that now is a van repair specialist whose life is fading into lethargy like the town of taft itself br br williams gets an idea to remake history by replaying the game he meets with skeptical resistance so he goes on a one man terror spree and literally paints the town orange yellow and black to raise the ire of the residents to recreate the game after succeeding the players from that 1972 team reunite and try to get in shape to practice which is hysterical the game is on bakesfield is loaded with all of the high tech gadgets game strategies and sophisticated training routines taft is drawing plays in the mud with sticks stones and bottle caps what a riot does taft overcome the odds does robin willians purge the demons from his bowels does kurt russell rise from lethargy watch the best of times for one of the best viewing experiences ever br br one of robin williams best understated performances the chemistry between robin and russell is magic and who is kid lester br br holly palance and pamela reed give memorable performances as the wives of williams and russell succeeds on many levels a 10,1
having decided some time ago to collect the films of billy bob thornton on the strength of class movies like sling blade a simple plan and the man who wasn't there amongst others it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there what i didn't realise however was that there could be one this bad i'll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is the funniest dialogue in it goes like this knock knock who's there the big stinking man the big stinking man who the big stinking man is you yes folks it really is that bad billy bob is only in it for about two minutes i guess he needed the work at that time in his career and the rest of the movie is painful for some reason though although it's undeniably awful i don't hate it that's probably because i save my ire for any high budget special effects laden junk like the fast and the furious and not a no budget flick like this one 2 10 at a push,0
tight script good direction excellent performances strong cast effective use of locations br br paul mcgann gives a detailed subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously br br there is an interesting moral emotional journey happening with his character ben turner and it intersects with the journey undertaken by amanda burton inevitably they cross over who has done what br br the examination of why both in the past and in the present rather than who might have yielded a more interesting dostoyevskian story but hey who's complaining br br,1
oh this was a really bad movie the girl who plays jennifer is ok but i think she acts bitchy through the movie not because she is having her organs ripped out by a raven at night but because she is thinking of firing her agent for putting her in this piece of crap faye dunaway acts like she is remaking mommy dearest and the ending is completely silly i really can't recommend this movie at all even though as a fan of edgar allen poe i was intrigued a bit by the references to his work ravens house of usher like family curse and being buried alive still he would probably turn over in his grave if he knew about this film,0
the sarah silverman program is better than those other shows no laugh tracks no painful jokes just a program the sarah silverman program if you're like me and you love comedy this is probably a show for you br br sarah silverman brings out there funny and right here funny to the table with ease a mix of different styles which makes for its own br br this program isn't something you want to start a compare war with seeing as how it has absolutely nothing to do with them other shows this show is its own entity and i think most comedy heads will like it just fine br br go watch and see,1
i remember when the golden child was released in 1986 it was universally panned by the critics and i m talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of eddie murphy so i guess this movie has something going for it br br it gets off to a bad start where buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face bad guys enter the temple br br child sits with blank expression br br bad guys chop up the monks br br child sits with blank expression br br bad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with go on guess you do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at michael jackson s wonderland ranch he d still give the same blank expression this movie would be better titled the wooden child br br the title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening in fact that s the main problem and boy it s a serious one with this movie the whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together i blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too did anyone know before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be it s part fantasy part martial arts part buddy movie part comedy and it s all crap,0
we loved the movie i am a mother to two little men i love having a movie i can watch with them where men have integrity and character moveis where money is not the most important thing and family's are forever and love means more then words br br i do wish we saw more of the davis family but over all i loved it left me with the same feeling the others did please don't be over we both wish actors would not change the new actors were good replacement tho br br my 9 year old son loved this movie too asked me to go buy them all he is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something family should all see this move buy it for friends help bring back a time of values we will be reading the books now that we are hooked really hope to see more be blessed happy moving,1
i loved this film i thought it would be easy to watch and easy to forget i ran out after watching this to buy the dvd obv not easily forgotten br br the script is brilliant and the casting couldn't be more perfect each character has their moment and i laughed hard throughout this film comedic timing was spot on br br,1
i'll come clean the only reason i even found out about this dvd was because dominic monaghan is a favorite actor of mine when i heard the title of the film i thought it was going to be different perhaps in not such a good way br br but i was wrong after reading what few reviews were out there about this short i was actually excited about seeing it i sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later needless to say i was not disappointed br br the film follows jack a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality and what is all in his head i won't give away what happens but i will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in it's realism br br the directing is fantastic focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thought provoking moments br br all in all i give this great film 9 out of 10 for going far beyond what i thought any short could achieve,1
having never seen the original dirty harry i judged this movie on a clean slate and i must say i quite enjoyed it sure some of the acting by sondre locke made me a little squeemish but hey it was the 80's but even if you can't get past her and i almost couldn't or her revenge killings which seemed a little overdone p it's worth it just for dirty harry or at the very least the bull dog he affectionately names 'meathead' p br br 7 10,1
when i started watching this movie i saw the dude from buffy xander and figured ah how nice that he's still making a living acting in movies now a weird movie i can stand given that it's a good dose of weird like for example david lynch movies twin peaks lost highway etc and you sort of have to be in the mood for one this one however made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about there about conspiracy theory's that make absolutely no sense i mean come on people nazi's who conspire with america to make an unholy trinity of evil powers i was surprised they didn't mention the hollow earth in this movie with hitler flying saucers and lizard people maybe if you had like 60 grams of heroine with this movie it would make some sort of sense but seriously i don't condone drugs like i don't condone this movie it should be burned shredded and forgotten just so good ol' xander might get another acting job it wasn't his acting though that was alright but the script just didn't make any sense sorry,0
no this is nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach fairy godmother and the glass slippers but if i were to elaborate i would have to spoil it for you which i won't but don't let curiosity get the better of you as this movie is not fantastic it's one of those movies that start off promisingly before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent storyline and that's real horror br br yoon hee to ji won and hyun soo shin se kyeong are your ideal mother and daughter one's a successful plastic surgeon while the other your dutiful obedient and beautiful teenage daughter their relationship is like hand in glove so close you'd think of them more as siblings rather than parent child but things start to go wrong don't they always when hyun soo's friends whom yoon hee has operated on start to go berserk br br perhaps it's a warning to audiences and for those koreans ladies who don't bat an eyelid when going under the knife if news reports are to be believed the only truly scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery though somehow i thought kim ki duk's time actually had more gore when featuring and describing what goes on during the surgery itself br br it's a tale of two halves the fist being an attempt to shock audiences with standard scare tactics which i admit did get to me now and then however the second half degenerated the movie into mindless mumbo jumbo melodramatics and was quite contrived into its forcing its ideas down your throat some things begin not to make sense and while attempts are always presented to explain you probably won't buy it not that horror movies are logical to begin with br br the leads are all beautiful and there is a distinct lack of male presence besides the negligible cop role but hey i'm not complaining though the storyline could have been improved tremendously i'd recommend you to watch this only if you're a fan of mediocre korean horror on vcd watch out for those face off ish moments,0
while not as bad as it has been made to be i have seen much worse this is still a very lame movie basically a rehash of siegel's coogan's bluff with the main difference being that clint eastwood's hat has more charisma than the whole of joe don baker an unappealing actor if there was one br br however venantino venantini is great and great fun as the bad guy sort of a budget vittorio gassman he is the main reason to sit through this steampile as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible acting specially the girl poor old rossano brazzi hard to believe he was once a romantic lead watch mondo cane to see him running away from women looking here like a second tier ben gazzara he's given next to nothing to do it's all joe don's show unfortunately and all of it scored to generic 80's action movie music that couldn't be more boring br br greydon clark can make good b movies without warning but here he trips falls breaks his nose and loses three teeth well at least the malta locations were nice and there's venantini to try to save the day 3 10,0
rounding out the 1929 30 all talkie our gang release schedule a tough winter features two storylines first wheezer and mary ann home alone on a wintry day decide to make some taffy little wheezer relays the directions to mary ann from a radio cooking show the problem wheezer relays information from different shows and mary ann ends up putting soap in the mix funny moments occur when the rest of the gang shows up to pull the taffy and end up getting it all over the house br br the second storyline deals with stepin fetchit a neighbor handyman of the gang and his interactions with the gang br br a tough winter to my knowledge has never been shown on television although it is available on home video the reason for this is the stepin fetchit characterization which shows a shifty sly and slow moving character our gang producer hal roach called fetchit a skilled comic and used this our gang entry as a pilot for a fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day understandably fetchit's characterization is offensive to many people today which explains why the film has been shelved br br although there are some funny moments both with fetchit and the taffy a tough winter is a plodding and meandering effort if one positive came out of this film it was that the hal roach studios grew confident and experienced in making talkies the sound in the film is good and some of the sound effects used are very funny for this reason this film in part paved the way for the excellent 1930 31 our gang films br br 3 out of 10,0

just a dumb old movie first stanwyck's son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way in an effort to save him stanwyck gets unlucky yet again and comes across an escaped convict she has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way in the end her husband is saved and stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is all's well than ends dumb br br i could never figure out how an unattractive woman like stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in hollywood's glamour oriented golden era that nose is so beautiful so photogenic the film is mercifully short running a little over an hour it's as though the director sensed that he was making crap so he thought it best to keep the crap short,0
white fire was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate dvd releases and on vhs he claimed it's one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made i generally don't watch movies knowing that they're going to be bad but i made an exception for this one and i was very glad that i did br br it's filled to the brim with action much of it surprisingly graphically gory sleaze isolated to nudity with a key female character but there's so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious and outrageously awkward dialogue all of which adds to the laughter inducing tone of the film br br ginty the unusual looking star of the exterminator and countless other low budget action turds is amusing in the lead giving the best performance he could muster williamson is better than usual clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee and he doesn't come in until midway through the rest of the cast is also fun to watch particularly the villains one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that appears to be a mish mash of spanish and italian she's priceless br br again i can't stress enough how gory it was it's not so bloody that it's nauseating but it's uncommonly violent in parts with some meaty squibs going off in the shootouts and it has a grueling torture sequence that no man will soon forget also when ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guys he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and spilling their beers br br don't miss white fire it's a rollicking if mind numbingly stupid action classic,1
the film looks super on paper a romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic cross breeding gold especially with this excellent romcomic cast br br i'm afraid lawrence kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they duly go and hang themselves adam brooks' script may well be to blame but you'd expect better from the kevin kline of a fish called wanda instead the two ping pong off one another and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason either of them are in and dashing around france br br jean reno co stars amiably as the cop with a heart and i guess wishes he was a star with a part mind you he went on to do those pink panther remake s so perhaps he was ok with this 3 10,0
this movie is great it touched my stone cold heart i couldn't relate about the racial discrimination that antwone has experienced because i'm living in my own country i guess it is really hard to be discriminated br br we watched this film in our sociology class in new era university and i didn't knew that it was a true story i thought it was just created by an intellectual who want to bring a fresh air in the industry it is very good br br the part that shocked me was when nadine abused antwone who was just six sexually if i were on his shoes i could have jumped a ten story high building i salute him for he being so strong br br the scene that touched me here is when antwone finally saw his mother eva face to face he did not bitched her or whatever instead he told her about the achievements that he got within the long years that they have been separated i think i'll do that when i get the chance of tracing my roots,1
just finished watching can't say i was impressed br br it starts of quite good the visual and the atmosphere gives a creepy feeling as this type of movie should but it all ends when the first lordi monster appears not only do you recognize them from the band lordi but they are seriously malplaced in the movie doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are so 80's br br as for the storyline it starts of as similar horror movies people trapped inside a hell hole but there is no clear story on why and what is happening the viewer is thrown some lines on possible reasons but the lines never meet and end up to anything but a mess br br with all the money spent on this film with an intriguing start and some good effects i had thought someone would have taken better care of the product i wonder if lordi made this movie just to prove that their show costumes could be scary except they aren't br br so the movie gets cred for the visuals i guess the money had to go somewhere but the rest is an embarrassing attempt from a rock band to make their on stage monster aliases scarier,0
while rome goes mad celebrating hitler's visit uniforms bands parades two outsiders stay home in a large building and wind up meeting she is sofia loren who is the wife of brutish public servant and mother of six children he is mastroianni a radio speaker who's been fired because of his homosexuality both of them need company and understanding both f them find it in each other br br the movie covers a span of a few hours the color are faded and everything takes place with a sound track of military marches and hysterical radio announcers strangely enough the nazi anthem the horst wessel lied ends up becoming a romantic musical theme br br beautiful movie excellent recreation of a special era in italian history and a touching sad story mastroianni is as good as we have come to expect and sofia loren does a superb job very far away from her usual truck driver's pin up neapolitan fishwife personas don't miss it,1
channel surfing and caught this on logo it was one of those i have to watch this because it's so horribly bad moments like roadhouse without the joy the writing is atrocious completely inane and the acting is throw up in your mouth bad br br there's low budget and then there is the abyss which is where this epic should be tossed and never seen from again i mean the main characters go to a ski retreat in some rented house and the house is well ordinary which is no big deal but they choose to show all the houseguests pouring over it like it was the sistine chapel i'm sorry but watching 6 guys stare into every 10'x10' boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame i guess they didn't learn anything from the bad news bears in breaking training see hotel room check scene wow a toilet yaayyyyy i don't buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine if it smells like and it looks like well you know the rest br br avoid like the plague br br edit apparently other more close minded reviewers believe that since i disliked this movie i am an obvious hater which i can only assume means i am phobic which of course is not true i decided to do this wacky crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the film and not by its mere presence i e its refreshing to see br br sure it may be refreshing to see but that doesn't equate into a great movie just give them some better material to work with and tighter direction in fact i applaud the effort frankly i'd rather go listen to my kitchens of distinction catalogue than watch this again,0
this is probably karisma at her best apart from zubeidaa nana patekar also gives out his best without even trying the story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag especially when shahrukh comes in the picture what really made me like it were the performances of the leads the dialog delivery as well as the story for what it was it could've been directed better and edited the supporting case was even great including karima's mother in law even though she just had one shining moment it was great to watch her br br the sets were also pretty good i didn't really like their portrayal of a canadian family but once they step in india it's as real as it gets br br overall i would give it a thumbs up,1
dull cheap sci fi thriller made with an almost total lack of conviction a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from outer space is run by only one man and is very poorly guarded at night and full of campy sound effects christopher lee is not only wasted but he also gives one of his few i'm here strictly for the money performances 1 2,0
jane eyre is one of the greatest novels in the english language and this screenwriter should of read it i hate it when writers use spark notes for what a novel is all about this movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book br br the whole 'red room' is so down played that i wonder why they even bother to put it in in the book the 'red room' is foreshadowing for the whole story and the rest of jane's life helen burns is treated so badly in the movie i'm sure she was happy to die and leave early in the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head the whole christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie br br do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as charlotte bronte masterfully told it,0
well i gave this movie a 7 it was better than thirdspace but not as good as in the beginning as far as the b5 movies go i really think the television series did a much better job overall with the special effects and character portrayal let's hope the producers and cast get the next series crusade up to the standards of b5,1
i saw this movie sunday afternoon i absolutely loved this movie i loved everything about it from the sappy moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where mamie gummer lila is crying because of her poor decision in marrying a man for her parents and not because she is truly in love i loved these moments because they were just so real at first i was seriously scared because i was hoping that it would not end up like bobby which was a great cast but a poorly written movie with no real meat to it but during the middle of the movie i felt completely different you will laugh and you will cry but in the end you will want to see evening one more time trust me when i say go see it,1
a lot of the comments people have made strike me as sorry missing the point kasdan wants to present life simply ordinary life the conventionally structured story where characters have insights that change their lives and then fade out music up and the film is over is absorbed into this much larger canvas several characters in this movie have just such illuminations and then they move on sometimes they can hold onto their insights sometimes they can't and that's the way life really is in other words kasdan jettisons conventional dramatic structure in favor of an exploration of the the ongoingness of life  there is no happy ending only an eventual ending and everything before that is still in process still always up for grabs  and if you absolutely insist on a theme an exploration of the role of the miraculous in our lives what is a miracle well life itself for a start then add in all the random incidents and cross connections that make up a life or several interconnected lives and you have miracles by the bucketful kasdan underscores this theme lightly rather than insisting on it and bolsters it in various ways most memorably by the device right in the center of the film of having mac and his wife lying in bed each dreaming their own dreams but as well showing later on in the film how those dreams have the power within the film to shape reality this is not a film with an easy or obvious message you just have to let it play out in front of you and then let it sit in your mind for a few days a month a few years and see what it has wrought there this is without a doubt kasdan's best film his most mature his most humane a major meditation on life from one of our most gifted writers and directors the tragedy is of course that he has not been allowed to work for a number of years now mostly due to studio constraints around dreamcatcher hopefully we haven't heard the last from larry kasdan a great film from a great artist keep in mind that art does not have to rationalize itself completely in order to succeed,1
the story centers around barry mckenzie who must go to england if he wishes to claim his inheritance being about the grossest aussie shearer ever to set foot outside this great nation of ours there is something of a culture clash and much fun and games ensue the songs of barry mckenzie barry crocker are highlights,1
monstervision was a show i grew up with from late night hosting with penn and teller to the one the only joe bob briggs the show kept me up friday nights back in my high school years and provided some of the best drive in memories to ever come outside of the drive in br br without a doubt the best late night television ever if you didn't stay up you were missing out br br i know john bloom and joe bob live on but i want them back where they belong monstervision question did anyone else sit through all 4 hours of the swarm q br br long live monstervision,1
the early career of abe lincoln is beautifully presented by ford not that anyone alive has seen footage of the real lincoln but fonda wearing a fake nose is uncanny as lincoln with the voice delivery walk and other mannerisms exactly as one would imagine lincoln to have been ford in the first of three consecutive films he made with fonda is at the top of his form perfectly evoking early 19th century america the story focuses on a pair accused of murder that lincoln defends and the courtroom scenes are quite well done the supporting cast includes many of ford's regulars this was alice brady's last film as she died months after its release,1
full house is a great show i am still today growing up on it i started watching it when i was 8 and now i am 12 and still watching it i fell in love with all of the characters especially stephanie she is my favorite she had such a sense of humor in case there are people on this sight that hardly watch the show you should because you will get hooked on it i became hooked on it after the first show i saw which just happened to be the first episode in 2002 it really is a good show i really think that this show should go down to many generations in families and it's great too because it is an appropriate show for all ages and for all parents it teaches kids lessons on how to go on with their life nothing terrible happens like violence or swearing it is just a really great sit com i give it 5 out of 5 stars what do you think oh and the best time to watch it is when you are home sick from school or even the old office it will make you feel a lot better trust me i am hardly home sick but i still know that it will make you feel better and to everybody that thinks the show is stupid well that's too bad for you because you won't get as far in life even if you are happy with your life you really should watch it and you will get hooked on it i am just telling you what happened to me and everybody else that started watching this awesome show well i need must go to have some lunch remember you must start watching full house and soon,1
had never heard of the man in the moon until seeing it last evening on this hdtv channel look my taste is like any others' eclectic my favorites run from blue velvet to dr strangelove to the ghost and mrs muir thru the wizard of oz and the loved one eraserhead repo man and the spy within br br the man in the moon is superbly made a gentle hearted joyous and tragic film beautifully filmed one in which the actors truly live in the moment rather than act this sweet tale shortly will be in our private library this beautiful story of life in a far finer era in rural louisiana literally transports you to its pastoral setting br br it's hard to remain stoic during the film's last moments particularly when the young girl the extent of her older sister's heart searing private pain and forgives all br br rather than spoil the enjoyment or bore you to sobs with my dull prose will end now with this suggestion from one who enjoys films which speak from the heart to ours br br if you purchase no other film please purchase the man in the moon this moving story is one you'll enjoy reliving time and again it is a joy and a gem a film all too scarce in this world of hardening hearts br br the simple virtues evinced in man in the moon are a joy to behold br br paul vincent zecchino br br manasota key florida br br 05 april 2009,1
i enjoy all the versions of this story but this one is my all time favorite george c scott gives a depth to the scrooge character that the others do not give the movie shows more about why he becomes so bitter the changes in scrooge appear gradually as he encounters the different ghosts and the incidents that they show him br br this movie has the best tiny tim by far he is the right age rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager as in the other films anthony walters still has all or most of his baby teeth br br david warner is wonderful as bob cratchit he is such a versatile actor he portrays a man who clearly loves his family he plays the role with dignity neither as a wimpy man cowering under scrooges'thumb but as a man who gracefully puts up with it because he has a family to provide for susannah york and the other actors do a fine job of bringing the characters to life edward woodward is the best ghost of christmas present i've ever seen most often he is played as a jolly santa type character in this he shows anger at scrooges attitudes and really makes scrooge reconsider br br the costumes and the sets really bring the london of dickens time to life a wonderful movie,1
a film so insecure the creaters perhaps hoped to milk an original film noir classic title farewell my lovely thinking the gullible would assume it a remake the characters are so foul and unappealing that it deserved its cold reception when first released time only adds to it its absurdity having none of the guile cinematography desperation or despair of classic noir it relied instead on a convoluted and senseless crime plot that would have easily resulted in several arrests within hours as if that weren't enough it threw in an utterly sexless attempt at erotica in which at least one of the participants hadn't bothered to bathe in several days this only made this mess all the more painful to watch find a good classic forties or fifties film noir instead of wasting two hours on this failure,0
if you enjoy the subtle yes i said subtle actions and reactions of john candy you can't help but like this film pronounced fillum by salvatore dipasquale the unobservant and uninformed watcher always saw candy as a broad actor a big buffoon and sometimes he was see stripes and splash but when given the opportunity he could really be razor sharp and quite subtle it's too bad he was cast in so many roles that only showed his broad side because we'll never get to see more of the other oh yeah the movie one can watch going berserk over and over i know i have with the frequency of caddyshack it's just that good the plot although a little convoluted is actually fairly deep for a farce of this kind it allows candy and the always under rated joe flaherty and eugene levy to bounce off of candy and they bounce hard definitely worth a glance for anyone who enjoyed sctv or candy's other work,1
made only ten years after the actual events and set in the bunker under the reichstag pabst's film is wholly gripping it reeks of sulfurous death awaiting the perpetrators of world war haven't seen this in over three decades but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory the characters seem to be waiting to be walled up in their cave searing bit of dialog between two generals does god exist if he did we wouldn't shame this is not more readily available for exhibition or purchase because it would be interesting to view and compare this film with the documentary about traudl junge im toten winkel aka blind spot hitler's secretary and downfall with bruno ganz,1
it was simple and yet so nice i think the whole sense of sex segregation in society which can be bitter was shown very delicately it had a bitter kind of hummer in it the fact that most of the actors were not professionals made the movie more tangible and more realistic there was a documentary side to the movie too the best scenes were those that all the girls banned from watching were listening passionately to the soldier who is supposed to keep an eye on them broadcasting the game if you are an iranian the familiar cheering and dancing in the streets after a game won fills you up with national pride if you are not iranian you'll still love it all the same,1
okay i've tried and i've tried but i still don't get this guy maddin thing tales from the gimli hospital left me cold that movie about the austrian villagers and the one about the ice nymph were pretty to look but lacking in the story department and this nudie movie about abortion and hockey is just boring i'm glad maddin has an appreciation for silent film but i dislike his films for the same reason i dislike the films of quentin tarantino they're empty homages to better more imaginative films films that advanced the art form or broke new ground and are all style and no substance no amount of jump cuts and odd camera angles can disguise the fact that maddin is an unoriginal david lynch wannabe though he does have one advantage over tarantino he generally doesn't write embarrassing dialogue because most of his films rely on intertitles the bottom line is maddin's schtick is clever clever film making for aspiring film majors,0
the national gallery of art showed the long thought lost original uncut version of this film on july 10 2005 it restores vital scenes cut by censors upon its release the character of the cobbler a moral goody goody individual in the original censored release of 1933 is here presented as a follower of the philosopher nietsze and urges her to use men to claw her way to the top also the corny ending of the original which i assume is in current vhs versions is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form a wonderful film of seduction and power hopefully there will a reissue of this film on dvd for all to appreciate its great qualities look for it,1
resnais wow the genius who brought us hiroshima mon amour takes on the challenge of making a 1930s french musical in vibrant colour the opening voice over with old embellished inter titles was a nice touch then the camera aperture opens like the old hand crankers on a black white placard the camera backs off or rather up suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party this is all in the first 60 seconds br br then the music starts a rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film and yes i speak french so i can't blame it on the subtitles those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song then they leave and finally audrey tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minutes into the film br br i'm not sure what resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time musical cacophony but the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out i endured br br it didn't get much better i'll tell you why there is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters we don't even see their faces half the time as resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera people flit on off stage like moths around a lamp and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot it's as if you were to take every episode of the brady bunch and cram it into a 2 hour movie with bad songs br br the only thing that kept me watching as long as i did 1 hour was that i was looking at the camera techniques lighting and scenery which were all i admit excellent but is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hours not me maybe tomorrow i'll try watching the end aw who am i kidding i have more important things to do i'm sure you do too skip this,0
possible spoilers perhaps i must say that cinderella ii dreams come true is one of the worst movies ever made first of all the movie was made during the height of disney's sequel rampage it was created around the same time as the little mermaid ii the jungle book ii and peter pan ii all of which were disservices to their original film classics disney also made the hunchback of notre dame ii and atlantis ii but i'm going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place let me go ahead and say that i am an avid supporter of good disney films and i absolutely adore the original disney cinderella the sequel to cinderella however was a waste of time the character of cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that i grew up watching in the original cinderella was kind and loving the new cinderella had very out of character moments with current era phrasing like i'm going to do this banquet my way let me also tell you that new cinderella as i have affectionately named her says ewww that is the anti cinderella i try to find the best in people but in the sequel anastasia one of the stepsisters is good what the heck why they made it all out to be like lady tremaine and drizella are just horrible family members for poor little anastasia my question to the world did the people at disney watch the original cinderella when making this sequel well it surely doesn't seem so if i remember correctly anastasia was just as abusive to cinderella as drizella and lady tremaine i am all for redemption and forgiveness but there was no point of redemption for anastasia in this movie in the first one anastasia was evil in the second one she is good one just can't leave a story like this i hope disney realizes that this movie among other movies is shaming walt disney's name perhaps now that michael eisner is gone things will start shaping up around the house of mouse,0
for me this is one of the best movies i ever saw overcoming racism struggling through life and proving himself he isn't just an ordinary cookie carl brashear is an amazing character to play who puts cuba in his best light best performance in his life de niro who is a living legend gives that something to the movie hated his character in movie but he gives so much good acting to this film great performance and appearance of beautiful charlize was and as always is a big plus for every movie so if you haven't seen this movie i highly recommended for those who love bravery greatness who seek inspiration you must look this great drama my vote 9 10,1
have no illusions this is a morality story granger is the troubled ex buffalo hunter tempted back to the plains one more time by kill crazed taylor granger can see the end is near and feels deeply for the cost of the hunt on the herds the indians and the land itself taylor on the other hand admittedly equates killing buffalo or indians to 'being with a woman ' while granger's role of the tortured hunter is superb it's taylor who steals the show as the demented immoral 'everyman' out for the fast buck and the goodtimes there's not a lot of bang bang here but the story moves along quickly and we are treated to a fine character performance by nolan the theme of this story is just as poignant today as in the 1800s man's relationship to the land and what's on it and racism considering when this was made the censors must have been wringing their hankies during the scenes in the 'bawdy house' taylor's relationship with the squaw and much of the dialogue although downbeat this is truly a great western picture,1
i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm happy feeling i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time i thoroughly enjoyed this film the acting was superb although i would have to mention bill nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance and billy connolly as always totally gorgeous it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned such a refreshing experience to see a well written superbly acted and good looking movie,1
this amazing oscar winner 4 in total and john ford's first academy award winner is simply spellbinding with a pounding score by max steiner called an art film because ford had very little money to make this great story about guilt and retribution and greed and stupidity but what makes this movie such a classic is the direction and astounding photography and use of fog and lighting that was so different from the usual american film and more in the tradition of german expressionism and the oscar winning performance by victor mclaglen as the drunken gypo is simply unbelievable basically the movie takes place in ireland and gypo turns in a friend in the rebel movement to the english to collect 20 pounds to give to his girlfriend but having all that money he starts blowing it on an all night drunk and giving it away while the leaders of the movement are trying to track down the informer the whole movie is one night in a dark and foggy ireland and a cast of characters that are memorable but all along the whole world of gypo is closing in on him both psychologically if i had to pick maybe three directors to have all their movies on a deserted island forever and nobody elses john ford would certainly be one of them what a truly remarkable movie,1
i have a piece of advice for the people who made this movie too if you're gonna make a movie like this be sure you got the f x to back it up also don't get a bunch of z list actors to play in it another thing just about all of us have seen jurassic park so don't blatantly copy it all in all this movie sucked f x sucked acting sucked story unoriginal let's talk about the acting for just a second the carradine guy who's career peaked in 1984 when he did revenge of the nerds which was actually a great comedy he's not exactly z list he can act he just should have said no to this s t bag he should have did what mark hamill did after return of the jedi and go quietly into the night he made his mark as a nerd and that should have been that i understand he has bills to pay but that hardly excuses this s t bag have i called this movie that yet o k i just wanted to be sure if i sound a little hostile i apologize i just wasted 2hrs of my life i could have spent doing something productive like watching paint peel and i feel cheated i'll close on that note thank you for your time,0
i was around 7 when i saw this movie first it wasn't so special then but a few years later i saw it again and that time it made fun a lot br br i think the best parts of the film are yeti's body language and the 'special effects ' also br br if you wanna watch this movie don't wait for a hollywood made blockbuster even this film was made from approx 1000 dollars br br i've a copy of it movie and video version as well but i don't think it had been ever shown in cinemas br br watch it enjoy it yeti for ever,1
war inc corporations take over war in the future and use a lone assassin brand hauser john cusack to do their wet work against rival ceos a dark comedy satirizing the military and corporations alike it was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on i kept waiting for things to make sense there's no reason or method to the madness br br it's considered by cusack to be the spiritual successor to grosse point blank i e war is more or less a knock off we again see cusack as an assassin protecting spoiler the person he's supposed to kill as he grips with his conscience to be fair john cusack looks kind of credible taking out half a dozen guys with relative ease the brief fights look good the rest of the film does not it's all quirky often bordering on bizarre war inc's not funny enough to be a parody and too buoyant for anyone to even think about whatever the film's message might be which i suppose might be the heartless ways that corporations like war factions compete and scheme without a drop of consideration given to how they affect average citizens interesting but the satire just doesn't work because it's not funny and at its heart the film has no heart we're supposed to give a damn about how war affects cusack's shell of a character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by war br br john cusack gives a decent performance his character chugs shots of hot sauce and drives the tiniest private plane but quirks are meant to replace character traits marisa tomei is slumming as the romantic sidekick journalist there really isn't a lot of chemistry between them hilary duff tries a russian accent and doesn't make a fool of herself joan cusack just screams and whines and wigs out blech ben kingsley might have to return the oscar if he doesn't start doling out a decent performance now and again pathetic br br it's not a terrible movie but in the end you gotta ask war what is it good for absolutely nothing c,0
this film was made and cast from my home town i remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the fact molly ringwald was in town br br storyline br br essentially 20 years after a film was laid to rest without being finished a group of film students set out to complete it with dire consequences it would seem someone does not want the film completed br br the storyline is flimsy one has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek but it had no real oomph the characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just don't care about it seems irrelevant it is weird hearing kylie's accent as australian again and nice to see a kid i went to school with in a starring role but that doesn't redeem the film at all goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in molly ringwald perhaps due to the nature of the film it sort of pays homage to 80s films bad horror films but really an aussie actor would have done just fine br br as far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed constipated some of these kids especially the two main chics they played director and producer looked like they were trying to act that is never a good look also the shots had a rough feel about them over lit perhaps just not as smooth as one is used to br br the killer lord could it be less frightening there are some shock factors though and a couple of gross scenes i did like the film but it was not great it went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better they had a lot of characters get killed but no real build up to them getting slayed maybe if they had killed less people and actually concentrated on a scary atmosphere it would have been better br br now i know it is a comedy and elements were funny or so unbelieveable they were funny but i am not convinced br br lm,0
this first part of the brd trilogy has more passion and plot density than lola but less of the magic of veronica voss the political musings have point to them we see the shortages after the war how the blackmarketers were able to control so much of the day to day life delicious moment when fassbinder playing a grifter tries to sell a complete set of kleist to schygulla who remarks that burning books don't provide much warmth she really wants firewood br br there's some clumsiness in the first hour the scene in maria's room with the black soldier interrupted by hermann's appearance should go quicker the train scene when maria meets karl oswald falls flat when she insults the gi i cringed it was so bad but as the story develops and the years go by i was drawn more and more into this glossy cold world,1
this is an extremely dense somber and complicated film that unravels quite slowly revealing excruciating detail like the attention paid in a novel and watching this film is like watching a novel unfold while i didn't care for the narrator as i felt he was out of balance with the rest of the performances this film features some of the best ensemble acting i have ever seen and the lead summer phoenix is fabulous her innocence and naivete some might find implausible sort of a cross between cinderella and alice in wonderland i can buy that critique but she's still fabulous partially because she's unlike anything i've ever seen before br br this film is unbelievably beautiful filmed by eric gautier and part of what is so unique about this film is how it doesn't ever show what you'd expect it's always surprising and despite it's length the film never reveals more than it needs to at 163 minutes it's extremely concise to a fault i'd say which is one of the wonders of this film it's filled with brief moments which are simply stunning some of the best you're likely to see all year and all these moments add up in the end to an extraordinary film experience the family moments are unique ian holm is brilliant and what this film has to say about the theater hasn't been seen in films since cassavetes' opening night or perhaps chaplin's limelight but believe it or not this film is much less conventional i never knew where this film was going and now having seen it it still has multiple possibilities this is a powerful incredibly provocative film,1
i had somewhat high hopes for this since i like tim roth i was not pleased with this film i liked the ang lee the hulk a few years back so i figured this would have more of a bang to it first i was very disappointed with john hurt's performance here he looks as if his eyebrows were re shaped for this his performance was not convincing he was not as good as one would expect tim roth is cool as always here the gama thing didn't really stick to the original story line i don't think i guess the best part of the film was the end it had some cool action the only problem with the original was that it was too long this one is not as long but it got a bit boring at times i remember some time ago when walmart had this movie really cheap for sale and i always wondered why now i know i was hoping to to get blown away but i was not,0
it seems as if in science fiction you have this periodic throwback to perform an odd phenomenon that appears in long serial novels it's where the first novel dune ender's game blows you away with an actionpacked revolutionary story the sequels however take that universe and lead you down the garden path to whatever new little social or political commentary the author wants to make the matrix is finally the film equivalent the matrix stands tall alone as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle seeing this cash cow just sitting there and wanting to explore other aspects of society the writers and directors then lead you through what has to be some of the most painful monologues and non action sequences in scifi while the visuals remain as stunning from the first movies the new explorations of the characters falls terrible flat in the sequel watch for eye candy not for deep thought br br 4 out of 10 as registered by this fine website,0
everything about this film is hog wash pitiful acting awful dialog ugly native girls this movie sinks into oblivion the director must have been a weekend bender robert c is totally lost and has not got a clue on what is going on the college kids are worst no acting talent at all very stupid reasoning and just down right dumbbells special effects are for the birds the so called security force around this park belongs in toy land with stupid looking guns walkie talkies that are useless and a computer system that ranks with a roll of toilet paper if the park is under construction and nothing works why bother inviting potential clients until everything is complete the writers should be the first victims of the mess along with the producers and the crew the whole film belongs in a septic tank shot to another planet for viewing what a gem convicts should have to watch this so they can commit suicide,0
i was about 12 years old when i saw this classic casper the friendly ghost cartoon figured it was an early one since casper didn't look right the same way porky pig doesn't look right in the old 1930's cartoons but i digress br br anyway this episode in the friendly phantom's afterlife concerns him befriending a young fox todd whom he names ferdie i remember being happy to see casper have a friend as those who have watched the cartoons are wont to know that most people run away from him screaming a ghost br br casper and ferdie have some fun together until someone else shows up i hate to leave you with a semi spoiler but the cartoon is only seven minutes long so you can't really be too ambiguous besides anyone who reads the imdb synopsis of the cartoon can deduce what happens next br br the finale is a bit heartbreaking in fact it's probably the saddest i've ever felt watching a cartoon but that only means that it moved me which probably explains why i decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not very many others or heck the fact that i actually remember this cartoon at all is due to its emotional effect on me i haven't seen it since but the cartoon does end on an upbeat note and i was pleased to see casper and ferdie happy again br br i'd give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars second only to the warner bros cartoon peace on earth this is the most i've ever been moved by an animated short,1
a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie it's based on a novel of the same title which was equally good though different from the film really made you think about how you'd respond if you were in the shoes of the characters recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent spouse or family member in other words everyone br br though the production isn't quite hollywood quality no big special effects still the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill br br you don't want to miss this,1
wonderful family drama comedy starring macclaine and garr that entertains and warms the heart every time i see it strongly recommended for all ages from 9 year olds to grannies lovely period piece capturing 1962 the story encompasses the struggling garr her two children and aunt zena macclaine trying to make ends meet without a man as head of the household the family heads west to take the inheritance of a long forgotten relative that has left garr a run down ramshackle road side cafe right out of the late 1940's the tenacious garr as the sweet but determined mom gets the whole family into the restoration and opening of the cafe but wait aunt zena is an old circus performer with card tricks magic powders and a jesters sense of humor she loves to get the kids and her into silly and sometimes dangerous games what happens next is a delightful combination of miracle at lords thrown together with the cuban missile crises with authentic tv news from the real event and a ghost prank that gets totally out of hand this film entertains philosophizes questions religiosity and gives an unnerving glimpse of the frightening scare of october 1962's cuban missile crises in the end one is left with the wonder of faith family and rediscovered love oh and the music from the era of the early 60's is just great br br recommend strongly as a feel good film 10 out 10,1
don't get fooled with all the big names like burt reynolds james woods and anne archer they are just glorified extra's their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so whatever their motives for being in this movie if you have an actor like james woods you better make good use of him to me this is a sign of bad direction through and through the plot itself wasn't that bad and the acting from most of the actors was above average cuba gooding jr however was terrible he was so unbelievable that i almost laughed at his dramatic scenes and since this was meant as a serious movie that can't be a good thing the action scenes were not bad but they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting again better direction was needed also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this it took the main character almost half an hour to get in action for an action thriller of only 90 minutes that is far too slow the only redeeming factor is angie harmon she does her best to make it all work too bad the director left her hanging yes this movie could have been much better with a great director andy cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off and for an action stunt coordinator of his caliber you'd expect at least more exciting action scenes don't waste your time with this one avoid,0
i completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie for instance the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could hollywood just throw in a token gay character in the movie and besides there was two gay characters and i thought they reflected each other great one was normal and the other was more feminine but it wasn't over the top and diane keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to actual watch the entire film they would have seen that her character developed through out the film by interacting with the other characters for instance when she and adam went to look at the car that sara crashed in the junkyard you could see the maternal side of her come out and later in the film you saw that she too was invincible but i guess if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad but if you're more open minded and i don't know actually have some inkling of what is good then you'll enjoy this film,1
as if most people didn't already have a jittery outlook on the field of dentistry this little movie will sure make you paranoid patients squirm a successful dental hygienist witnesses his wife going down on the pool man on their anniversary of all days and snaps big time into a furious breakdown after shooting an attack dog's head off he strolls into work and ends up taking his marital aggression out on the patients as he plans what to do about his slut of a wife there are plenty of up close shots of mouth jabbing tongue cutting and beauty queen fondling as well as a marvelously deranged performance by corbin bernsen the scene in which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely hard to watch a dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail the dentist is incredibly entertaining fast paced and laughably gory at times check it out,1
the brothers quay are directors judging by conventional thought should have stuck to making short films i myself actually really liked their first feature institute benjamenta but judging by their sophomore effort the piano tuner of earthquakes i'm willing to agree they don't come close to equaling their past genius at feature length piano tuner is without a doubt a gorgeous film to look at and often to listen to unfortunately it's borderline painful to sit through with its convoluted narrative and glacial pace reading the plot synopsis it sounds like a pretty good story but the brothers fail miserably to bring it to life one thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future dialogue my god it's awful here a huge bust,0
take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 singles this was the premise of the show simple yet outrageous funny leave it to fox to throw morality out the window let the debauchery flow it was like a real life version of melrose place the good thing about the show is that it wasn't about people conniving manipulating each other for a cash prize it was about lust temptation pure and simple the ultimate test for a relationship br br people either loved the show or hated it it was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident you know you shouldn't watch but you can't help but look drama aside there was a lot of eye candy,1
i was p ed when i couldn't see this one when it was screening at the philly film fest last year so when i saw that it was going to be on cable tonight i put it on remind as soon as i could so was it worth the wait well let's backtrack a tad as i have yet to give you the plot sean crawley is a young man who doesn't know what his path in life is enter duke george wendt who introduces him to his boss ray danny baldwin one night ray totally hammered asks sean to off the guy that they had sean following around and it goes on from there which leads me back to the question posed was it worth the wait yes and no the buildup was pretty good and george wendt stole the movie for me he just took the ball and ran with it but it's nowhere near as violent as i was led to believe and somewhere along the movies running time the ball is not only dropped but fumbled and taken in the other direction i know where this point happened exactly but can't say without spoiling the film but needless to say it happened the ending doesn't save the film either poor stuart gordon nothing can be good like re animator or castle freak br br my grade c br br where i saw it showtime extreme br br eye candy kari wuhrer shows her ta tas in one fantasy and then in the next more ta tas and it pans down and oh my god my eyes my eyes,0
in case half of this film's footage looks strangely familiar it means you watch way too much of this gory italian cult crap for you see the notorious demigod lucio fulci did not only produce this movie he also took the liberty of re using the most sadistic killing sequences in his own and more easily traceable cat in the brain the opening scene already in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe features in fulci's later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments andrea bianchi's masssacre fails miserably as a giallo since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful but it's still good entertainment if you're into cheap 'n shlocky horror trash the incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters who're all potential maniacs but none of the red herrings biachi comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately whatever remains to enjoy are the truly misogynous make up effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast whenever there isn't any bloodshed on screen like between the first and second murder massacre is a slow and almost intolerable with its inane dialogs and thoroughly unexciting photography thankfully in the second half there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes the music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative my advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned cat in the brain that one features all the great moments of massacre and then some,0
i thought this move was very good there were a few things that were less than perfect but overall i was quite surprised the courtroom scene in the end seemed a little unrealistic but was real enough to be entertaining i found that the movie communicated the hardships of going though military training and the sacrifices that go along with it being a military pilot i could relate to many of these parts,1
a slight charming little movie to be sure but a superbly crafted one gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue this came out around the time of sense and sensibility and i'm sure i don't know why that one garnered all the oscar attention emma is jane austen's most accessible and least stuffy story told well,1
i saw this movie at the 2006 palm springs international film festival and it is a movie and not a film since it apparently was shot by hbo to be shown on their cable network sometime this year this movie presents page as a bondage and discipline fetish pinup and b d stag film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress page was a little more than that and the film touches on some of her other roles in modeling but not enough to balance out the career of the 50's pinup icon this film is supposedly based on the book the real bettie page by richard foster it's shot in black and white for that 1950's nostalgia feel i have the book called bettie page the life of a pinup legend that has a lot of great photos chronicling the career of page and i must say that this movie reproduces on film with gretchen mol as page many of those famous photo's very accurately mol herself with the bettie page black wig and brown contact lenses is bettie page not only does she have the bettie page look but she has the smile and characteristics of her personality that came through the camera down perfect and her body is as close to a replica of page's as possible terrific casting the story is kind of thin and tabloidesque and certainly could have been a lot better but this is a pretty good tv movie i would rate it a 7 0 of a scale of 10 and recommend it's viewing when it comes on tv,1
children love dinosaurs it's somewhat part of their culture but they've got the land before time the original at least that movie had heart this this movie is just plain pathetic just because kids love dinosaurs doesn't mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the children this movie has no plot the whole premise is stupid and it's more by the numbers stuff not as soul sucking as theodore rex but it's lightyears away from being a land before time,0
this is not so bad that it is good it is purely good for those who don't understand why you have the intellect of a four year old in response to a certain comment anyways killer tomatoes eat france is a parody of itself a parody of you and a parody of me it is the single most genius text in cinematic history i have it and the three prequels sitting on my dvd rack next to herzog and kurosawa it embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard i write scripts and this movie single handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me the likes of which we have never seen it can only be taken in portions its sort of exploitive by now i'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum my comment ended a while ago hopefully it works when i submit it now,1
i never seem to write a review on imdb unless i am extremely surprised at how good or how bad a movie is this film falls into the first category every year i try to see all the nominees for best foreign film at the oscars even those that i know i won't like as it is in heaven seems to fit the bill the plot sounds sugary and sentimental and slow for my tastes which run more towards original dark and or daring foreign cinema michael haneke francois ozon a lot of modern japanese korean cinema as it is in heaven does not sound particularly interesting it didn't get released in the usa so i sat down to watch a vcd i found in singapore preparing to cross it off the list after a dull beginning as it is in heaven becomes that rare film where you really become inspired by what is happening on screen weak points the characters in the film are pure stock characters the wounded dreamer the town bully the battered wife the loose woman yearning for love the repressed minister thankfully they're largely a likable bunch as well as being well written and well acted ingela olsson as the minister's wife inger would have been nominated for an oscar had her performance been in english strong points the music is beautiful and the main song sung by gabriella is truly dramatic and memorable and keep an eye out for the feisty 87 year old actress playing olga who is keeping up with the dancing steps as well as the younger ladies i won't discuss the ending but i will say that it makes sense they're are a lot of emotional things happening in the last hour of the film and you're not quite sure why they're happening although nothing is explained in words it all makes sense as the movies comes to a fitting crescendo out of probably the strongest swedish movie i've ever seen,1
sly stallone is hardly the finest actor in the world but compared to his brother frank well roll out those awards now mullet haired muppet frank seems to think that every part he plays calls for him doing the role as an american italian wise guy refugee from the 'godfather ' please somebody make him an acting offer 'he can refuse ' this film just stinks the place out even by the terrible overacting in this frank still steals the acting dishonours all the people compensate for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing their arms about gesticulating wildly in a style that went out of fashion back with silent films br br the plot what there is makes no sense as a meteor lands and turns all the women into sex crazed nymphets but as this is 15 certificate film that just means they strip to their underwear and make moaning sounds like dogs on heat what happens in the end i'm not quite sure as i was losing the will to live long before the film finished br br avoid this like the plague and watch 'deep impact' for a reasonable film about a meteor about to hit the earth br br n b point of order when one of the female leads strips down to her underwear she has her knickers panties under her suspenders garter belt it's knickers over the suspenders to allow women to go to the toilet with less fuss a trivial point perhaps but shows how dumb this film is when they can't even get this right,0
this movie is intelligent that is more than most other movies it transcends the least common denominator stupid people will probably not appreciate it the story also relies heavily on dialogue it has some parallels to lost in translation although before sunrise is much brighter somehow less abstract and simply a lot better br br the script the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic the actors play absolutely brilliantly rarely have i seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together br br the dialogue moves into very personal issues with the risk of becoming a little over the top it does however stay on the right side almost all the time although i found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors sometimes it yields great results and overall this movie is simply stupendous only very very rarely is love in films depicted in a way that i find trustworthy and realistic every time that is achieved the result is fantastic i think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect she still looks stunning in this film 12 years after br br this is simply a gem of a movie that you can't miss one of the best movies i have seen from the 1990s,1
the only reason i don't give this movie fewer than 3 stars is because it isn't quite on par with a movie like manos the hands of fate this movie's greatest crime is the fact that it is head meltingly boring terribly unforgivably british the premise of this movie sounds potentially promising the whole teleporting concept but the direction they went with it was completely uninteresting it was more a movie about research funding and bowties than projecting lasers the actors were wooden unemotional and aloof as was the love affair between the two scientists which was anything but intriguing i never was able to tell what the attraction was between them as the chemistry was non existent nor did i really understand why the melty faced main guy decided to slaughter everyone he met at least now i know that i should always give someone a fair hearing before i cut off their research grants else they go rampaging about killing wantonly with goofy hand gestures,0
let's face it some lame kid who dies and has his soul transfered into a scarecrow das no gonna happen neva omfg this stupid loser kid who can't stand up for himself gets his ass handed to him by some drunk bastard screwing his mom right as he dies he looks up at the scarecrow and he let's his spirit go into the scarecrow the drunk guy covered up his death by making it seem suicidal and thought he had gotten away with it we later see he is tossed out of the trailer and later earns another encounter with the scarecrow they had a brief encounter which includes the drunk calling him a loser and the scarecrow rebounding with takes one to know one loser the scarecrow flips off the building calls him daddy o and then beheads the poor man we can see how this awesome movie unfolds from that he goes on to kill many people afterward he mainly kills the people who gave him a hard time in rl and goes off to kill some random ass people just for some laughs no laughing here he adds a punchline to every kill too every time he killed someone he would do some karate flips and finish it all off with one of his signature punchlines in the case of someone who was hard of hearing he would say here have an ear of corn then shove it up their ass or we can actually take an example from the movie he just got done killing a cop and was on his way to killing the only person who ever stood up for him her father the sheriff yelled to the madman to stop and he said hey stay awhile and threw a dagger threw his chest and stuck him onto some tree in the end of the movie he killed two guys and threw in the punchline gotta split and killed two guys by shoving a scythe into their heads wowzors this movie made me want to cream my pants so bad maybe next time this guy makes a movie it won't be gay,0
if you've seen this movie you've been to puerto rico i've lived in puerto rico all my life and have to shamefully admit that we pr are living a real chaos right now drugs being the main reason for the shootings and killings we have almost every day these people will shoot anyone anytime and anywhere and many innocent lives have been lost because of this we don't feel safe anymore and in addition to this our so called justice is no longer moved by truth and rightness but by money influence and power ladrones y mentirosos is based on real deplorable facts and truly portrays puerto rico's three main problems the drug related killings money and power manipulating our courtrooms and innocent people and children being corrupted and even dying because of this ricardo and his wife poli with their true to life plot and their award winning direction were brave enough to present all this as bad as it is puerto rico is a beautiful and friendly country living a nightmare that doesn't seem to end they recently won the copper wing award for best director in the world cinema competition at the 2006 phoenix film festival,1
i think if you are into the sixties kind of thing as i am you are obligated to waste about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely watchable trainwreck the saving graces of this oddity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixties values along with a number of relatively well known actors caught in early and embarrassing footage it's as if the producers of laugh in sat down and decided to write a full length film covering all the high points and more of the issues between the flower children and the establishment then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a 10 000 budget to complete it hardly a classic but in its own way it does capture how truly strange that time was the silliness the over idealism and the uptightness of the establishment clearly not for everyone,0
another powerful chick flick this time it revolves around diana gusman who is always getting into fights at school instead of getting expelled she takes her anger elsewhere to the boxing ring she trains to be a boxer and there she meets featherweight adrian and begins to fall in love with him this movie has a powerful message of taking your dreams and going with them even if someone doesn't believe in you in this case her dad doesn't believe in her that alone makes the movie worth the price enjoy,1
i gave this movie a rating of 1 awful the only reason that it should even get a 1 instead of a big 0 is ben kingsley who always shines not matter what terrible material is thrown his way br br mira sorvino is so out of her element here that as a viewer one simply can't get over the fact that she is even in such a piece br br stupid stupid story and horrible production do not waste your video rental,0
i own 2 home entertainment stores and i've seen a lot of bad movies in my time but this one was so bad it compelled me to register here and comment on it how bad was it let's just say that sofia coppola deserved an oscar for her performance in godfather iii when compared to giada colagrande's in this movie br br it was robotic and uninspired her lover has just died one month prior to her arrival at the 'rubber house' he had given her once there she discovers he has cheated on her throughout her relationship but none of it seems to register with her within a day she starts a relationship with leslie dafoe the caretaker of the house even though she is married to dafoe off screen her scenes with him were cold and unemotional br br if there was a plot i missed it not even willem dafoe could save this movie from the amateur cinematic train wreck that it is,0
probably new zealands worst movie ever made br br the jokes they are not funny used from other movies just plain corny the acting is bad even though there is a great cast br br the story is uninteresting boring has more cheese then pizza huts cheese lovers pizza kind of like the acting has been do 1 000 times before br br i watched this when it came on tv but was so boring could only stand 30 minutes of it br br this movie sucks br br do not watch it br br watch paint dry instead,0
back in 1985 i caught this thing i can't even call it a movie on cable i was in college and i was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control i figured out early on that this was hopeless stupid script a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women bad acting with one exception and pathetic jokes the plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while but even he was bored after 30 minutes in remember this was a high school boy this was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the internet and such we kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened the funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap one poster had a fictional review that said this is the best movie i've seen this afternoon only grant cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business no budget and boring t a skip it,0
first of all we know that bruce willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you'll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same his character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far and counting the story begins in the not so far future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth the story seems to go towards sf but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story about that movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you'll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good but that doesn't mean that the ending wont pull your nerves cause its pretty good as far as the direction goes it is prefect movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better so if you are getting ready to see a sci fi movie or some action you'll miss it b there should be more movies like this,1
this movie was pretty good the acting was great and there were some really great actors in it like buchholz and roger moore this film is full of surprises confusing at times yes but the twists and turns of the plot always keeps you in suspense the only thing that this movie had too much of was exploding cars,1
i love seth green his appearances on that 70s' show is always worth watching but last night i felt the show needed to overhauled four single young guys inherit a new york city apartment that most of us would die for the grandmother must have been an heiress to have such space in the first place so i felt the need for realism should have been brought out anyway the plot about four best friends getting this apartment was not believable i would have been thrilled if they had to move in with one of their parents which would have provided great humor and dysfunctional about the show's set up there did not seem to be much humor in it i am only watching it because it falls before my name is earl on a winning thursday night i think they should go back scrap this series and start over we need more family involved series how about seth and his friends move in with his wacky parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place down they could have dabney coleman play the father and christine estabrook play the mother and dysfunctional siblings the list of possibilities with somebody like seth green are endless and the network is blowing it,0
i downloaded this movie yesterday through an internet site the quality was kinda good i was watching the movie with high expectations though i knew it was a flop especially as the film has superstar amitabh bachchan playing the role of a villain i though at least actors like him would have done some worth to their roles but unfortunately mr bachchan failed to impress as villain this proved that nobody can compete amjad khan's magic rgv's trial to re kindle the past backfired royally sholay the old one is a milestone in indian cinema with an all star cast cult dialogue stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack which is still a hit with present generations too a good actor like ajay devgan's talents are wasted and his performance was average prashant raj a newcomer doesn't know what acting is nisha kothari proved she is one of the worst actresses we have i don't know how she is still in rgv's crew urmila abhishek seen in a song with no excitement and passion mohanlal tried his best and susmitha sen's work was good i somehow liked her work in this movie it was a total carnage of the original sholay,0
the first film was a nice one but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which i found more poignant and endearing this sequel is inferior but not bad at all sure the slapstick is too much the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired but the dogs are very cute here and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw the film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes especially cruella's and the music is pleasant the acting is mostly very good ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as cruella's accomplice but the best asset as it was with the first film is the amazing glenn close in a deliciously over the top performance as cruella even more evil than she was previously overall nice 7 10 bethany cox,1
people call this a comedy but when i just watched it i laughed br br only once i guess the problem is that i first saw it when i was 14 br br and i wasn't old enough to understand that it wasn't meant to be br br taken seriously there were quite a few scenes that were meant br br to be funny but i cared too much about the characters to laugh at br br them br br i suggest that you watch this film next time you're falling in love br br and try to take it seriously i think you'll find that despite a few silly br br flaws it's one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen,1
wow this is very unusual in one regard usually the first movie in a long string of sequels is the best of the bunch people are surprised when a sequel is actually better with tarzan i thought this movie was the worst of the bunch or at least the first six which comprise my tarzan collection dvd package i will gladly watch the sequels multiple times but i am through sitting through this turkey thanks to several characters br br well let's start with the good news first br br the good plenty of action with a lot of wild animals on display even if they are just stock footage you see lion attacks crocodiles hippos panthers you name it and you see several of the different tribes of all kinds including pygmies called dwarfs in the movie since this movie was made almost 75 years ago i can't knock any of the realism because they didn't have it in the movies that long ago they do the best they can so you put up with actors talking in front of fake backgrounds however weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape he and o'sullivan make a well built handsome couple if there ever was one in those golden years of cinema br br the film has historical value with so many sequels in that it shows how tarzan acquired jane and his beginnings of learning the english language br br the bad from the moment jane parker is taken by tarzan almost every scene with her is maureen o'sullivan in hysterics shrieking and screaming scene after scene it's enough to give you a headache and it ruins the film thankfully she calmed down in the sequels but not in this movie the movie also does no favors for the great white hunter image as c aubrey smith playing jane's father and neil hamilton as harry holt the safari guide shoot at every animal within sight whether the beasts is threatening or not these people are kill happy particularly smith on another note it's too bad there isn't anything in here explaining how tarzan got to be in the jungle in the first place there is no history of him in here or footage of his growing up he's just there when jane and the group get to a certain point in africa,0
by the time this film was released i had seen chorus line on stage 4 times and had been anticipating most eagerly the long rumored production of a film of the story my wife and i were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released it was not just a disappointment it was a kick in the abdomen br br first the story was moved outside so to speak by including scenes not in the confines of the theater those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story br br second third together assign your own order one of the original songs with very dynamic dance number was removed a song which was not in the stage production was added say what i'm confused br br the only reason i gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers i've now seen chorus line on stage 6 times and wouldn't mind seeing it 6 more times before i die it is superbly written with wonderful music and heart wrenchingly true stories if you want to see a musical which includes a great cattle call audition i recommend all that jazz if you want to see the story of a chorus line see it on stage,0
a pleasant surprise i expected a further downgrade along the line the rock 9 con air 7 armaggeddon 4 especially for such an overhyped film perhaps that's the reason so few approved of this new type of bruckheimer fare clever dialogue instead of snappy one liners decent background motivation instead of shake n bake stereotypes and when the chase came you really thirsted for it fanboys expecting an armageddon rollercoaster stay away this is one for the more intelligent action fans it didn't even bother me jolie appeared so little,1
guys and dolls is a movie itching for a remake it was made forty eight years ago its two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds although a remake with big stars now would be box office success it would not be able to capture the magic that went into this version its boundless energy can't be recaptured nor can the pure joy you get when watching something like this a huge widescreen big entertainment movie br br marlon brando who last clocked in at 409 lbs last time i heard plays sky masterson one of the biggest gamblers in new york frank sinatra is nathan detroit whose as often as he can find a speakeasy for it crap game is city wide famous however when the one place he has left to hold it is charging 1 000 detroit needs the money fast he bets masterson 1 000 that he can't take missionary sarah brown jean simmons to havana with him the next day br br guys and dolls is basically nothing more than unsavory types singing and dancing which usually as it does here add up to fun it's obvious to see how this was a broadway musical there weren't that many sets and the scenes were long if i was to complain about one thing it's how uneven the songs were at times there were two songs in a scene other times thirty minutes went by without one guys and dolls is never boring just a great time br br my rating 8 10 br br not rated,1
well this was one of those films i caught on the off chance and it was good enough for me to record when it showed up next time if like myself you enjoy many 80's horror flicks that branched out a little from the norm i e not just another glut of generic sequels then i think you may enjoy this when the bad guy eventually turns up in person he was definitely not what i expected to see all in all i wouldn't go out of your way for this one but if you like the genre then watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill i guess i'd give it 6 5 out of 10,1
this mini series also based on a book by alex haley as was queen' tried to use similar formulas that is constructing a long history following the lives of a family over many years whereas in queen' the result was masterful here in mama flora the inspiration was lacking firstly perhaps in the book itself and most certainly in this tv production too much is put in with too much haste over the years such that the unfolding saga is shallow superficial not nearly so authentic as in queen' full marks for the scenification in the earlier parts of the film which was prepared with great care but as the film progressed it seemed to degenerate into a kind of dallasian forsythian unpalatable mix in the last third of its three hours or so duration i had hoped for more but evidently haley was less inspired with this tale than his near biographical queen' and peter werner iii is no match for john erman only recommendable for those who have an appetite for these lengthy tales of generations growing up,0
sunday would not be sunday without an action movie and when you want intense combat you turn to tom berenger platoon br br here he plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebels and drug lords life's a bitch so he gets a green office type billy zane to help on the mission br br the film is in the hands of luis llosa who stunk up anaconda he doesn't do much better here but berenger makes the movie worthwhile br br sure it may be a little long who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle but is is good tense action when the time is right,1
the plot is so manipulative counting completely on the most uncredible and unthinkable decisions of the adults in each and every parenting decision the children are super as far as charm and delivery of the lines but as i say the whole plot depends on each and every adult being complete idiots and therefore in that case making more sense out of their actions and at the same time being the only way to explain the boys actions of total mistrust why would sweey charming little boys take a baby from the shore how did the baby get to the shore and at the same time account for it being the last place to be searched why would the 2 boys never be informed an instead at the same time a baby is missing nobody gives a fig about them running around with food and diapers with all that commotion going on and literally every other place it searched there is just no possible justification to ask the audience to believe this asking to believe it would then do to trial even the informal setting is too insulting to bare,0
the japenese sense of pacing editing and musical score must be different than american tastes but surely this movie could have been so much more with a little more post production work br br someone in hollywood needs to re make this movie and i think it would be a big hit the story is interesting and creepy there's something about the edges of the city gritty policemen earthquakes sanitariums and mysterious saltwater killings that is enough to be captivating however this story has to make just a little bit of sense and maybe be about 40 minutes shorter br br i do have to say that the sixth sense effect was in full force in this movie and that was evident from the very beginning br br as it stands only the die hard japanese film lovers should bother seeing this oh so boring movie,0
this was one of the dvd's i recently bought in a set of six called frenchfilm to brush up our french before our planned holiday in beautiful provence this year so far as well as improving our french we have considerably enhanced our appreciation of french cinema br br what a breath of fresh air to the stale predictable unimaginative crash bang wallop drivel being churned out by hollywood what a good example for screenplay writers actors directors and cinematographers to follow it was so stimulating also to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures br br the other thing i liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly naïve benefactor with the type of contempt that an ex con would display will our sexually frustrated poor little half deaf heroine prove herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has bestowed upon her the viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each other br br once you have seen this film like me you may want to see it again i still have to work out the director's psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look the plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our misused and overworked heroine in the office you must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place but if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of french cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied four stars out of five for me,1
saw this movie in my english class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was don't get me wrong george c scott was terrific as scrooge but the rest of the cast fails so very badly sometimes i couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line merry christmas to everyone other times i almost fell asleep br br the movie is based on a charles dickens short story about a rich guy who don't think christmas is nothing but humbug after 30 minutes the rich guy is visited by three ghosts who persuade him to celebrate christmas after all br br i can not understand how this movie with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes can be so well rated instead of this piece of garbage i recommend to you the bill murray comedy scrooged that at least was funny,0
although stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances it is certainly not when i saw the movie i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies and i was right br br stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film it has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the very end of the movie the storyline is well written and it keeps you on the edge of your seat like every tale it has some short of morality therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers won't take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey we also know that the true love is yvaine and not victoria the material girl who is shallow and manipulative br br i have to give extra credits to claire danes she literally shines in this movie her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character moreover she and cox do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable the rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make stardust an interesting and ''high classed'' movie br br overall the movie is fantastic the locations magical and the plot interesting i was very disappointed that the film didn't get nominated for more awards i have to give at least 9 10 stars for this,1
first of all i liked very much the central idea of locating the '' intruders'' others in the fragile self on various levels mainly subconscious but sometimes more allegorical in fact the intruders are omnipresent throughout the film in the swiss french border where the pretagonist leads secluded life in the his recurring daydream and nightmare inside his ailing body after heart transplantation in the last half of the film he becomes intruder himself returning in ancient french colony in the hope of atoning for the past br br the overall tone is bitter rather than pathetic full of regrets and guilts sense of failure being more or less dominant this is a quite grim picture of an old age ostensibly self dependent but hopelessly void and lonely inside the directer composes the images more to convey passing sensations of anxiety and desire than any explicit meanings some of them are mesmerizing not devoid of humor though kind of absurdist play only somnambulist can visualize,1
an idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been unfaithful so no new story lines here however the authors managed to create a stupid disgusting film if you enjoy watching kids vomiting or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wife's teeth out in a bloody horror type go see or rent the film if not move on to something else my fair lady anyone,0
miscasting happens susannah yorke is a luminous young jane eyre and her performance is impeccable however edward rochester is supposed to be 35 white haired george c scott looks and behaves like an arthritic 80 jane's deceased uncle is in better shape he creaks and snarls obnoxious and grim he looks like an ax murderer who has sent his ax out to be sharpened we're not surprised he keeps a wife caged in the attic the great love story looks like a sado masochistic nightmare there is enough darkness in the novel but bronte's rochester is relatively young athletic powerful and charming when he chooses to be he has a fine speaking and singing voice a good mind and a conscience that he unsuccessfully attempts to stifle,0
horrible i see many user comments on how great this show is it truly is a wanna be friends made in taiwan knockoff the jokes are lame as and the plot is ridiculous the actors are obviously struggling to be funny and are probably cringing when they hit those awful punchlines if you can call them that the bulk of the other users who have commented are obviously from another planet or at least another continent there are obviously reasons that tv companies cancel shows and none of then are when shows are doing well make sense anyway steer clear even if it is raining and there is absolutely nothing else on this planet to do go stand in the rain instead more fun,0
the first time i saw this film i was in shock for days afterwards its painstaking and absorbing treatment of the subject holds the attention helped by good acting and some really intriguing music the ending quite simply had me gasping first rate,1
this film is probably pro muslimization br br why do i write that the main character has a muslim father and a christian mother he lives his first 20 years in a christian village in the end of the film he seemingly is a muslim because of his head wear that he has kept his amulet and his general clothing he has a six year old child who wears the same head wear and therefore is probably a muslim although the mother is a christian the main character thus chooses to it seems to be a muslim and his child becomes a muslim no one of the other male main characters which are christians seems to breed a child there are more muslims in the world of this movie at the end of it it therefore seems,0
rarely do i see a film that i am totally engrossed with this was one of them it had good acting dialogue plot and the scenery was beautiful i laughed out loud many times especially the scene dealing with the kitchen raid the slapstick comedy performed by the lunkhead hired hand had me one the floor but i admit that i am a sucker for slapstick the story dealt with a group of people in their 30's coming back to a summer camp that they had attended 20 years previously it was a farewell week of camping as the place would be closed down permanently at the end of the season as adults the camp looked different and they felt differently about it and each other i recommend this funny moving movie to all br br,1
mysterious murders in a european village seem the result of the vampire bat horde plaguing the terrified community br br this surprisingly effective little thriller was created by majestic pictures one of hollywood's poverty row studios the sparse production values and rough editing actually add to its eerie atmosphere and lend it an almost expressionistic quality overall it leaves the viewer the feeling of being caught up in a bad dream which is appropriate for a thriller of this sort br br even though the eventual explanation for the hideous crimes is quite ludicrous and is not given proper plot development the film can boast of a good cast grave lionel atwill gives another one of his typically fine performances this time as a doctor doing scientific research in an old castle beautiful fay wray plays his assistant in a role which requires her to do little more than look lovely alarmed dour melvyn douglas appears as the perplexed police inspector who also happens to be conveniently miss wray's boyfriend br br maude eburne who could be extremely funny given the right situation steals most of her scenes as miss wray's hypochondriac aunt elderly lionel belmore plays the village's terrified burgermeister and little dwight frye who will always be remembered for his weird roles in the frankenstein and dracula films here is most effective as a bat loving lunatic,1
as far as spaghetti westerns go i'd put this man can't die on the dull side of the genre it's not that the movie is particularly bad but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other sws i've seen guy madison does his best in the lead role but lacks the on screen charisma necessary to pull it off with one notable exception the rest of the cast isn't particularly good the direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that i haven't seen before there's just not much to get very excited about br br the cast exception i mentioned is rosalba neri she's the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film unfortunately her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes note the imdb page for this man can't die is wrong rosalba neri does not play jenny benson instead she is the character melin i'm not sure how anyone could mistake rosalba neri for some guy named john bartha as listed in imdb's credits for the movie,0
surprisingly well done for an independent film an insomniac's nightmare paints a startling picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia wonderfully well written and directed it creates the atmosphere of a dream as the viewer is taken through one night in the life of an insomniac br br starring dominic monaghan as jack we get to see everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night drag on the narration is almost hypnotizing and from the opening lines it is impossible to turn away fascinating and slightly disturbing it shows how someone copes with a lack of sleep balancing on the brink between sanity and madness br br with twists and turns around every corner an insomniac's nightmare is provocative and engaging it comes very highly recommended,1
we stumbled upon the documentary grey gardens last sunday and got sucked in without warning everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the haunting images of edith and edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach eating ice cream and corn on the cob which was cooked on the bedside table and the cat urinating on edith's bed and her unbelievable words i thrive on it the smell we had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in spellbinding a must see,1
this entertainingly tacky'n'trashy distaff death wish copy stars the exceptionally gorgeous and well endowed brunette hottie supreme karin mani as billie clark a top notch martial arts fighter and one woman wrecking crew who opens up a gigantic ten gallon drum of ferocious chopsocky whup a on assorted no count scuzzy muggers rapists drug dealers and street gang members after some nasty low life criminals attack her beloved grand parents the stunningly voluptuous ms mani sinks her teeth into her feisty butt stomping tough chick part with winningly spunky aplomb beating jerky guys up with infectious glee and baring her smoking hot bod in a few utterly gratuitous but much appreciated nude scenes unfortunately mani possesses an extremely irritating chewing on marbles harsh and grating voice that's sheer murder on the ears my favorite moment concerning mani's dubious delivery of her dialogue occurs when she quips don't mess with girls in the park that's not nice after clobbering a few detestable hooligans the delectable karin's sole subsequent film role was in avenging angel in which she does a truly eye popping full frontal nude scene but doesn't have any lines the film's single most sensationally sleazy sequence transpires when mani gets briefly incarcerated on a contempt of court charge and shows her considerably substantial stuff in a group prison shower scene of course mani's lascivious lesbian cell mate tries to seduce her only to have her unwanted advances rebuffed with a severe beatdown strangely enough the lesbian forgives mani and becomes her best buddy while she's behind bars given an extra galvanizing shot in the vigorously rough'n'ready arm by edward victor's punchy direction a funky rockin' score endearingly crummy acting by a game if lame cast a constant snappy pace numerous pull out all the stops exciting fight scenes and howard anderson iii's gritty photography this immensely enjoyable down'n'dirty exploitation swill is essential viewing for hardcore fans of blithely low grade low budget grindhouse cinema junk,1
well there is a plenty of ways how to spoil a political thriller usually they are derivative or too ambitious often they feature a conspiracy that is totally paranoic and unbelievable but city hall does not do neither of the above mentioned the plot is cleverly crafted story is believable as far as characters go i would say this movie is a solid average no character seems out of place and al pacino is brilliant as always his portrayal of a charismatic nyc mayor is superb and proves again that al pacino belongs to the absolute top of american actors nowadays,1
the most difficult thing about this movie is to say anything positive about it the characters were stereotypical white trash the movie's plot was stunted from the beginning and the worst feature of this movie was that the nudity was so blatantly from body doubles it was funny regretfully that was the only funny thing in the movie ms jenkins would be better served if in the future she would refrain from using her life story to entertain people it was simply that bad the one positive aspect of this movie this has nothing to do with the lack of quality of the film is that my brother shelled out the money for this stinker,0
convoluted infuriating and implausible fay grim is hard to sit through but parker posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it she's at once touching funny cunning the supporting actors commit to it as well br br i wont even try to tell you the plot it involves characters from hartley's henry fool and attempts a tale of international espionage br br the film works well if you continue along with it understanding it is in a sense completely ridiculous it becomes more and more ridiculous as you plod along i resisted the temptation to turn off the dvd twice br br fay grim requires an adventurous film goer willing to tackle something that isn't cookie cutter in the end it offers something that defies description,1
i guess every time i see one of these old movies from the 80's it puts me back at a simpler time no matter how corny they may seem today this movie is a good one i remember seeing it as a small kid and thinking it was the greatest movie ever it has all the heroistic characters that a young cowboy wants to be now as an adult i can look back and laugh and still feel sad but this time i actually know what's going on i did find one thing weird how many people can move to houston and hook up with sissy get married move into a trailer have a falling out cheat have an uncle die then get back together all in the course of a month only in america,1
i bought this dvd set sight unseen and wish i hadn't the script needed some serious rewriting as it seems to be completely devoid of any feeling and pales in comparison to the book the lighting is horrid very unpolished but if it was just that i could overlook it the script doesn't focus enough on the characters there is hardly an introduction to various characters making it a tad difficult to distinguish who is who especially in the planes no idea who dies when br br i have long felt that the key to a good film is in getting the audience to care about the characters if you don't have that you don't have anything there was no focus on the characters at all you never got to know them who they were what they liked what made them do the things that they do the series is 5 hours long and split up into 6 parts i bet you are wondering what they did with all this time if they didn't detail the characters they put a lot of filler in it i will say at least an entire hour is spent watching them land and take off in their planes lol i mean do we really need to see that over and over again i would have given this a much higher rating had they just improved our knowledge of the characters,0
i would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season 10 br br the final episode of the 10th season unending where it would certainly appear that the asgard have been killed off in a very rushed unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion left me in disbelief br br from the extremely rushed end of the series it's obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg 1 franchise for the two upcoming direct to dvd moves br br unless the asgard return in a future sg 1 movie with a very good explanation of the apparent extinction i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean up of loose ends br br poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci fi series,1
this is so incredibly bad poor actors you can tell they're trying really hard to polish a turd but we all know you can't the writing is so obvious and facile it's sad watching them try to sell it the humor and pacing are so labored it's hard to believe any of these good actors signed on for this br br that said it's so awful that we're having a hard time looking away from the screen we just have to know where this trainwreck goes but that's only because we caught it on tv if we had actually paid for this we'd be disgusted br br so it gets 2 stars for being at least amusingly fascinatingly bad and the incidental music as opposed to the trying too hard indie soundtrack is laughably reminiscent of an episode of scooby doo but not as good,0
okay truthfully i saw the previews for this movie and thought to myself what are the producers thinking hutton jolie and duchovny how could the monotoned actor possibly compete with jolie's natural power on the screen but surprisingly the two had the kind of chemistry that showed intense caring without a kiss even david's humor matched up to jolie's spark and fire as for hutton he played the psycho very well contrasting with david's calm delivery of life threatening situations overall i was very impressed with the writing and character development i gave it 8 stars,1
i watched this film not really expecting much i got it in a pack of 5 films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect and you know what i was right they were all terrible this movie has a few and a few is stretching it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer i e damned annoying and well thats about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious i had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they don't half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot i thought he looked a bit like a meercat all this and i haven't even mentioned the killer i'm not even gonna go into it its just not worth explaining anyway as far as i'm concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london who was actually quite funny it wasn't because of their acting talent i've certainly seen a lot worse but i've also seen a lot better best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry,0
i think it is a nice movie i think it is a very romanian movie through scenery and atmoshpere i think it was not intended to be sensual sensuality is a result not a purpose i think it is very natural i think it is humane i think it was interesting i think the actors never made me think waw lame acting they are not sean connory co neither is the film a block buster they are like the movie normal ppl that can act i think the movie reached its intention i think it made me feel things or feel them again i think i'm not objective br br i really enjoyed it that i know,1
this movie should be required viewing for all librarians or would be librarians all of the best lines are directly related to librarianship the public library vs academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students it also breaks many librarian stereotypes librarians might even be capable of having fun even if they don't usually have sex in the romance languages section the best movie about librarians desk set with katherine hepburn and spencer tracy of course,1
maybe the greatest film ever about jazz br br it is jazz br br the opening shot continues to haunt my reverie br br lester of course is wonderful and out of this world br br jo jones is always a delight see the sound of jazz as well br br if you can find the music it's available on cd br br all lovers of jazz and film noir should study this tremendous jewel br br what shadows and light what music what a hat,1
shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect certainly much more true to the peter o'donnell books and comic strip than the previous two films you can read the strip currently in the reprints from titan books or in comics revue monthly it is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time the movie isn't great but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got and it holds your interest on the dvd extras the interview with quentin tarentino who is obviously stoned is a gas some people have faulted tarentino for associating his name with the film but without him it would never have been made he is a modesty blaise fan and picked a good writer and director all things considered worth 8 stars,1

the first time i saw this i didn't laugh too much at the time i was only about fifteen years old and thought that maybe some of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at the time i had the same reaction when i viewed it a second time a few months ago and this time it was because felix's aborted suicide attempt at the beginning of the movie kind of darkened the movie a bit this scene made some of the things oscar said and did to felix later in the movie seem needlessly cruel and their personality clashes weren't as amusing as they could have been had i not already known the story i would have been worried that some of oscar's antics to felix might push him over the edge as it was it didn't make me laugh or smile like the television show with jack klugman and tony randall did still all in all a pretty good movie and it spawned one of the greatest sitcoms on television 7 out of 10,1

the best thing about camp films in general is that you know what to expect it's like watching a professional wrestling match or a day time soap opera or a jerry springer show you immediately can follow the skimpy plot identify the cardboard characters and watch in satisfaction while all the cliches are being fulfilled however at times the director does something real unexpected it may be something extraordinarily stupid or something weird or something insightful the director makinen is up there with the best camp directors and this is his best movie br br in yon saalistajat everything seems to come together there's nothing good about it but still manages to be a coherent whole not once does the movie slow down the action flows on and punches keep on coming br br the weirdest thing is that there's no sense of time some characters seem to take months doing something while other characters have only spent one hour at a bar this is partially due to finnish summer where the sun never sets so you don't experience the day turning into a night at all br br finally there is a plot there somewhere you may have to watch the movie three times before you realize it though,0
the haunting a remake of course the original was a creepy psychological thriller and one that has improved with time compared to this 1999 remake it's a classic there is no character development here only caricatures the slut the authoritative brain the i'm gonna get us outta here fellow the oh so sensitive bookworm but seeing as how the were banking on the special effects being the star i guess characters that you can empathize with are a secondary concern unfortunately the effects are laughable mewing cherubs stretchy doors irritating dead children that can't speak plainly and an idiotically sappy ending that does it's darnedest to give you a new age enema of butterflies and rainbows ill take my skittles orally thank you bruce dern i've liked you since the cowboys stop it,0
man some of you people have got to chill this movie was artistic genius instead of searching for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality why can't you understand that it is a work of fiction a story entertainment for god's sake no pun intended it seems to me that too many of the people on here are trying to be movie critics and they're not doing to well i'm so impressed by the movie and bill paxton's job at directing that i'm going to contact him personally to tell him ya know if you weren't trying to analyze the heck out of the possibility of the story line you might just enjoy the film me and all of my friends did,1
i was very pleased to go and see a milanese film shot in milan alessandro alatri is a roman director who has understood properly and fortunately printed in a film the milanese philosophy br br film tells the story of a standard in career milanese couple starting from the birth to the death the birth wedding is so typical out of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash back story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love life is hard in the urbe of milan and after the sweeties old days became tougher and tougher then finally the product a child who instead of strengthen further the couple relationship it weaken because the selfish effect typical of a nowadays metropolis personality the advertising environment with all the creative under stress atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot we are losing the life values and this is well and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp movie from the senza pelle's director br br the actors are well chosen stefania rocca nice and well characterised and a positive surprise an unexpected good fabio volo well known by the trash tv serie le iene br br rating 7 10,1
i remember liking this more than nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me laputa whose title seems to have affected its release in the u s to avoid confusion to its wide hispanic audiences has the cartoonish knack of the director's debut production conan in fact pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of conan who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet then started running this makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch the techie fans of nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out laputa the only exception may be the robot unlike princess mononoke and valley of the winds the theme in laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism if it has a theme at all it's anti warfare the importance of living naturally this is related with the flying castle is dismissably shortly discussed and not really followed through overall i now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel good and corny,1
this was a very well scripted movie great fun if you just want a stupid film not great production value ok the sound really sucked but the performance of danny masterson more than makes up for it br br watch this movie and laugh out loud,1
it seems evident from this adaptation that he did not not only did he leave the plot behind he made up his own the things that he chose to leave in were so ridiculously unbelievable that i was happy he chose to leave out some of the most important parts of the novel the plot was hazy inconsistent and choppy to say the least i don't want to say anything mean spirited about the actors but they can't act dickens is difficult of course but this is pathetic micawber was nothing more than a mid nineteenth century kramer and the less said about betsy trotwood the better if you want to see the real copperfield watch the wonderful 1999 bbc adaptation as for the screenplay writer i think he read the cliff's notes,0
i saw this film in winnipeg recently appropriate given the location used i first read lawrence's book back in the 70's and for me it's always been a very powerful picture of the trials of aging in our society it resonated when i was young and it resonates even more now when the film came out i was keen to see if the story could survive and was thoroughly impressed especially with ellen burstyn's performance she manages to give us a complete human being even though the character is generally cranky and judgmental someone that you wouldn't want to live with it's great to be able to see favourite characters come to life so authentically,1
go see this movie for the gorgeous imagery of andy goldsworthy's sculptures and treat yourself to a thoroughly eye opening and relaxing experience the music perfectly complements the footage but never draws attention towards itself some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot but consider this why would you expand on this in a movie if you can read andy's musings at length in his books or attend one of his excellent lectures this medium is much more suitable to show the ephemeral nature of the artist's works and is used expertly in this respect,1
this is a slow moving story no action no crazy suspense no abrupt surprises if you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey dovey romance don't waste your time and money br br on the other hand if you're into dialog masterful story telling thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie i recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert though because the pace the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood it's truly fantastic i really mean that br br ethan hawke and julie delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but thankfully the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural warm and tender they act and feel each other out from the very beginning making you feel as an intruder br br in their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner i thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but i may be underestimating their intelligence still it did not ruin the movie br br the overall story is very simple which i think gives the movie it's charm and ultimately it's power br br bottom line the movie's flow is slow the dialog is fascinating the story builds gently systematically and substantive the build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding,1

kurosawa weaves a tale that has a cast of characters as diverse as any shakespearean drama and the acting is true to the story with each star playing their role as a part of the larger tale it is touching funny and intriguing in all parts the character development is near perfect the cinematography is vivid and engaging and the story draws you in br br i would like to say that the samurai freaks and those obsessed with late 18th and 19th century dynastic tales of japan may snub this film as not kurosawa's best work perhaps not his best but even at his worst kurosawa is better than many of the best this story is so based in elevating the mundane lives of ordinary people in a time of great change that it is timeless despite being set in the not so distant past br br i would heartily recommend this to any movie buff and especially to those who are likely to continue on to read the novel on which the film is based,1
made by french brothers jules and giddeon naudet and narrated by robert de niro and firefighter james hanlon this is a compelling and heartbreaking tale of how new york's finest shone on it's darkest day i first saw this when i was a young naive 12 year old and at that age it still touched me knowing how serious 9 11 really was seeing this expanded the whole effect of 9 11 we were finding out who the heroes were how there everyday lives were composed and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save their selves these brave men put their lives on the line and watching this just increases my admiration for them watch if you can this is the best documentary i have personally ever seen,1
the odd couple is one of those movies that far surpasses its reputation people all know it they hum the theme song they complain of living with a sloppy oscar or a fastidious felix but they're under selling the film without knowing it this isn't just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy it's a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce it's also damn funny from start to finish but it's the kind of comedy that arises from realistic stressful and just plain awful situations so some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit uncomfortable but i think its verisimilitude is its strength besides matthau's bulldog face just cracks me up my favorite comedy by a country mile,1
the first and only time i saw the woman in black was i think the only time to my knowledge it appeared on tv back in 1989 it was christmas eve and my father and i were watching it in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight service in the village church i was quite young at the time but i'm not sure who was more terrified walking through the church yard to the entrance of the church that night me or my father br br there are many factors about this film that make it so creepy but i think 0ne of them is the fact that there's not much in the way of a sound track that plays in the background of nearly every hollywood movie so every creak thump and bang is more amplified in your head as there's no distraction another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories there's no jump factor involved like things bouncing out the closet so it makes it not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is going on this is a clever medium as nothing scares you more than your own mind running riot thinking whats around the corner or behind the door br br a superb ghost story i've never seen anything that can match it and with all the dross thats repeated over and over on tv i cant believe the bbc has deleted it after to my knowledge only one showing,1
this has got to be one of the worst fillums i've ever seen and i've seen a few it is slow boring amateurish not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot the actors do not act i can't blame them they have been given a script of such utter banality all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes which has nothing to do with the evil goings on in summersisle br br there is not one moment in this film that rings true not an honest line nor a single instant where one is moved the nicholas cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations i have no doubt that i was seeing a suffering man up there but it was nicholas cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career,0
a tour deforce ok the kid that plays oliver is a bit toooooo sweet starting with the great cinematography color costumes and most impressive performances this is a must see movie i have seen several adaptations of this great novel but this one stands above them all and its a musical to boot it is a masterful fagan never leaving his character to do a song you never really know if you like him or not the same feeling i got in the book in other versions you hate him from start to finish bill sykes when you read the book hes a mean one and so he is in this movie oliver reed was masterful his wife directed this masterpiece i went and saw his last movie gladiator based on his many fine performances not to see the headliners the music fits the times and the mood who will buy this beautiful movie you should,1
first let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots i really enjoyed them i really enjoyed this movie but i got to say next to pierce brosnan greg kinear is pretty lackluster brosnan melts into this character so well that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond it also shows his range and depth as an actor it is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year i found the characters to be well crafted the twist in the middle i felt was especially good i also liked how the characters come off realistically so many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walking stereotypes i like the different approaches this movie takes i think of sideways when i think of this movie but i think this is more watchable and a better movie overall,1
i saw this piece of garbage on amc last night and wonder how it could be considered in any way an american movie classic it was awful in every way how badly did jack lemmon james stewart and the rest of the cast need cash that they would even consider doing this movie,0
this movie resonated with me on two levels as a kid i was evacuated from london and planted on unwilling hosts in a country village while i escaped the bombing and had experiences which produced treasured memories for example hearing a nightingale sing one dark night for the very first time and enjoying a life i never could have had in london i missed my family and worried about them tom is an old man whose wife and child have both died and who lives alone in a small country village as an old man who is now without a wife whose kids have gotten married and live far away in another province i am again sometime lonely the boy's mother is a religious fanatic with very odd ideas of raising a child since a deep affection has grown between old tom oakley and this young lad tom goes in search of him and finally rescues him from very odd and dangerous circumstances at the end of the story there is great tension since due to some bureaucratic ruling it seems that the child is going to lose someone who has developed a loving relationship with him,1
the plainsman is an entertaining western no doubt a classic which is actual even today gary cooper is wild bill hickok ideal for the role together with john wayne and james stewart they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation jean arthur is great as calamity jane nobody that i know played it better than her even if might not be historically accurate the film manages to capture the most important about hickok and about the time it takes place sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that is what demille does here the friendship of hickok with buffalo bill the selling of rifles to the indians by a great manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have because of the end of the civil war custer and little big horn the uneasy relationship between buffalo bill's wife a religious woman with hickok a man who had killed plenty also the unusual love affair between hickok and calamity all this makes 'the plainsman' a non conventional and interesting film anthony quinn has a very short appearance that already shows what a great actor he was going to become a lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time,1
i had no background knowledge of this movie before i bought it but it sounded cool and i've been wanting to see a really kick butt viking movie for awhile now alas this film was not what i was looking for i had hoped for the best but instead was delivered a boring nordic soap opera that seemed to drag on too long despite its 84 minute running time the film's premise is intriguing enough it's about a viking warlord who defies his god and odin is so enraged that he curses the warlord's son named barek to death and rebirth as a berserker this barek guy is then forced to live enraged insane and violent lifetime after lifetime the movie is filmed competently enough with some rich cinematography and quasi good performances by the actors but again i found myself bored and questioning when this dribble would end the filmmakers had a chance to make something rather entertaining and semi unique but they dropped the ball perhaps it could've been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics thrown in such as gratuitous nudity and lots of gore i mean we are talking about berserkers here aren't we vikings were supposed to be bad enough what with all the raping and pillaging so aren't berserkers supposed to be even more extreme all in all unless you're a fan of the young and restless etc or are yourself in fact an insane berserker who likes self torture i'd probably steer clear of this drab piece of celluloid,0
an ok flick set in mexico about a hit man scott glenn who hitches a ride with struggling american writer and his mexican girlfriend after a hit he pays them to take him to the border  but things get out of hand br br it starts well enough but quickly struggles and dies br br spoiler br br the eventual relationship twist is badly set up and difficult to believe an absence of passion and essentially no reasoning behind her leaving one man for the other made it ridiculous and the ending was predictable and dull br br end spoiler br br harvey keitel is the us agent on the hit man's trail but he seems a little confused as to how boring and slow the script is,0
simply the best estonian film that i have ever seen although it is made by a finnish director ilkka järvi laturi tallin pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold a national treasure that belongs to the republic of estonia but at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions of many eastern european countries at that time in the early 90s soviet union fell into pieces and many countries such as estonia became independent now the conditions may be better in most of those countries but in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the soviet era had left them as inheritance and many of them still do at least on some level br br tallinn pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and with a well written script the actors are also very good especially jüri järvet perhaps the best known estonian actor plays snaut in tarkovski's solaris playing and old gangster who's slowly becoming tired of his way of life but the most astonishing performance comes from monika mäger a child actor playing terje a boyish girl in her early teens whose presence in the plot is quite essential and her name is not even mentioned in the imdb credit list w br br there are not many films in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time but tallinn pimeduses does that unfortenately järvi laturi's other films are far from this kind of achievements his first one kotia päin was too artificial and his latest history is made at night was just a weird mess,1
i was blown away by the re imagined battlestar galactica a show that always kept me guessing and brought me to tears on more than one occasion a hardened sci fi fan i like to think i can pick out the good stuff from the bs and this was good stuff br br as such when i first heard about the prospect of a prequel series some months ago i got a sick feeling in my gut i was afraid that the formula that made battlestar so successful would be reused in caprica which wouldn't work at all bsg's story of a mournful ragged band of survivors trapped aboard decaying star ships and guided by prophetic vision and a sequence of pseudo miracles was perfectly complimented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors br br caprica feels different where bsg takes place after the fall of a great civilization caprica portrays that civilization in it's cold and decadent heyday the overall vibe i got from caprica was similar to that of minority report minus excessive and counterproductive theatricality in true bsg form caprica has in it's first few hours of programming already tackled the issues of religious freedom racism the morality of playing god and the nature of the human soul br br the casting for caprica is also excellent each character is unique and deep from the obsessive and distant scientist turned entrepreneur to his troubled and willful daughter each actor and actress throws themselves into their respective roles br br music which was used so powerfully in bsg also plays a significant role in caprica battlestar's powerful rolling drums and mournful duduks served it's themes very well caprica uses a more orchestral sound which gives the show it's own feeling quite distinct from either of it's predecessors br br the new caprica is definitely it's own show pulling from the battlestar franchise only as much as it needs i look forward to the full series,1
most movies i can sit through easily even if i do not particularly like the movie i am the type of person who recognizes great films even if i do not like the genre this is the first movie i could not stand to watch cat in the hat is the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen a lot of movies the acting is okay myers is good as the cat it's just that he is really annoying the silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous even for the children in the audience the plot drags on and on and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue the witty parental remarks are disgusting not funny i remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to well a type of person people call a ho even though the movie is really short it seemed to last forever do not waste your time i know small kids who hated this movie if children can't stand it i do not know how any adults can i would like to fume more about this film but i do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it i hated it so in summary do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this see a good movie br br 1 10 stars the lowest review i have ever given a movie,0
the good earth is a great movie that you don't hear much about anymore there are a lot of big disasters and events but it is also a non passionate love story all of this happens in a little over two hours which is short by today's standards the special effects and costumes are very good for the time period br br i am surprised that luise rainer received an oscar for such a limiting role she basically only has three emotions submissive hungry and heart broken br br the performances by the asian and asian american actors are terrific br br,1
about halfway through i realized i didn't care about these characters in the least however i watched a bit more anyway regrettably i came back the next day and finished it i shouldn't have bothered br br if you know anything about the film beforehand you know that the lead character will be a plane crash survivor and the title gives you a pretty good idea of what's gonna happen afterward he's gonna get on the phone and call people about it that was almost as bad as snakes on a plane another bad aviation catastrophe flick br br i realize this is an old film and the acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than today but even by those standards the acting was embarrassing these weren't characters they were stereotypes i suspect this movie was more than anything an attempt by bette davis to help her husband's gary merrill career to no avail however i have seen oak trees display more genuine emotion than he did br br davis' playing the happy cripple i e a non glamorous role was probably looked on as an edgy and bold career move it wasn't it was just boring she was a kind of tiny tim in the film making trask merrill's character see the truth about love and forgiveness although she was less winsome than tiny tim calmly dispensing wisdom about life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband had just died br br the final scene where trask calls his wife back in iowa to reconcile was so affected and over acted on both ends of the phone line i almost cringed i had to remind myself that these people actually got paid for what they were doing in this film br br i noticed a lot of people seem to have enjoyed this movie if you found it uplifting that's great but frankly i just found it bad there are plenty of old movies from the golden age of hollywood that were far better written and acted,0
outstanding film of 1943 with paul lukas giving an oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to america from europe as the nazi menace deepened br br the usual terrific bette davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of 1943 br br encounting treachery around them lukas successfully deals with the situation he knows he must return to europe on a clandestine mission and return he does br br davis again pulls out all the stops with a katharine hepburn like shedding of tears when they must part resolute she knows that her older son must follow him on his path to liberty br br a wonderful film highlighting american positive propaganda against a wicked foe,1
imagine if you could bring things back to life with just one touch as soon as i first heard that my attention was locked on the trailer and after the first episode i found my self in love with this show a modern day fairy tale that brings my spirits up and holds my attention throughout the entire show i think the acting and casting is just perfect each character brings something unique to the show that adds to it's perfection even the one time villains manage to overflow with a unique sense from the bee man to the guy who can swallow kittens they never seem to let me down and the deaths that would normally lead to a depressing moment often end up being purely comical such as an exploding scratch sniff book br br even with the large amount of crime shows we have now a days daisies is one of the few that really stands out from the rest being not just a mystery but a love story comedy and a fairy tale with a hint of drama all baked into one wonderful pie err show br br what really shocked me was the fact that it was on abc for years i never had a reason to turn to abc but this brought me back each week with a smile on my face it was as if pushing daisies brought abc back to life for me but just like that after two seasons a few awards a large fan base and positive responses from critics the show has been dropped it seems as though ned has touched abc again and forever killed it for me i will always be a fan of this show though and i recommend this to anyone who likes a lot of talking and a lot of love from the shows they watch,1
there is a scene near the beginning after a shootout where horses are running if something red catches your eye it is because a white van is parked behind a bush by the trail i thought i had seen bad but this is it a white van in a western did they not catch this oh well and i paid top dollar at the rental it will make you want to grab your buddies and have them all put in 10 grand and make a better movie the talking was so so slow the acting was mostly ok but couldn't be taken seriously due to the poor nature of the filming there is a door at the sheriffs that looks like a door today with the particular trimming i say watch this movie and move cabin boy into 2 on the worst of all time,0

this ensemble piece about adults who return to the formulative summer camp of their youth was a very quiet entrant and exiter to the cinemas in the autumn of 1993 i'd say that was a shame but then again some of the better movies are quiet releases that don't get much hype or praise br br diane lane kevin pollack elizabeth perkins vincent spano julie warner bill paxton kimberly williams matt craven and alan arkin who is painfully good here are the group of actors who flesh out these roles as people who have grown old with good bad and funny memories of summers gone past this film covers the gambit of emotions mostly pleasant and the film never hammers away at the viewer to feel what the characters are feeling preferring to allow the viewer to enter into the memories on their own since i am a movie viewer who bristles at bluntly brazen manipulation in films this is something that i appreciate from writer director mike binder br br this film's a great cheap rent a good main rent and even a pretty sit in a theater flick you might run across this on tv and i would definitely suggest a look see,1
relying on the positive reviews above we saw a free screening of this last night now i know that filmmakers plant positive reviews because there is no way an objective individual could have written these destined to become a 'cult classic' the theater was packed apparently with friends and families of the production crew because only a few of us walked out by the first hour br br the songs were the most literal i've ever heard in a musical  don't take the short cut honey there's a wolf in the woods debi mazar's eyes blinked furiously as she struggled to sing fortunately most of the tunes lasted for only a few lines br br now whoever plays the wolf in this tale should be charming and seductive instead we get joey fatone ex n'syncer living up to his last name as he's not aged well he's not exactly lithe with his extra 50 pounds and junior high school quality makeup and out of tune singing seriously this guy was in vocal group the rest of the actors are semi adequate but can't do much about the unimaginative script you know it is possible to write for adults and children at the same time  see under pixar br br on the positive side the virtual sets looked nice and were well integrated with the actors and it wasn't as offensive as crash,0
without question this film has to be one of the greatest in cinematic history i have it watched too many times to remember and each time it is like i am seeing the film for the first time br br where does one begin br br meena kumari's central performance is undoubtedly one of the finest of her career followed closely by sahib bibi aur ghulam and phool aur pathar each movement and nuance of her performance makes any other bollywood heroine pale into significance her masterly interpretation of kathak coupled with her grace tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery of urdhu is like nothing ever seen on the bollywood screen br br pakeezah is perhaps the most stylised interpretation of the human condition the photography sumptuous cinematography and mise en scene are so charged with symbolism and meaning that the viewer is left breathless br br naushads music is unsurpassed his knowledge of the music of the courtesan gharanas is incredible and the way in which he punctuates the narrative with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic melodies is indeed remarkable br br my only advice to anyone who seriously enjoys the spectacle of total cinema should watch this epic mediation on life and art,1
an attempt at crossover to appeal to those who don't appreciate opera exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time it fails badly all that is desirable in this movie is the opera and one can best find a recording of pavarotti doing what he does best the plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his throat which has suddenly become troublesome br br only because it came out so long ago is it largely forgotten like most opera stars pavarotti is a decent actor and has stage presence aside from his singing talent and nothing that he does in this movie negates that opinion his culpability lies in not rejecting the horrid script perhaps because great operas can have silly stories he tolerated this one br br who knows except those involved do we need to know br br the plot is weak and trite this movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick off a few juicy tidbits the opera music hanging above the mud we have other ways in which to appreciate the great pavarotti and this one isn't one of them just get one of his many superb opera or vocal concert recordings and recognize the master tenor where he is most suited br br it would be one of imdb's 100 worst films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes it would fit neatly in a list including several efforts of singers actors models and athletes to exploit their popularity through film very often it all goes badly wrong due to incompetent acting or a horrible script pavarotti would have been a decent actor had he not shown such a superb voice however effective he is as an actor opera requires it not even jimmy stewart could have rescued this turkey of a script br br i give it a polite 3 of 10 because someone may have become a fan of pavarotti's singing and of opera because of this movie,0
reading a wide variety of scoop reviews over the past few days i walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from woody happily i couldn't have been more wrong granted woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two but woody the writer director is in fine form and found a credible way to integrate his 70 year old self into the story judging from the laughter and guffaws the audience ate up allen's one liners and dialogue in a way that i haven't seen in several years br br in a movie landscape dominated by software approved story arcs twentysomething tastes and assembly line formula fare for kiddies it's a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see allen pursuing his highly personal and still rewarding path,1
the true story of a bunch of junkies robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs jewelry guns and money some would say this is the tragic tale of america in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and aids honestly this is just regular people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man what is the second part of their master plan once they have his stuff they'll sit around and get high again great plan even if you don't know the story there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises the fact that cox tries to make some kind of folk heroes out of these characters with party scenes and a montage of their loot is weak and insulting the story was better off with a more straight forward approach as it is this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers the bigger story in more ways than one is john holmes he is the center of this story anyway this movie should have been all about him his life he was the one in wonderland with the wonders about to fade away br br p s although it isn't official boogie nights is a better version of holmes life it isn't entirely factual but it's far more enjoyable,1
so being a fairly deep fan of horror movies it's been a while since i've seen one that really made me jump or fidget nervously br br definitely going to get this on dvd when it comes out a hell of a lot better than the ring the thing that i don't get is that so many people that we talkd with after the movie thought that it was horrible well if that's what you think then so be it i know what i liked and it takes a fair amount to get me to actually feel scared so i have to say that this one is worth watching br br now you might be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and tidy line because the plot goes back an forth a little bit to help build the story i think that if it was shown in chronological order it would have ruined the whole thing br br i'm actually glad that this movie had very little bloody messes in it maybe the rest of you studio writers and whathaveyous will realize that you don't have to splash the red stuff all over the set to make people afraid,1

since september of last year i have been borrowing four to six films each week from the harold washington library which boasts an impressive dvd collection the hwl truly is a circulating library three quarters of its films are out at any given time recently i was thrilled to find the short films of david lynch yesterday knowing little about the animated series i picked up dumbland i'm here to report that for david lynch fans watching the eight episodes is half an hour well spent br br the most remarkable feature of these brief pieces are their soundtracks each episode has its own rhythm respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion outrageous voices accent pauses' ends physical violence supplies the beats chirping birds and buzzing sockets brush along the edges many other elements fill out the orchestra the pacing of the crude animation often keeps in sync with the sound but the soundtrack itself struck me as lynch's primary interest in creating and disseminating this work in a way these eight shorts are unique lynchian rhythms br br that said the situations are odd ugly profound dumb and funny as hell and there's enough space within them to reflect on how absurd we humans can be i can't say that i'll watch the collection again but for anyone who revelled in the movements that is the suite inland empire dumbland is worth half an hour of your time,1
well of course not women are overly sensitive and needy on average which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore though not pseudo artistically extravagantly or blatantly dwelt on unlike many of you i have only seen la maman et la putain twice as many good films i noticed my opinion of it improved after a second viewing all that i know is what i have seen and have yet to delve into further exploits until i myself have acquired the dvd i have yet to figure out precisely why i enjoy this movie so much but really what do i care why though i'm sure i could and will form some wonderful explanation all right so you may disagree perhaps it is a bit boring at times i'm not an expert the blonde reminds me of a lovely grushenka,1

two kinds of movies we like are 1 westerns and 2 movies from 30 or 40 years ago we ought to have liked a man called sledge but br br but this picture is disagreeable annoying and stupid from start to finish since there is nobody in the story good or bad to warm up to there is nobody to motivate the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested no camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it sledge has a pretty girl friend but there's no reason why she slobbers all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this no account pig br br the film also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score and from extremely bad writing and direction by vic morrow br br of the last 30 older movies rented from netflix or video vault this was the rock bottom the only true dud in the bunch,0
one shot one kill no exceptions a must see if you are into marines or snipers two big thumbs up great overall storyline great camera work good drama action details and more pretty close to the real thing but this isn't a film to breakdown and pick out the editing faults this is to sit back and have a good 99 mins the plot has some depth but this movie isn't really about making you think its about enjoying the sniper lifestyle and action sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good follow ups but the first is still the best overall movie tom berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper life the plain of dealing with all of the death must see for sniper fans,1

a wonderful film by powell and pressburger whose work i now want to explore more the film is about what we perceive as real and what is real and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another beautifully shot and acted although david niven doesn't seem to be 27 years old as his character claims to be fun to see a very young richard attenborough this film made me think while i was watching it and afterwards,1
macarthur is a great movie with a great story about a great mangeneral douglas macarthur this is of course the story of one of america's great military figures and a figure made familiar to me from the earliest moments of my memory though there is a continuity issue there may be others e g macarthur's speech portrayed in the film as his 1962 address to the u s military academy on accepting the thayer award did not contain the phrase old soldiers never die they just fade away that was in his speech to congress upon his dismissal by president truman in 1951 for his alleged insubordination these two did not see eye to eye gregory peck is im peck able as the general who vowed he would return to the philippines in world war ii the film moves quickly and easily with the general his family and his staff from the beginning of the second world war to the end of his service career this film would be of much greater significance to one familiar with both ww ii and the korean war nevertheless peck's portrayal of this great man who fought the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can is a memorable one indeed in war there is no substitute for victory,1
my friends and i saw this film about a week ago and i feel it absolutely necessary to tell all the world or at least those who will read this that this movie is not only on the top five worst movies i have ever seen but actually has the honor of being the number one i have seen quite a lot of films but none beats this one in being stupid you could say i suffered watching it my only excuse is that we were waiting for a few hours and weren't able to go anywhere else without freezing our buttocks off i do not recommend this to anyone at first i thought we were watching some really bad porn movie but figured out after 10 minutes that is not the case it is not a comedy it is not drama it is not action it is not horror it is just horrible,0
words can hardly describe it so i'll be brief the thief of bagdad was my favorite movie as a child and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me i loved this film from the first moment i saw it when i was a boy of six who had started reading the arabian nights i remember walking into the tv room in the middle of sabu's battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled br br rarely has so much beauty magic and wonder been captured on film sabu and john justin are superb as the dashing heros conrad veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain jaffar and rex ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie georges perinal's photography is some of the best use of technicolor one of the three credited directors is michael powell a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films including a matter of life and death aka stairway to heaven and the red shoes he is one of the true masters of the camera right up there with david lean akira kurosawa and orson welles br br as with all great works of art the beauty of the thief of bagdad lies in the detail every frame has its own magical charm the story never lags and the characters and their actions are always involving here is a film that will never grow old,1
the complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women i am okay with these night time soaps like grey's anatomy or ugly betty or west wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end however when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men taye diggs tim daly and chris lowell into sexual tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so called little hospital it seems like general hospital or a female counterpart to baywatch that was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea that this is a high brow show or something men will watch is unrealistic,0
because 'cruel' would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers where do you even begin in a spout of b tchiness i'm going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie scratch that nearly does not belong in that sentence i can't think of even one character who was portrayed well although in all fairness it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way still the girl who played katherine whose name i purposefully don't include i'm pretending she doesn't exist remains one of the worst actors i've ever seen only eclipsed by the guy who played sebastian the story was god awful it attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways pretty much every part of it was pointless though i will admit grudgingly that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise and the ending was at least slightly humorous but this film is up there with the worst i've seen don't watch it just don't there is absolutely no value in watching it none it only takes away the enjoyment of the first,0
the confidential part was meant to piggy back on the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name while the labor racketeering theme tied in with headline congressional investigations of the day however despite the a grade b movie cast and some good script ideas the movie plods along for some 73 minutes it's a cheap jack production all the way what's needed to off set the poor production values is some imagination especially from uninspired director sidney salkow a few daylight location shots for example would have helped relieve the succession of dreary studio sets a stylish helmsman like anthony mann might have done something with the thick ear material but salkow treats it as just another pay day exercise too bad that brian keith's typical low key style doesn't work here coming across as merely wooden and lethargic at the same time cult figure elisha cook jr goes over the top as a wild eyed drunk clearly salkow is no actor's director but you've got to hand it to that saucy little number beverly garland who treats her role with characteristic verve and dedication too bad she wasn't in charge my advice skip it unless you're into ridiculous bar girls who do nothing else but knock back whiskeys in typical strait jacketed 50's fashion,0
don't watch this serbian documentary and serbian propaganda look out for this documentary and you will see facts and truth http imdb com title tt0283181 br br the death of yugoslavia documentary series of five episodes is a painstakingly compiled and researched account of the extended mass bloodshed which marked the end of the old federal yugoslavia and spanned almost the entire first half of the 1990's it includes a huge wealth of news footage and interviews with involved parties both yugoslav and otherwise the only real improvement which could be made to this amazing achievement would be the inclusion of later developments in the balkans since the program was made this was indeed done in the late 1990's for a repeat showing on bbc television but the addition of some even more recent events would help to complete this admirably detailed and fulsome piece of work perhaps another whole episode might be warranted the very succinct title of this documentary was made all the more appropriate by the eventual abandonment of the term yugoslavia by the now named federal republic of serbia and montenegro a much belated and formal admission of that which occurred years before br br not fiction like in yugoslavia the avoidable war 1999,0
several features of this film immediately date it the sound is rather shrill and one realizes what great strides have been accomplished in sound reproduction in the ensuing years the language of the dialogue is rather quaint and unnatural and the acting is still reminiscent of its transition from the stage techniques br br bette davis always gives a strong performance in all her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career i do feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression i think it is the assumed cockney accent that does not ring true for me br br somerset maughan loves to delve into human relationships of great dramatic intensity which will please all movie goers as in so many of her character roles bette davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a viper full of fiery hatred leslie howard is well cast as the withdrawn english artist with a club foot desperately seeking a partner and making a bad choice in a scheming little waitress br br towards the end of the film the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street they cross through the traffic completely oblivious to a multitude of horns and whistles screaming at them this scene is possibly meant to be funny but i find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film it is probably construed to send you home with a smile on your face and after all as far as we can see and hope for it is a happy ending,1

surprisingly well made little movie short in length at about 90 minutes for a low budget movie very well made plot is slow to unravel cast is excellent especially elizabeth van meter as the girlfriend with tourette's syndrome,1
i admit i had some trepidation when i first saw the previews for this film was vh 1 treading on hollow ground here i mean harris and quinn don't really look or even sound like john or paul but i have to admit this film really surprised me it's far from the exploitation film i expected instead it's a character study a low key whimsical and ultimately bittersweet look at friendship and the ultimate lesson we all learn it's hard if not impossible to capture what we once had and what has passed us by,1
the biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say zues takes dutch commands but she is speaking german to him the 2 languishes are completely different its like saying well he takes french commands and start talking spanish br br james belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest the role just doesn't fit him even if its mend to be a comedy br br to many stereotype predicable stuff typical comment or comebacks br br if you don't look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on tv but i wouldn't suggesting renting it,0
this is a nice little movie with a nice story that plays the most important role in the entire movie br br it's a quite intriguing dramatic story with also romance present in it the story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up the characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors normally i'm not a too big fan of the asian acting style but the acting in this movie was simply good br br of course the movie is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies produced in the west in a way this movie is more advanced already with its approach than the western movies made during the same era br br i only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better for a movie that is considered a kind of an art house movie this movie is certainly lacking in some well looking sequences this was obviously a quite cheap movie to make and it got made quite generically not that this is a bad thing it just prevent this movie from truly distinct itself and raising itself above the genre br br but oh well this movie is all about its well constructed story and characters that are in it in that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint br br 8 10,1
the poor dvd video quality is the only reason why i gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10 that could have been so much better this movie deserves it br br this is truly a movie that covers several themes simultaneously if you do not like movies about serial killers but are fascinated by the astonishing bureaucratic culture in the former sovjet union this movie is a must see anyway br br i can't compare it to silence of the lambs for several reasons the way the serial killer is portrayed has been done far much better in citizen x you see several details of his private life because you travel along with the killer which gives you some idea of the source of his constant anger and sexual frustration br br the only other movie i have seen that is as realistic as this one was henry portrait of a serial killer if you were fascinated by that movie you definitely need to take a look at citizen x,1
most people 36 gave this movie a 10 and those who don't are being too critical or maybe expected something else this is one of my favorite movies from the 80's it grows on you and has it all i just got it on dvd and 20 years later it still does not disappoint having plenty of action drama romance and even comedy add to that the great car chases automatic weapon shootouts and lots of stuff blowing up and you have a fun edge of your seat experience you will even be humming or whistling the main theme song for days after seeing this br br you can watch this movie with your wife gf and you will both enjoy it lots the premise is that of a paperback book hero like doc savage really existing and helping people fight evil so he can write the story is almost true to life here the actor jake speed is also a director producer and writer of many films in this film jake speed the character is an indiana jones adventurer type he usually uses his head to get out of sticky situations but will sometimes resorts to brute firepower yay and sheer dumb luck too keep an eye out for his one james bond hi tech equipment the ultimate road warrior suv dropping out of the sky br br the heroine is the very beautiful young love interest from the early jim carey vampire movie once bitten and here she is a little older and still a knockout even compared to her teenage blonde little sister br br the bad guys are real bad men and are the worst lowlife villainous scum you love to hate the ending is just perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel sadly never made but you can just imagine what would happen next br br you have to see this movie just because it will entertain and amuse you and that's worth the price of a ticket,1
this movie is lame and not funny at all the plot doesn't even make sense some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter gets sucked through it or something then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she's more interested in her new girlfriend and they stumble upon this witch spell book they want to be witches or something and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie i'm sure the topless girls doesn't hurt there either the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing who are these people and what are they doing basically this is a go camping to make out then fight a monster movie but there are a bunch of things like the other dimension and book seller than make it confusing i didn't like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal i don't recommend watching it though it was just too stupid i can't think of any part of the movie that was good,0
although nothing can compare to vampires vs zombies in any realm of film making i will attempt to judge this movie br br firstly the special effects were breath taking when there was an explosion on the television screen i thought my entire house was going to explode and when automatic machine guns were fired i thought the shells were landing on the floor right next to me simply stunning my friends br br but the scene when the jack black sound a like is giving the worst monologue i have ever heard i nearly killed myself but don't worry since he was getting blazed in the movie he can pass his awful acting off on i must be high seriously he must have watched himself mindlessly babbling about non congruent thoughts that make absolutely no sense and just added that he must be high to justify his awful acting well if you can say that to excuse terrible acting then if you talked to the writers directors executive producers sponsors you will probably get the same response seriously br br with a production team called shock o rama i was shocked i didn't place a sawed off shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after this shockingly terrible excuse for a movie was played br br if you want to see this movie then you should be murdered br br yours truly br br the general,0
this is the first guinea pig film from japan and this is the sickest in my opinion a bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her and at this point i will say that these films are not real they are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible br br the scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases for example when they kick the girl in the floor we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl and how stupid this looks the sound effects are also unrealistic and don't make sense other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours the ripping off of fingernails worms placed on the wounds in the girl's body the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant this first entry is the sickest and most amateurish guinea pig although it is not as bloody as the next part flowers of flesh and blood which tries to be as shocking as possible br br guinea pig devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest thing i've seen and the closest thing to snuff there is this is still of course faked s n t uff the only difference to genuine snuff film is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film i cannot recommend this to anyone since thi s is so s y and repulsive they who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it i watched this as a curiosity as the other parts in the series and now i know how insignificant trash these are they work only in shock level and that's not too valuable cinematic achievement devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest film i've seen and mermaid in a manhole guinea pig 4 is perhaps the most disgusting film i've seen so these are pretty extreme in my book but that's all they are,0
i can see little girls enjoying this show but calling this a family show is ridiculous i'm amazed how well remembered it is after all these years it's an extremely unfunny and stupid show about widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school and others as the seasons go on all of the plot lines generally have a really dumb lesson in the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light unfunny joke as for the actors i didn't like them either bob saget was painfully unfunny as the dad with the mom responsibilities dave coulier is a one note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid and he's horrid john stamos was the most tolerable character but he was so clichéd it was hard to watch him the oldest girl dj on the show was a genuinely bad actress and showed no emotion ever the middle girl stephanie was too clichéd as the annoying little sister the youngest girl michelle showed what bad actresses the olsen twins were you can always tell when they are switching them off the plot lines to too many story lines were so unrealistically stupid it's cringe worthy this is a family show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love and though those are needed for a show about a family they overdid it way too much this will be remembered as my least favorite sit com from the 80's and 90's br br my rating terrible show tvg 30 mins,0
now here is a film that if made in australia would have easily been a comedy sadly and annoyingly here it is flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from lala land how did the di erector get it so wrong well mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliché but somehow cute or is that cliché piled upon cliché no value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to gus van sant's gerry and with a title like the fluffer how is it all such a lead weight well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he didn't get to burt and boogie first that he had to make his own convoluted and undeveloped apart from the 'unrequited love's a bore' theme left over from a faded streisand lyric we have only moody beefcake and tv serial level storyline left the un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the gerries into to desert and gets stuck there in oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called moneyshot originally filmed as the venus factory it too suffered from an auteur more awful than orson so they re filmed half of it got a ruthless tv editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minutes and hey presto comedy tonight a lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up i guess the fluffer stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform i can understand why,0
an unfunny unworthy picture which is an undeserving end to peter sellers' career it is a pity this movie was ever made,0
this isn't the first time stanley blurred the distinction between genres to such great effect either in dr strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments slow burning madness and attempting to kill one's family isn't hilarious of course but the dialogue is very knowing five months of peace is just what i want and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit but is spine chilling when you factor in the other br br i disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on jack torrance in the filmed version the cues nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son the environment that he is in however then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness in much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return he may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives but to me the overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off br br kubrick's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film and the unpredictable force of nature that is jack nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you when he explodes you won't be sure how far he can go together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic if you want a great viewing experience then this is an example that well and truly shines,1
this appalling film somehow saw the light of day in 1988 it looks and sounds as if it had been produced 20 or 30 years earlier and features some of the worst songs ever included in a major motion picture i weep for the parents and children who paid top dollar to see this,0
i don't know where to begin this movie feels a lot like one of those cheap saturday morning kids shows that they used to make back in the late eighties early nineties sort of like captain power or the power rangers it's full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy sounding secret agencies and villains br br the acting is so bad that it's not even funny the direction is terrible and there is little to now continuity it seems as if someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a plot br br perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early on when several villains plant an explosive device in an agents car for some reason even though the device is clearly stated as being remote detonated the bad guys decide to chase her down on their motorcycles as she drives away this chase carries on all the while with the bad guys doing ludicrous and completely pointless bike stunts standing up on the bikes doing wheelies and so on at one point a crash happens and one of the attackers is thrown from his bike we see the bike clearly cgi thrown over the agents car but the rider has vanished then a few seconds later the rider and bike return apparently unscathed by the crash at this point even though the car has an explosive device planted in it the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving past then blow up her car which was also clearly done with cgi sound confusing it is and so is the rest of the movie br br i might point out that when i say cgi we aren't talking about lord of the rings type cgi here we're talking the cheap cheesy power rangers type cgi actually i think it would have been done better on power rangers br br why savini and todd did this movie i will never know i can only assume they did for money as a favor to someone or because they were blackmailed into it probably the last one,0
this is the first movie i've seen of john singleton and he is a pretty good director the movie starts out with a bunch of incoming freshman and it shows what happens to several of them omar epps plays a track star with a partial scholarship and having a hard time keeping up with his work he is friends with ice cube and beings dating tyra banks kristy swanson is a rich girl who is date raped and becomes friends with jennifer connelly who is a lesbian and isn't sure about which way to go michael rapaport is a kid from idaho who falls in with a group of neo nazis and their leader is cole hauser those are the three main characters and laurence fishburne is a political science professor who tries to help them it's a great film and it's unfortunate that the studio had to make several cuts to the movie,1
watching this was like getting a large mackerel slapped in your face over and over again even when you thought that mackerel surely can't be coming around again slap there it was i'm not sure what they were thinking this is the sort of pilot i watched and wondered did the actors know they were on a doomed ship destined to never be made into a series not only black stereotypes but swedish and indian ones as well and while blazing saddles made these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and uncomfortableness these stereotypes were just downright offensive there was no plot line the ending was slapped on and the jokes aren't still if you are a student of comedy watch this pilot to see what you shouldn't do,0
this was fun to watch spookily atmospheric and effects were pretty good considering they were bang in the middle of world war two the plot did unravel pretty quickly at the end with the villains getting their comeuppance br br it must have been a good one to watch at the local flea pit in the 1940's when they were facing the biggest threat to their liberty from the nazis well made with quite a serious message about the dangers to britain from third columnists br br but arthur askey was so annoying unfunny you just wanted him to shut up well at least i did i suppose different tastes in different times but the clowning around became tiresome if he was playing an annoying little man as part of the script then he succeeded br br a good watch and quite short at just over 80 minutes a good background for older kids too so they have an idea of what train travel in austere times was like uncomfortable slow dirty trains being thrown off for no reason surly staff,1
my god this movie was awful i can't complain about it too much i went to see it just to be grossed out it did suffice sort of it's funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was in the very very beginning where the woman is extremely vividly forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby br br i also think that it's funny that the most notable actor in the movie was the hispanic soldier who was a supporting actor in next friday everyone in the movie did a horrible acting job it was some of the worst acting i've ever paid to see br br i also expected that it would be much more gruesome than the first one it wasn't i expected it to be more gruesome because it's a sequel and horror movie sequels are usually much less successful than their predecessors i expected it to be more gruesome since gore and violence usually sell a horror movie these days grudge 2 saw 3 jeepers creepers 1 2 dead silence but it actually wasn't nearly as gruesome as the first one which was yet another disappointment br br the mutants in the first one were kind of disturbing but the filmmakers were trying so hard in this one to make them creepy that they were absolutely hilarious br br i also hated the entire concept of showing the clip of the female soldier's son on her camera phone saying i love you mommy four times it was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel even worse for her by showing it three more times for no reason this movie was a joke,0
this is a typical perfect crime thriller a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer ignoring all the clues immediately knows who guilty is the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught the result is like every single episode of columbo or murder she wrote the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock this story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book skip this one you are not missing anything,0
i'm a big fan of italian films from the seventies and i wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful barbara bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time so i did go into this film with some hopes however it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isn't going to go anywhere clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting as the title suggests the film focuses on a 'rogue' in this case one that steals womanises and smuggles stuff that's basically all the plot that this movie has the film does have a real 'seventies style' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well it sometimes seems like directors boro draskovic and gregory simpson were trying to put across some sort of point although whatever that point is doesn't come across very well seeing barbara bouchet on screen is always a pleasure and that is the case here too she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film overall the rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style but unfortunately it doesn't have much else to offer,0
if there is one film which is the worst of this year it's tashan the first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring dhoom 2 style film and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe because of it being a yashraj film or maybe seeing the cheesy promo but this film gave me a shock it was even worst then dhoom 2 and what i expected first saif's introduction which is boring then saif kareena meet kareena is so artificial and then anil kapoor oh god what he is doing in such a weird film what kinda role it is what acting is he doing his first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts then came akshay who provided some nice scenes but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff childhood romance overdose of childish rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes the ending is another joke br br vijay krishna acharya would have got 3 films more to direct if this film had worked thats the strategy of yashraj only money nothing else so vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers music vishal shekhar is ordinary br br performances akshay kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air he actually provides some engaging moments saif ali khan is irritating kareena is equally bad anil kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more rest are okay,0
think of a no budget version of china syndrome being directed by a film student who idolizes john woo and you'll get 'power play ' the idea was good but the execution acting and dialog absolutely killed it not to mention ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster sequences that was used to compensate for lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the movie br br this is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of earthquake the rather cavalier reporter going up against what should've been a more ruthless bunch of company execs is chased around town along with anyone he speaks to in order to clean whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the plant's faults br br unfortunately there is no real sense of emergency because the characters interact with much hesitancy coupled with idiotic dialog and a lot of horrible acting not to mention the viewer who may only be attracted to the movie for it's action genre appeal is forced to endure a mounting body count and ridiculous amounts of violent shoot em ups plus earthquake disaster scenes all of the focus was put in the wrong place to apologetically compensate for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that should've propelled the story it might've been much better had the filmmakers focused more on a thriller and paid greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story creepy villains a naive reporter and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrong doing afoot it is formulaic but at least it would've been entertaining,0
i just watched the incredible melting man for the second time and it was even more boring than when i first watched it i don't understand why it has become such a 'cult classic' when it is so tediously dull the opening scene looks promising when the fat nurse drops the canister of blood and runs for her dear life after this all that really happens is the melting man stalks around some woods and houses whilst having flashbacks of his life as an astronaut the makeup is quite good and his melting gooey face looks fairly realistic there is a cool scene where he throws a mans head in a river and it floats until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts open there's not much to wet yourself over though most scenes are shot in darkness and you can't really see what is happening there isn't much gore at least in the vipco dvd i watched br br no the incredible melting man is not that great at all i'll give it marks for its cheese factor but that's about it if you want a true sci fi horror cult classic watch the deadly spawn instead,0
steven seagal movies have never been oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse br br this one starts with seagal getting picked up by the fbi because he killed a few people 'in self defence' he's active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen stealth plane that will be used by the cliché 'evil english villain' that hollywood is so obsessed with including these days br br suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent the story isn't interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story characters of movie as a whole such as the 'lesbian' interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isn't even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didn't need to br br in short a terrible script with bad dialog delivered by sub par actors boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes and non relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near impossible and make the movie even worse br br save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss even if you are seagal's most ardent fan,0
i think this still is the best routine there are some others like rock's bring the pain and allen's men are pigs that are hilarious damon waynes last stand is also funny in a tearful way but this routine has no errors all the jokes are funny and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect just long enough to last 20 years i just love how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted i'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of jim carrey growing up watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool not putting in a category with ellen and newhart but something you can watch if you're bloated thanks eddie god bless,1
this movie is soooo funny the acting is wonderful the ramones are sexy the jokes are subtle and the plot is just what every high schooler dreams of doing to his her school i absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism if you like monty python you will love this film this movie is a tad bit grease esk without all the annoying songs the songs that are sung are likable you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is through this musical ranks number two in musicals to me second next to the blues brothers but please do not think of it as a musical per say seeing as how the songs are so likable it is hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene is taking place i think of this movie as more of a comedy with undertones of romance you will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager needless to say you will be reminiscing of your old high school days after seeing this film highly recommended for both the family since it is a very youthful but also for adults since there are many jokes that are funnier with age and experience,1
ok if you're a woman who's got aggression issues you might like this movie hate your significant other this movie is for you for the guys it will be a bag of laughs br br it's sad when former award winning actresses have to do cut rate movies br br the only really good part is the last 10 seconds even that was a load of cheese br br my wife is picking the worst movies lately this is what you get i for letting my wife pick movies based on reading reviews on movie rental sites,0
avoid the usa version it is with added us footage and the worst dubbing you've ever heard probably done by new york amateurs the dubbing is so bad that it sounds like mystery science theater 3000 i think a black guy from the bronx does chiba's voice i couldn't watch the entire film it was that bad instead of this americanized version watch chiba's other greats like the streetfighter or karate warriors,0
there are exactly 2 good things to be said about fantasies both mentioned by a previous reviewer as well br br a bo derek's extraordinary poetry inspiring beauty she has shots in this movie where she gives even catherine zeta jones a run for her money and that's a high compliment indeed her nudity is brief and discreet but just looking at her face is enough br br b the greek island setting with its sun and crystal clear blue waters br br other than that there is no story the dialogue is abysmal and at times unintentionally funny he touched you where you're a woman and peter hooten's character is a slimy jerk bo overplays the naivete of her character but then again when you have to work with dialogue this bad it's unfair to blame the actors the fact that she kept saying the name damir in almost every sentence is a major irritation oh and although the film is set on a greek island there is hardly a greek word to be heard apparently everyone there from kids to old people speaks english the whole time,0
i really wanted to like this film but the story is ridicules i don't want to spoil this film don't worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen but here's an example of how sloppy this film was put together the cowboy and twig ride up the ridge the cowboy has a handle bar mustache the cowboy and twig get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge the cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave in dark on the back of a horse br br to be fair the acting by the four main characters is solid,0
the only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery this movie was long and boring the minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed how many times can his boys take the lord's name in vain in this film being from a presbyterian background it doesn't fit i wished paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly smirkish selfish story of paul brad pitt so norm becomes a teacher and paul becomes a compulsive gambler who norm wants to rescue but doesn't so what it's very uninteresting we see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by paul because of his native american girl that was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real 'wild western' what we only see is a sleepy town where the two minister's sons have nothing to do but 1 norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2 paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies i'd rather watch a show about fishing that that film again which will be never,0
i rented this back in the 80's and honestly can't remember anything specific about the movie only that it is the worst movie i have ever seen this isn't one of those it was so bad it was funny this isn't one of those it was so gory it leaves you with a bad feeling movies it wasn't even one of those what the heck was that movies i can't recall the performance of the actors but it was poorly shot the story was disjointed and it had no definable style when it was over i was angry that i had wasted the time br br i've seen plenty of movies i didn't understand because of unfamiliar cultures styles and or story telling but it was clear that those movies had some of those properties the incubus has none br br i actually contemplated not making a comment on this piece for fear that someone may watch it out of curiosity but i am compelled to warn anyone who appreciates film to skip this movie,0
things to come is an early sci fi film that shows an imagined world or everytown through 100 years you can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts the film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the boss wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again after everytown was bombed and war broke out br br this film only has about 3 faults it's audio is muddy and video had some quirks the characters aren't deep at all and the overall plot isn't altogether solid the plot is lacking something that i can't put my finger on it just seems a little fluffy but if you love sci fi and are interested in what h g wells though might happened in the next hundred years this is a must see it's worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing a long drawn out war because they were just about to go to war with germany and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything br br things to come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once,1
this was one of the all time best episodes officer sean cooper was murdered in his patrol car back in '68 a dying convict in the state penitentiary reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after the shooting his case is reopened with the presumption that he was corrupted as a policeman br br further investigation into him as a police officer and a human being reveals a war veteran involved in a forbidden love this type of love was considered shameful and something to at least keep hidden at that time br br while this isn't the type of love i personally support he was still a policeman and a human being and shouldn't have been killed for it the sound track was excellent keeps me watching the dvr and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to emphasize one object or give a particular feeling to a scene was especially appealing i shall be watching this one in repeat,1
when i was young i had seen very few movies my parents in all their wisdom rented this one i was very wary of what the movie was about in fact i wasn't even allowed to watch it my brother and sister got to of course and this made me very angry so what did i do late at night i trashed the vcr kicked the screen of the tv in and called the police and reported vandals i was arrested of course i was unable to get my foot out of the tv set before the police arrived i was only given a stern talking to and sent home my parents grounded me of course and made me work to repay the debt for the tv and vcr this tore me apart slave labour really sucks believe me but i had to do it chores all around the house what happened in the end we got a big screen tv dvd player and a surround sound system for my work how did i get the money easy i made movies of my own and sold them to disney do you remember finding neno well i wrote that movie and filmed my goldfish in their fish tanks they rewrote the plot of course and did it in cgi because they couldn't afford to make it a real life action picture like i had done in the end i never saw the film the head that didn't die and the rating i gave it is my life rating it's doing pretty good,1
i'm going to spend as much time on this review as the writers did on the script this is easily the worst sequel ever made br br they killed navin johnson not only was mark blankfield's performance god awful so was everyone elses the physical comedy was forced flat and predictable the script seemed to have been written by mongoloid monkeys using the pen names ziggy steinberg and rocco urbisci how the producers managed to squeeze out such vile cinematic excrement is beyond me they even managed to make veteran actor ray walston look like a talent less buffoon director michael schultz should be ashamed of himself br br i want the 96 minutes of my life i spent watching this befouled memory of a brilliant comedy back so i can try and convict everyone involved for this cinematic atrocity,0
i do regret that i have bought this series i expected more action more objective picture and more consistency this is just a pure propaganda series very dark without any charm or romanticism it is just boredom itself i find the actors work quite weak as well o'donnell might seem charming as robin with batman but in this picture he lacks any charm probably while he becomes older he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up it comes as no surprise that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for 40 of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands,0
the finale of the weissmuller tarzan movies is a rather weak one there are a few things that derail this film br br first tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals in my opinion any footwear on tarzan whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed takes away from the character which is supposed to be anti civilization and pro jungle br br second the character of benji as mentioned in a previous post totally derails the movie as the comic foil to me his character is unnecessary to the film's plot br br also while weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as tarzan it's apparent that he was not in his best shape although in his later jungle jim movies his physique had improved somewhat from this film br br the octopus battle is a terrific idea but i think it should have been done in an earlier weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak likewise the battle which takes only 30 seconds tops would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in tarzan and his mate br br and while brenda joyce as jane and linda christian as mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye it doesn't manage to salvage this last weissmuller film a disappointing ending to a great character run,0
i disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the british the film effectively blames the people of ni as being the cause of their own troubles it suggests that the 25 year war was a question of intransigence and nothing to do with britain's partition of ireland and domination of its history i e ni was created by britain in 1921 irrespective of the wishes of the rest of ireland br br the characters are portrayed as hapless fools even though i despise loyalist paramilitaries they were fighting for a cause maintaining their artificial privileges over the catholic community it is a known fact that british intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war no doubt to keep the catholics at bay and demoralise republicanism br br nineties' values about 'machismo' masculinity etc are transposed on to 1970s belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique irish 'psyche' which leads to violence the stupid song from the woman in the club old ireland of green fields blah blah is given a symbolic stature i e poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause tedious ahistorical cheap and nasty trash o'sullivan has made a personal statement on a conflict which requires serious political analysis,0
cornel wilde and three dumbbells search for sunken treasure in the south atlantic br br the treasure hunters led by wilde fight a group of territorial sharks with cute little sneers on their hungry faces wilde and his merry men must find a way to take themselves off the menu so they can begin excavating an old spanish galleon filled with gold bullion br br after the crew engages in a small eternity of pushing shoving arguing and listening to wilde's annoying health tips 5 crazy convicts board the boat and complicate things now it is a battle of wits as to who gets the treasure and who gets to see what the inside of a shark's stomach looks like br br at least wilde is in shape wearing exactly the same thing he wore in 'the naked prey' 10 years earlier and he has remained in excellent condition br br made on a budget of 75 cents,0
i am not a usual commenter on this website but seeing how underrated this movie is i endeavour myself to write some comments and remarks about it i had fun watching this movie perhaps because cat is everything i wish i could be i am not going to post spoilers or reveal plots but there's are things that i really found amazing the way she manipulates people it's just so divine this is a very underrated movie i lack of arguments here i usually go enjoy and then speak little about it when you go to the movies is to have fun and i really enjoyed the 1h53 i stayed in the dark room a must seen over and over again until the delight fades away let's try not be so critical about it thank you for reading,1
a truly frightening film feels as if it were made in the early '90s by a straight person who wanted to show that gays are good normal mainstream aspiring people retrograde to the point of being offensive ltr suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred path to salvation for sad lonely sex crazed gays wow who knew the supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes the effeminate buffoon the bitter lonely queen the fag hag etc and the main characters are milquetoast middle class middlebrow clones of little interest br br as far as the romantic ideological struggles of the main couple are concerned there's not much to say we've seen it all before and done much better,0
while this movie won't go down in the annals of great cinema it is a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family the film is finally being released in video where it should have debuted in the first place br br the film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for dinners which they have named the hungry bachelors club jorja fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate in order to get a down payment for the restaurant that she wants to open bill nunn plays a cadillac loving mystery man who becomes her lover fox gives an understated and touching performance and nunn is reliably talented as always micheal des barres is a hoot as an over the top attorney the ensemble casts made up of familiar faces works nicely together to bring this wacky group of characters to life this is a good rental and one of the few you can watch with the whole family,1
i went into this movie perhaps a bit jaded by the hack and slash films rampant on the screen these days boy was i surprised this little treasure was pleasantly paced with a somber dark atmosphere more surprising yet was the very limited amount of blood actually shown as with most good movies this one leaves something to the imagination and bill paxton did a superb job at directing scenes shot inside the car as are well done and after watching the anatomy of a scene episode at the end of the video tape it was good to see that some of the subtle yet wonderful things i had noticed were intentional and not just an oh that looks good keep it type of direction this is a moody movie filled with grimness still for the dark subject a considerable portion of it is filmed in daylight even some of the more disturbing scenes the acting is exceptional okay i've always been a fan of powers booth and never goes over the top au contraire it is very subdued which works extremely well for this type of film if there is any one area where this film lacks it is in the ending which seems just a bit too contrived but still works on a simpler level without destroying the mood or the message of the movie what is the message it's something that each individual decides for themself overall on the 1 10 scale this movie scores an 8 for those who like the southern gothic genre ie body heat or midnight in the garden of good and evil and about a 5 for those who don't,1
the unborn is a very very different film james karen brooke adams are in the film and they performed quite well this film is builds up solidly and it keeps you going though i think you must be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot there is one brief sex scene with no nudity that could have been left out and to some people this scene may disappoint someone like me that's into the film and thinks that stuff ruins a good film but that's it when it comes to that there is a scene where adams' character goes nuts and kills a cat but you can tell its not real the music is very different but very good the unborn in my opinion is a really creepy film that's superbly unpredictable and that's quite strange i recommend all horror fans to this movie,1
i rented this film from netflix for two reasons i was in the mood for what i thought would be a silly '50s sci fi asco and because it is the first feature length superman film needless to say after about 15 minutes i found myself thoroughly engaged and very pleasantly surprised br br an experimental oil well has penetrated about six miles into the earth and is being shut down by the sponsor lois and clark show up to get the scoop but are disappointed that the deepest well ever drilled will no longer be in operation a day later strange events at the well make for a story more appropriate for superman than clark kent it seems that the radioactive mole men have invaded from their six mile deep home near the earth's core br br supermen and the mole men is a simplistic but well made piece of social realism released in 1951 starring a lead actor who served in world war ii the moral of the story seems to be that americans are just as capable of becoming fascists as anybody else to drive this point home in a typically straightforward superman manner reeves even accuses the lynch mob hunting the mole men of being 'nazis' at one point br br even in the 1950s the science underlying this film was nonexistent six miles of drilling through continental crust would not have even penetrated the upper mantle let alone the hollow center of the earth which in any case does not exist forgivable keep in mind that this film is based on a golden age comic book br br the film is a little unevenly paced although the molemen are interesting a bit creepy and nicely portrayed there are several corman esquire scenes which spend too much time redundantly showing us their odd behavior the script is intelligent and economical by today's standards the costuming is poor to fair but for its time this film's special effects and costuming were quite good the cinematography is also generally very good and the acting is much better than one might expect i was particularly impressed with reeves jeff corey and walter reed,1
after coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes though i guess not if the first one wasn't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch with all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever though they couldn't they had to take all the same raunchy not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again though the thing is i didn't laugh at it the first time they tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to watch it and enjoy it then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience well i fit into the age range that it's supposed to be funny for while people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not if you do find this funny then you probably aren't one of the more mature or intelligent people around it doesn't take that much skill to write that kind of a script though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie spaceballs it's a movie parody that's actually good and well done and it didn't have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either,0
as a kid my friends and i all believed that gymkata was the most violent bloody movie ever made i'm not sure who started that rumor it was probably born out of the frustration of 10 year olds who weren't allowed to see it for one reason or other years after gymkata was released it became a perennial late night cable movie and as a result i've been able to make up for lost time i must have seen scenes from this dreadful excuse for a film over a dozen times and i can always spot it from 1 2 seconds of screen time however aside from the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts the bad dubbing the stiff dialog and the outrageously difficult story line the film has some things going for it with all that's bad about the movie visually the sound is actually pretty entertaining never before has a punch or kick landed with so little force and so much volume the canned kung fu sounds are cheeky but the slowed and pitched down music and the nearly 5 minute slow motion scene are truly weird the chase through the city of demented blood thirsty villagers isn't really tense as much as it is irritating and there are enough bad wigs and extras who all but look into the camera and wave to make this train wreck a little fun could it be headed for cult classic status where is mst3k when we need it,0
this is a racist movie but worthy of study and enjoyment first time through it the natural inclination is to focus on erbe dad they have a relaxed peaceful thing going what with her still at home about to graduate from high school and him retired and kicking back waiting for inspiration to do something second time through you realize how horribly the sister's husband is dissed by her friends in the backwoods blues bar he takes it it's the thing to do these days and the critical moment passes as if they were chatting about the weather in that same scene the sister's blues song is a real tear jerker if you're the least bit sensitive and like that kind of music her performance feels like the climax of the story a blues story with the good guys being people of color in their element in backwoods sc meanwhile all the white folk in the movie lead what appears to be shallow meaningless lives fit only for making babies that's cool long as you recognize it as fiction,1
i heard this film was much more stylistic than the films director guy ritchie lock stock and two smoking barrels snatch had directed before the problem is it is possibly too stylistic basically jake green jason statham is released from prison after seven years in solitary and within two years he gambles loads of his money he is ready to seek revenge against the violence prone casino owner who got jake sent to prison dorothy 'mr d' macha ray liotta in the process doctors tell jake that he has three days left to live as he is dying from a rare blood disease oh and macha puts hit men on him loan sharks zach vincent pastore and avi andré benjamin are demanding jake pays their cash back and do some odd jobs for them the film is filled with jake narrating through some flashbacks and through his last three days before coming to the big revelation about zach and avi and macha well i assume that's what it was also starring terence maynard as french paul andrew howard as billy mark strong as sorter francesca annis as lily walker anjela lauren smith as doreen and elana binysh as rachel the are sequences involving a little bit of animation repeating lines twice in different perspectives and changing speeds for moments and all of these are irritating to the point of confusion and boredom making it a silly crime drama pretty poor,0
if you're going to put on a play within the prison walls why not go for the top playwright william shakespeare and if you are going to choose your cast from a whole lot of criminals serving long sentences for the most heinous crimes you can be sure there will be plenty of time for rehearsals in a kentucky correctional prison a courageous project such as this was undertaken with amazing results this film shows how it was all done the casting the rehearsals the set and costumesand the final presentation of shakespeare's play the tempest it had not occurred to me before but there is an analogy between the setting of the play and the correctional prison in the play the ship wrecked characters are confined to an island with no contact with the outside world prison life too is much like that br br with a simple painted back drop of a surrounding seascape the characters in a most pleasing assortment of costumes bellow out their lines to an approving audience may be not quite as shakespeare intended but with good heart and true sincerity for sure br br more interesting than the play itself were the little cameos of each man behind his character one inmate saw the play as a lesson in forgiveness another as a redemption of his sins it was quite moving to see the men wipe away a tear as they spoke of murder shooting and strangulation one had the feeling that they would all like to wind back the clock and reconsider their brutal actions however as someone said the past was past and the present was the beginning of a new future at least the play gave temporary relief from the depressing thoughts of past events br br the prison authorities should be applauded for allowing the play to take place such an event would put kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons might follow their good example it seems to me that everyone stands to benefitnot only the kentucky prison but the prisoners themselves who need to find new confidence and self esteem and be prepared for the day when they go out on parole,1
i've seen hundreds of silent movies some will always be classics such as nosferatu metropolis the general and wings but among them my favorite is this film it may not be the best but a favorite yes in fact when i looked it up on imdb i noticed i immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so gosh darn cute and well made marion davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not just william randolph hearst's mistress br br the story involves a hick from georgia coming to hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a must see,1
i watched this movie for its two hours and have absolutely no idea what it's about somebody got murdered or maybe they didn't and maybe somebody did it or maybe they didn't this brought back memories of the good old days bad old days when all cbc canadian movies were stinkers lately stinkers have been the exception but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism mind reeling flash backs and mumbled dialogue makes up for lost time i've never found margaret atwood's books easy to read this movie continues that fine canadian tradition it isn't easy to watch maybe the trendy folks at the chi chi toronto cocktail parties will pretend they liked it us folks in the boonies are a little less pretentious,0
as a lapsed catholic who had 11 years of catholic school but hasn't been to mass in 35 years except for weddings and funerals i thought i'd get a kick out of this and i did for the first two thirds of the movie it was all the standard stuff strict parochial school teachings repressed sexuality etc but then suddenly the movie turned mean really mean now mind you i saw this before the pedophilia scandals hit and maybe i wouldn't have been quite so offended at such nasty hateful digs at the catholic church if i'd known about those abominations such a catholic term and coverups br br it's been a few years since i rented the video and i won't go back to rent it again with a new perspective it just left such a dirty nasty ugly taste in my mouth i wonder what experience all the actors had with the church because either they really hate it or they whored themselves for the paycheck it's an incredibly anti catholic movie offensive to anyone who has a glimmer of a gleam of respect for catholic education which i still do because there were no better teachers back in the '50s whatever else those nuns did they forced me to learn how to read and write the english language they made us memorize how many kids today can do simple arithmetic in their heads truth is there's nothing more essential for success in america can ya read can ya add subtract multiply divide great you can get any advanced degree you want and the discipline of catholic education will stand you in good stead not just as you continue your studies but also for the rest of your life no matter what you think of the catholic mythology we all had to learn br br such a great cast such a lousy rotten script i really feel bad and no it's not badly trust me the nuns taught me better for the writer and director br br i thought i had mixed emotions about catholic school but the participants in this project must've been those bad ie e stupid kids who sat in the back of the room if they were willingly involved in making this movie,0
paul grace hartman are my husbands grandparents they were both deceased when we met so watching old movies is a good way to see them and their work i have always enjoyed old movies and was very happy to discover that this was also a very good one,1
francesca annis michael kitchen and robson green wow what a trio ok so this is no anna karenina but it is a good love story very well written and well acted by all even a few 'laugh out loud' moments mixed in with some pretty serious observations on fidelity age bias and parental aging alzheimer's issues br br quirky guitar music added to the story as well br br while i have been a fan of ms annis' since 'lillie' in the '70s and mr kitchen's since 'the buccaneers' and 'enchanted april' i have only recently discovered mr green 'me and mrs jones' 'touching evil' etc making me ask the question why had i not seen 'reckless' until recently admittedly more of a 'chick flick' than something a man will sit through it is perfect for a rainy afternoon's lazy viewing,1
note to previous reviewer this movie is science fiction adaptation of the iliad according to the screenwriter so whether the references are painful or not no apologies it is the basis for the film they admit they stole though adapted is the p c term br br great flick but too short probably didn't come out as well as the author director or studio wanted but pretty damn fun the fact that the studio itself imploded during the making only helps add to its legacy br br a big budget remake wouldn't be as fun and probably wouldn't do the screenplay any more justice but it's fun to dream about the potential there a dvd release with some meager extras is apparently available but i don't think it would play on ntsc players i'm no expert and thus still trying to figure this out for now i live with the vhs incarnation,1
i've watched this movie twice now on dvd and both times it didn't fail to impress me with its unique impartial attitude it seems more like a depiction of reality than most other hollywood fare especially on a topic that is still hotly discussed even though it sticks closely with the southern viewpoint it doesn't fail to question it and in the end the only sentence passed is that the war is lost not matter what and cruelty is a common denominator br br what really makes this movie outstanding is the refusal to over dramatize nowadays truly good movies in a nutshell are few and far apart with mainstream fare being enjoyable if you don't have high expectations but terribly commercially spirited i think this movie comes off as a truly good movie without being a masterpiece because it sticks to itself and gives the viewer a chance to watch and analyze it instead of wanting to bombard him with effect and emotion to blot out his intelligence this movie is cool observant and generally light handed in its judgement which is good br br the story has its flaws especially jewel's character comes off doubtfully but then again the situation at the time was so chaotic that for a young widow it might have been only logical to somehow get back into a normal life even by liberally taking each next guy still she doesn't come off as weak in fact i think she's one of the stronger characters she's always in control of the relationships with the men just tagging and i take it very gratefully that she's not a weeping widow i believe in the 19th century death of a loved one was something a lot more normal than now you could die so easily of even minor illnesses and injuries so the prospect of of someone dying while surely causing grief didn't traumatise people like it does now people didn't seem to build shrines about their lost ones like they do now and i like that attitude br br my recommendation is for intelligent people to watch this movie if they are in the mood for something different than the usual hollywood fare don't watch if if you want non stop action or heart renting emotion,1
an ultra nervous old man mr goodrich terrorized by the news that a gang is stalking the city and prominent citizens are disappearing really panics when someone throws a rock through his window with a message tied to it saying you will be next br br he calls the detective agency wondering where are the guys he asked for earlier of course it's the stooges who couldn't respond because had come into the office robbed them and tied them up some detectives the moment poor mr goodrich hangs up the phone and says i feel safer already a monster type goon named nico appears out of a secret panel in the room and chokes him unconscious we next find out that his trusted employees are anything but that now these crooks have to deal with the detectives that are coming by the house for mr goodrich br br some of the gags like moe and larry's wrinkles are getting a bit old but some of them will provoke laughs if i see them 100 times i always laugh at shemp trying to be a flirt as he does here with mr goodrich's niece in a classic routine with a long accordion like camera lens the act he puts on when he's poisoned is always funny too shemp was so good that i didn't mind he was taking the great curly's place br br larry moe curly shemp were always great in the chase scenes in which monsters or crooks or both are chasing them around a house that's the last six minutes in here at times such as this film,1
i probably saw this movie first in about 1995 since then i've returned to it many times it's great i especially like the first and second clips creation and civilization rising wow this was so cool back in the glory days of cg animation cg is way older than i am as i know the film tron was made 7 years before my time but this film was a landmark in the early '90s it was probably the first collaboration of different cg experiments set to music i like it so much i think i'll go watch it now bye,1
i don't know much about tobe hooper or why he gets his name in the title but maybe he shouldn't have bothered as another commenter mentioned there isn't really enough horror or erotica to bring in fans of either genre the plot is incoherent the sade sequences are gratuitous and most of the acting is so so englund was doing his best with weak material and zoe trilling has a really great bottom but neither is enough to carry this film this one's a tape over grade f,0
not wishing to give anything away here i would just say this technically excellent flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half's entertainment it will amuse surprise possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time as it approaches the inevitable but not obvious ending without becoming clichéd or predictable in any way most definitely recommended br br a previous user's comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both branagh and bonham carter's outstanding performances i agree entirely,1

what's written on the poster is at birth he was given 6 years to live at 34 he takes the journey of a lifetime ami is an american born israeli who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy disease at the age of one at age of 34 after the love toward his 22 years old care giver didn't go well he decided to come to the us to face the doctor who said that he would have only 6 years to live he wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive and weights 39 pounds why your guess is as good as mine even i have seen this film br br obviously it's courageous to live when all he can move is his left index finger but why does he have so much anger toward the doctor who diagnosed his disease 34 years ago his doctor just told his mom that based on the medical history people with his disease won't live long what's the point of him showing up at old doctor's door for why is tracking down this old doctor in the us is a journey of his lifetime there are so many things we might be interested in ami's life how can he make those animations with the movement of only one finger how can he go through daily lives while totally depending on others how did he out lived his doctor's prediction how does he deal emotionally when other people look at him like looking at a strange creature the movie told us none of that instead the filmmaker got a van and set up a trip to let ami to show up at his old doctor's door in order to show him that he is still alive i thought it was a joke,0
every great gangster movie has under currents of human drama don't expect an emotional story of guilt retribution and despair from scarface this is a tale of ferocious greed corruption and power the darker side of the fabled american dream br br anybody complaining about the cheesiness of this film is missing the point the superficial characters cheesy music and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess nothing in the lives of these characters really matter not on any human level at least in fact the film practically borderlines satire ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of tony montana br br this isn't brian depalma's strongest directorial effort it is occasionally excellent and well handled particularly the memorable finale but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled thankfully it is supported by a very strong script by oliver stone probably good therapy for him considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time the themes are consistent with the focus primarily on the life of tony montana and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power the dialogue is also excellent see sawing comfortably between humour and drama there are many stand out lines which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another br br the cast help make it what it is as well but this is really pacino's film one of his earlier less subtle performances something much more common from him nowadays this is a world entirely separate from michael corleone and frank serpico yet he is as watchable here as ever in very entertaining and intentionally over the top form it is hard to imagine another tony montana after seeing this film in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing but i've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife not an exceptional effort but unfairly misjudged the supporting players are very good too particularly paul shenar as the suave alejandro sosa br br powerful occasionally humorous sometimes shocking and continually controversial scarface is one of the films of the eighties whatever that might mean to you an essential and accessible gangster flick and a pop culture landmark 9 10,1
the most succinct way to describe ride with the devil is with but one word authenticity i will not rehash what has already been said about this wonderous film but i would like to say how much the historical research and painstaking attention to detail the crew no doubt went through was appreciated by this filmgoer br br as a student of history familiar with the period and setting of this film i must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films regarding bleeding kansas yes there were liberties taken on the actual events as all fiction is apt to do but the overall feel of the film is genuine authentic costumes authentic attitudes no pc hindsight here even the actors look authentic even jewel kilcher who has a small part in the film looked like she stepped form a mid 19th century photograph br br a few viewers i talked with have expressed their incredulity at the stylized dialog they cannot believe that 19th century farmers would talk like poets br br what they don't realize is that in this age of verbal slobbishness the american public public of the 19th century was a surprisingly literate and eloquent bunch these people were raised on shakespeare and the king james version of the bible the screenwriters reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people judging from documentation of the time the stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the film br br but in addition to a historical document this film works on a visceral level as well beautifully photographed and performed it harkens back to the days of the great western epics the raid on lawrence kansas done so many times before in so many other lesser films is portrayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the midst of the action br br romance adventure moral and ethical conflict this film has everything a discerning moviegoer could want br br in a year that was dominated by overhyped garbage like american beauty this great artwork was buried by an indifferent studio system but i am certain that ride with the devil will be given it's due in the coming years please rent this film you will not be disappointed,1
while the british produced some hilarious and slick sitcoms in the 1990s ab fab men behaving badly one foot in the grave etc the 70s were the real golden age br br in the 1970s there were whole new territories to explore including the sexual revolution feminism and the slowly evolving awareness of a need for sensitivity that would twenty years later become political correctness attempts to grapple with the confusion of this thoroughly modern world were the subtle and not so subtle themes in everything from the skits of monty python's flying circus to sitcoms like man about the house by the late 70s this grappling resulted in more meditative and bitter sweet sitcoms such as the masterpiece butterflies br br man about the house is a perfect example of the good britcoms of the time slightly genteel cheeky fresh ingenuous sometimes outrageous with some well made observations on contemporary life compare it to a cynical 90s show such as ab fab and it is hard to believe the two were created in the same country br br man about the house is one of the great britcoms of the 70s right up there with good neighbors the good life and about the house's spin off george and mildred its quality is attested to by the fact that as with good neighbors its creators writers and many of its cast have had continued success in british television,1
it felt like i watched this movie thousand times before it was absolutely predictable every time the story tried to get a bit twisted every time i awaited something interesting to happen i saw nothing but what i expected like the bread factory opened up another facility because there was not enough bread in two words flat story that has become a cliché bad acting bad special effects only the dumb russian cop vlad was a bit funny while punishing around the bad guys the pile of muscles was so incredibly stupid that it made me laugh at him for a moment i wonder why i waste my time spitting on that shame of a movie it won't get worse because it is not possible d,0
i'm really suprised this movie didn't get a higher rating on imdb it's one of those movies that could easily get by someone but for romantic comedy moonstruck is really in a class by itself it's setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted the casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie few movies in the 1980's were as good as moonstruck and it's funny too out of,1
partially from the perceived need one feels to include a conventional love story in the plot to make the film more marketable to a 1950's movie going public br br the film starts with some wickedly funny characterizations of the upper class bureaucrats running the foreign office the british are pilloried in the way that only the british can pillory themselves but after that the film loses its way in a conventional farcical plot terry thomas watchable as always but the great talent in the cast peter sellers et al is largely wasted br br a diverting but not great film,1
this unpretentious horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic much much better than 90 of the scream rip offs out there i even hope they come up with a sequel,1
this is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just have to get because it just looks so horribly bad and indeed we couldn't take most of it there was a lot of fast forwarding going on br br but then we came across a scene where robert englund seduces the female protagonist her name somehow slips my mind at this time cripes i've never watched a single scene from a film so many times i'm estimating forty or so and i've never laughed so hard in my life you see englund has this thing for showing off his loins i last saw the film a couple months ago but i can't stop laughing as i type anyway the scene is a montage of shots englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl englund riding a horse naked and some mysterious woman fellating a snake's head this is absolute genius you've got to see it for yourself,0
i'd like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest crappiest movie i've ever seen br br i have no idea what's wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings the only thing i can imagine is that people must've voted during one or more conditions br br 1 while being shitfaced stoned out of their minds 2 they've received hard cash for the votes 3 under gunpoint br br i can't believe i wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie,0
as hard as it is for me to believe with all of the awful reality shows out there over the past few years this one has to take over the top spot for worst one yet i am still wondering if this was actually just a spoof done by the sctv gang if andy kaufmann were still alive i'd be sure he was behind this can a rock band stoop any lower than has inxs to do such a shameful thing as this the premise is simple and moronic audition a bunch of karaoke rejects to become the new lead singer of inxs to take the place of michael hutchence who committed suicide in 1997 eight years and no hits later the band commit the ultimate act of patheticness by subjecting themselves to auditioning a bunch of talentless wannabes to be the new lead singer of a band that is 20 years past its prime so they trot all of these awful singers i thought american idol had its share of doozies who do atrocious renditions of just about every classic and predictable rock song imaginable and then they cut to the inxs band members who are seriously discussing the merits of each of these candidates you could see better and more original rock performers at just about any night club in any city in the world br br it has all the usual uncreative elements of every other reality show lame reality participants lame interviews lame host emcee lame judging of performances and the lame booting of one participant at the end of each show can these shows get any more predictable it's clearly a publicity stunt on the part of the band a last gasp of hope at rekindling their lost stardom before they are finally buried into oblivion michael hutchence if he had any shred of dignity when alive has to be rolling over in his grave not that inxs were ever a great band but i had no idea they were this pathetic if inxs are at all representative of what rock and roll has become this show would be the final proof that rock and roll is once and for all dead,0
highly recommended br br a well written funny film which will appeal to everyone out there with a sense of humour give it a go it's good to see an independent british movie more than holding it's own against the big established studios definitely worth adding to any film collection there are scenes in this film that i'm sure a lot of people will be able to relate to you will laugh out loud at the antics and enjoy the great soundtrack i especially enjoyed the orb's version of jimmy cliff's vietnam and the tower of london's take on freebird br br go on give it a go you won't be disappointed,1
this belgian film directed by tom barman singer of the well known group deus will not be favoured by everyone for the simple reason that there isn't a clear story or even a plot this movie just shows 24 hours in a city here antwerp and allows you to watch and truly enjoy the dialogues the directing the humorous dario the osteopath bruno and tragic windman paul garcin characters br br there are several memorable scenes the windman on the beach the dance party at the end the kiss fan windman visits the osteopath br br clearly some other viewers didn't understand what's so beautiful and interesting in this movie they complain that this movie has no story etc but it's the atmosphere that keeps you watching and that will drag you into it br br if you didn't watch it yet be sure to listen carefully to the music the soundtrack is extraordinary just like tom barman and his group deus br br and ssst mondje dicht hé don't tell anyone,1
what a crappy movie the worst of the worst this movie is as entertaining as a dead slug no talent what so ever actors stupid plot who wrote this script was there ever a script for this goofy movie or did the director just accidentally press the record button on his camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what my friends younger brother is in the 6 th grade and him and his classmates just did an amateur movie for their school project which outdid this geeky movie this is by far the worst film i have seen in my life there is just no excuse for this flick,0
originally aired as an abc movie of the week this involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little southern town they aren't allowed phone calls and nobody knows they're there what follows is rape torture beatings humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion br br the tv version was for its time grim no nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down the unrated version is even worse there's plentiful nudity the violence is extreme and in one particularly disgusting sequence we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard uses her yuck there's nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink you get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degraded all this is shoved in your face like you're supposed to enjoy it the needlessly downbeat ending doesn't help br br i'm giving it a 3 because the acting is good but that actually makes the movie harder to watch a sick sleazy film not recommended,0
an old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat he wanders the woods to witness a murder but did he see the murder or is he losing his mind is he just getting old the movie so great because the viewer has to make up their own mind on what is going on there is very little dialog in this movie but it doesn't need words the whole movie speaks for itself you knew what was going on and i liked it br br the other part that i liked were the shots of the woods in late fall and winter those were pretty but the only thing i didn't like was the view of the old man in his underwear he could have tied the robe a little tighter but other than that it was a pretty deep movie,1
if you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood let it be boy but prepare yourself by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio br br after having watched such a good movie as arisan 2003 it is terrible to see what they come up with again in indonesia it seems that the only idea is to make money but no one seems seriously to work on the image of indonesia in the world of entertainment that it is a 'global' world doesn't seem to come up in the minds of those who make movies in indonesia and since the indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them as 'made in indonesia' with a flavor of the west they get away with it br br ok the story is nice to begin with and it could have developed into a nice flick but did the director never think about the fact that a musical needs first of all live music or at least good playback and secondly good choreography in this movie the playback is so bad that it makes you wanna cry right there in the cinema every single word you hear is followed seconds later by the actor or whoever sing playback and it is extremely annoying while watching the movie br br the choreography is as if they planned to make a movie about morning gymnastics but in the end thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical they only forgot to change the choreography it is hardly dancing you see they jump here and there throw their legs up in the air and that is about it br br well at least there's a happy ending but if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic do so,0
this was an atrocious waste of my time no plot the acting was so far below par it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what not to do it is merely a commercial rip off of the earlier universal soldier which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel its sad that vd needs to assert his ego every few years and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it this kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name by comparison it makes segall norris and arnold look almost talented br br perhaps vd should take the leslie nielson track and do send ups of his genre at least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him,0
although i like kurt vonnegut i'm not particularly interested in spy stories and i didn't know this one the only reason i watched it was nick nolte who is one of my favorite actors since i saw breakfast of champions and hotel rwanda but the film brought me a pleasant surprise of course nolte was great but so was the plot there was relatively little political intrigue and much more focus on the moral question by reading his anti semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to americans he in fact contributed to the general attitude of germans and as it later turns out americans towards jews or hitler which carries more weight his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti semitism the dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken not even as narration howard campbell jr nolte is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up not even in his memoirs the inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray but with the help of excellent acting and photography this film manages br br there are other points to it such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichés like the song white christmas that make it real different from average american movies i recommend it to everyone who is bored with hollywood spy movies,1
why watch this there is only one reason and that is for the greatness of john saxon i love his acting my most favorite appearances by him are in nightmare on elm street 1 3 and 7 as nancy's father a cop black christmas as a cop and from dusk till dawn again as a cop when i was rummaging through my local mall video outlet i came across the film zombie death house and i quickly tossed it back but before moving on i noticed that john saxon was not only an actor in this film but for the first time that i have ever heard of a director this intrigued me also the cheap 9 00 price tag and i and i had to have it upon coming home i realized that this film did not live up to saxon's other work even his acting which may have been muddled by the added pressures of directing but it was not just him the other actors sucked too it seemed as if they had all been pulled out of a recent porno shoot and told now guys you really have to act the film even looks of 80's porn quality i cannot in good faith recommend this film to casual viewers but if you are an obsessed fan of the 80's who missed out on the culture that came from that era by being born to late or a fan of crap films than this one is for also if you dig john saxon as i do,0
when i sat down to watch 'largo winch' i expected nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars when i stood up i've seen both of these and more br br karl roden was finally not the antagonist in a movie to start with kristin scott thomas played her role well but the real two stars in my opinion were tomer sisley and miki manojlovic both acting superbly in radivoje bukvic portrayed goran well br br the mixed linguistics brought a nice color to the movie but i understand why people would get bored with it br br the scenery of hong kong and especially the stunning croatian seaside both amazed me and i hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen when largo entered the unbelievably beautiful island br br rolls royce phantom mercedes s500 and bmw 7 if anyone loves expensive limousine type cars this is their movie it is also a movie for people who love action sequences good acting landscapes of extremal beauty and above all a fast paced well written action movie with dazzling combat and a thoroughly twined inner drama br br my vote as it has enlightened a gloomy day is 10 10,1
zane and beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats i don't typically go for military war movies but this was worth my time br br it was serious but it was also humorous beringer's character proved to be heroic and honest no matter what you know that he's got your back br br zane's character developed throughout the film he wasn't just a suit he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun br br the ending through me a little though it didn't really go with the action throughout the film but i'm glad that i saw it nonetheless br br it's worth checking out,1
this is a great ending to the show the fact that adm janeway was able to do a double switch on the borg was great the fact that she allowed herself to be infected thus infecting the queen with a poison that in essence ended the borg was great the way they ended it also left some not a lot for a reunion movie however they did bring them home and the way they did it was fantastic it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family ending it with tom and b'lanna having their baby just as they enter the alpha quad was a great way to show a new beginning it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type just to see where their characters would be today,1
the only thing serious about this movie is the humor well worth the rental price i'll bet you watch it twice it's obvious that sutherland enjoyed his role,1
this is a great film br br i agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this i had never heard of it or anyone in it excpet mike from friends br br but it is great eva lake and paul give amazing performances the humour is consistently dry and witty br br paul rudd pretty much plays the mike character from friends which works great the other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic i mean we are not talking 'apocalypse now' here but the characters are likable the story is engaging the soundtrack production and direction all work well br br in all a great feel good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets br br everyone has their own tastes but i really don't understand the one star reviews for this,1
without question the worst elvis film ever made the movie portrays all indians as drunk stupid and lazy watch elvis's skin change color throughout the film,0
wow finally jim carrey has returned from the died this movie had me laughing and crying it also sends a message that we should all know and learn from jeniffer aniston was great she will finally have a hit movie under her belt if you liked liar liar you will love this movie i give it 9 10,1
the final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films it goes further to play the anti bond theme bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography stunt work to the script to acting br br the film starts out in a flurry as bourne is running from the moscow police the story seems to pick up right where the first film left off or does it the time is a little muddled here but we get the fact that bourne is remembering things a sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone they aren't his target from there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player noah vosen who seems to know everything about bourne and will protect it at all costs pamela landy is back as well as nicky parsons who seems to have a past with bourne as well br br the cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything the car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two and the veteran cast chasing bourne is superb with a nice part by albert finney it also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot all in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year if not the best action trilogy ever,1
there is no suspense in this serial when one episode ends the acting is so shoddy the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how batman and robin will save the day no in fact the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode this show is so boring that i can't see how it ever got made let alone released on dvd obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary batman films but even the script is awful an incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that i am not quite sure because it is too awful to follow watch the 60s version or the 90's versions or even batman begins just anything over this version,0
im watching it now on pink serbia tv station and i must say this is a crap shallow no acting effects too sloppy i mean who made this series br br this was a stupid attempt of the studios to make some more money on the success of the film ok the film was great in 1994 when it came out but the series br br some times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters i mean did they actually pay someone to write that was that someones relative at the studio this is no scifi br br the film was the bomb the series suck,0
half the reviews were good so i took a chance for 10 sure priscilla barnes had some sex talk but it wasn't much the whole plot later that she may be the other actress mother the documentary maker falling for the young woman is stretching it its not funny its not that raunchy its not much of anything but a waste of time boogie nights was based on real people that were in the adult industry this is based on nothing that ever happened in the industry it could have shocked with whats popular today in adult films mocking todays gonzo videos and that big orgy that they had 5 minutes to shoot what a joke a bigger orgy has been done bigger better decades ago in the early 1970s,0

i must say that i am fairly disappointed by this horror movie i did not get scared even once while watching it it also is not very suspenseful either i was able to guess the ending half way through the movie so what's left br br the ring is a trully scary movie i wish other movies would stop copying from it e g the trade mark long hair please give me some originality br br will not recommend this movie,0
the screenwriter poorly attempted to re create the exorcist' but put in some blah blah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged there is no substance whatsoever in this entire film it had the potential of being something special but blows it by showing a bunch of people yack about things nobody cares about extremely boring i wanted to leave the theater when i saw this but the dumb movie tickets were expensive so i had to withstand the dreary torture which felt like it lasted forever nothing on screen connected relevance back to whatever the characters were talking about br br they use computer graphics in here that instead of wowing me as it intended i hate cgi just ruined the movie even more some people say this movie did horrible in the movie theaters because of how thought provoking and slow paced without action because it's an intelligent film it was what is so intelligent or thought provoking when the story is basically about pretty boy heath ledger as a priest who has a love interest and disobeys his religion seems like an uninspired concept oh and there's some mumbo jumbo about the sin eater movie was originally going to be titled sin eater lame concept but the movie took the sin eater thing too seriously making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent it was yeah i know there were really sin eaters in the medieval times but this movie just makes it sound cheesy br br nothing in the movie was executed right and i forget why i even bothered to see this movie if you want horror films that actually have depth watch rosemary's baby the tenant naked blood society cannibal holocaust pin exorcist omen or any of the romero dead trilogy films nonsense dialogue does not equate to intelligence people mainstream movie fans think that though same kind of people that think a ridiculous movie like hulk is a cinematic masterpiece if you want mind numbingly boring horror watch the order this movie makes church seem like a roller coaster ride,0
this was stupid funny movie cheech and chong are the dopiest wasted guys ever i rate this film a 7 but if you like this one then go see jay and silentbob there funnier and crazier now cheech is a sellout working on kids movies wheres chong,1
considering that i felt like picking up a new jet li film to see some but kicking and brainless hand to hand fighting i grabbed this title br br unfortunatly this movie contains more gun battles ala chow yun fat but nowhere near as good than jet li and company's acrobatic fighting thus it was a let down br br the faucet fighting was interesting and even funny considering this was something totaly unexpected in a jet li film for me more on the line of say jackie chan br br but alas i'd recommend fist of legend tai chi master or even the enforcer over this dissapointment br br rating 4 for martial arts rating 3 for overall movie score,0
i should have known i was in trouble with casper van diem as the lead character words cannot describe nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was but please allow me to try to describe it horrible acting terrible dialog corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force fed the beliefs and propeganda from the trinity broadcasting network its a weak attempt at trying to show hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep religious message attached to it they failed miserably it was clearly the worst movie i have seen in a long time,0
what was the point of this movie what was the plot i do not know shaq can't act people don't know how to direct and i am kazaam a genie who raps come on maybe eminem or linkin park will be in a movie like this i remember i watched this just to kill time it didn't really interest me i just remember thinking who put shaq in this movie the whole story seemed stupid too it made no sense whatsoever i guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen i can't comment much more because this movie is so terrible there's nothing worth commenting about i wish this movie would go away,0
i was very disappointed in this movie plotwise it was weak bordering on silly souls who can affect reality in the way they do a mission apparently critical to the soul hunters entrusted to one of their younger members and the whole b story with the holobrothel and the lawsuit against the station was so awful that at one point i blurted out to the television why are you wasting my time with this br br thematically river of souls didn't really go into the question of the soul in any more depth than the original episode soul hunter did we see that soul hunters can make mistakes but we still don't get a feeling for their culture are there any female soul hunters br br the acting was okay given the material they had to work with and the special effects especially the planetscapes in the first act were very impressive but overall i'd say give this one a miss,0
scarecrows seems to be a botched horror meets supernatural film a group of thugs pull off a paramilitary like robbery of the payroll at camp pendleton in california they high jack a cargo plane kidnapping the pilot and his daughter with demands to be flown to mexico along the way one greedy robber decides to bailout with the money landing in a cornfield monitored by strange looking scarecrows these aren't just any run of the mill scarecrows they can kill the acting is no better than the horrible dialog and the attempts at humor are not funny very low budget and shot entirely in the dark br br the cast includes ted vernon michael david simms kristina sanborn b j turner phil zenderland and victoria christian,0
so we compromised this was a fairly charming film i liked the art direction it felt far more real than most kids movies and the costumes weren't too cutesy the child actors were not bad to watch the adult performances trended toward cheesy it was great that they showed how a bullied kid bullies others as well as kids standing up to bullying br br i don't know how many grown ups would want to see this for themselves but it's a great film to take a kid to and since barnyard was apparently attended by 100 kids at the same time i'm really glad we picked the sparsely attended showing of worms instead,1
once again i was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for 4 88 fifty percent of the time the movies i find in the bin are pure crap i mean horrible beyond belief but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good this movie is much better than i expected i found it very engaging though it was obviously made by an amateur br br the direction is nothing special but the story is intriguing with some good thrills i expected it to be more of a comedy but i wasn't too disappointed br br for a thriller this movie is surprisingly good natured there's no bloody violence no profanity no nudity no sex usually these movies require all four of those elements the pg rating is well deserved not like sixteen candles where the f word is used twice and there's a brief gratuitous nude scene br br i just wish the romance between corey haim and his love interest could've been developed more the film does tend to be plot heavy and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them we end up watching a careless three minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors they end up kissing at the end but there's so little chemistry that it seems forced br br the dream machine is no gem but it's good clean entertainment it's quite forgettable especially with a cast of unknowns except for haim but it's also much better than you'd expect br br my score 7 out of 10,1
one of the best low budget movies from germany is this is the dark side of new age if you believe in esoteric please don't watch this movie it blows all your positive fantasies away this movie shows that beyond the peaceful façade of spiritual soul searching lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror i hope there will be a 35 mm copy soon andreas marschall's first film is just the beginning of a new area making movies with a few euros i'm waiting for the second hit,1
quite typical for swedish movies of this type strange that the acting was soooo bad these actors usually give a good show the casting was poorly done it made you expect something i won't tell you what the lead character was awful i don't know where they find her anyway stay away from this and go see den tredje vågen instead this is swedish action in is prime,0
i really wanted to like this movie it has a nice prison setting conspiracy theories bloodthirsty zombies a perfectly hideous 80s touch and it is a directorial effort by actor john saxon who also plays a bad you guessed it a bad guy it reminds me of some beloved italian horror flicks but the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish frightening moment in there it just goes on and on and on and then it logically has to end more suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed,0
i cannot believe that they managed to spend us 17million on this film spectacularly bad acting egregious scripting and effects that you could do on your average pc unbelievable plot contrivances a reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess a major job at the un what not only that but the message of this film is so unsubtle that you come out feeling as if they've tried to batter you over the head with a full size crucifix all this movie will do will preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money if the makers of this film really wanted to sway people to christianity and show what it means to truly believe they would have used the money to help people truly in need now that might have swayed some people into actually listening to them,0
hidden frontier is notable for being the longest running internet based star trek fan series while the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like starship exeter or new voyages hidden frontier concentrates largely on story and in that regard it does very well indeed br br hidden frontier has no physical sets instead actors are filmed against a greenscreen and the backgrounds inserted digitally one of hidden frontier's greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced one of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming instead of in post production while this does save a great deal of time it's also worth noting that the quality of the resultant footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post production though it still serves its purpose br br while it may not be everyone's cup of tea hidden frontier is well worth a shot though you might be best to start off watching the third season since this is where the producers really start to hit their stride,1
this film exceeded my expectations i thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish so i wasn't expecting much however i was pleasantly surprised at first i didn't take well to the lead girl and didn't really care if she lived or died after a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character it's not just some slasher film where people die for no reason there is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film but explains a lot i would recommend this film to everyone if you're not sure just watch it anyway it's only an hour and a half of your life you're going to live for 80 years anyway,1
i don't know what it is with this movies but movies about history or religion are always criticised by their accuracy of course it's not 100 accurate it's difficult to make 100 accurate films nowadays when even the experts disagree with each other therefore i rather like to judge a movie by what it is trying to say than pick on all the inaccuracies br br so i start by saying that i liked this mini serie but i do agree with the critique that his childhood years went by too fast the series should have been a three part story his childhood being the first part but if they didn't have more money to shoot more story who am i to criticise that br br there's only one real problem i have with this movie and that's the fact that it's told in a history book way especially the second part which is just a sum of events that happened i rather would have liked to see hitler more humane more scenes where he doubts himself etc noah taylor did that more in the movie 'max' which seem to work better i think nevertheless i'm glad this was made and own it on dvd just to remember more vividly what happened and see carlyle giving his best 7 5 10,1
visually cluttered plot less incredibly mind numbing rubbish not even close to greenaway's better work avoid at all costs br br the overlapping 'split screen' effects do nothing more than confuse the film is very dark for a lot of the time and the 'artistic' composing of images is pretentious in the extreme br br there is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film even the nudity is incredibly unerotic which seeing it fills a large part of the film soon gets very boring br br plus how anyone can say that the acting of ewen macgregor is brilliant is beyond me he showed more ability in the star wars series and that's saying something br br i've not been so unimpressed with a film since i saw 'darby o'gill and the little people',0
there are no spoilers here because there is no plot to spoil madchen amick is living proof a face can make a living acting no talent required the only bright spot are a few really good one liners delivered very nicely by alice krige but then again she is alice krige her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be she is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot how they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery the screenplay writers must have been medicated when they submitted this script it has major continuity problems superficial stereotypical characters horror formula writing and simply falls short of making any sense what so ever the creatures while they have neat skills like going dim the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored br br don't waste any time on this one,0
first time of seeing buster keaton's first feature film and i have to admit i liked it a lot and only wish i'd stumbled across it years ago the rohauer blurb at the start warns that the three ages single nitrate print was rediscovered and salvaged in 1954 just in time before combustion and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated so it's rocky viewing in places but i've seen and survived much worse br br it would have been ok as the 3 short films but as a take on intolerance it's inventive and funny from the start to the finish in the stone age with baddie wallace beery riding an elephant and goodie buster riding a pet brontosaurus in the roman age buster riding a chariot with wheel locks and adapted for sledging no parking signs in latin in this technological age of speed need and greed his car beautifully falls to bits at the first hump both him and beery are after the girl through the ages a never ending tussle favourite bit as the caveman he gets knocked backward over a cliff edge but still blows a kiss to the camera an amazing second or two br br great stuff reaffirming my love of silent film comedy,1
in a poor village in mexico the colonel fernando luján lives with his asthmatic wife lola marisa paredes in an old house lola still grieves the death of their son augustin some time ago the colonel has been expecting for his pension of fighter in a war against catholic church for almost twenty seven years however for political reasons the present government wants to forget this old fight without having any possession or money but a valuable gamecock they struggle to survival with the expectation of the acknowledgement letter from the government recognizing the law and paying for the delayed pension this slow and touching movie reflects the social and financial situation of most of the elder retired persons in third world countries in brazil most of the retired persons has to survive with about us 80 00 per month the debts of the colonel in the story were made to pay for a graveyard for his son otherwise he would be buried as an indigent outstanding performance of the cast in a very sad story that is reality in the poor countries my vote is eight br br title brazil não se escreve ao coronel' do not write to the colonel br br,1
by all the fawning people have been doing over miike and his work i sat through this flick tonight i figured if it's half as good as ringu as i assumed from these comments it might be than it will be worth my time br br no such luck br br i'm all for finding the next great director or writer but i don't think miike is the one i don't have an nyu masters of fine arts but i do know this much a horror movie has to have pacing it also has to give the viewer more credulity than this movie does br br this film's pacing had me shaking my head some of the scenes near the end dragged so badly i went to the fridge and lingered there while kou shibasaki stared at the camera for seemingly minutes on end eyes wide and mouth agape a famous director once made the claim and i'm paraphrasing a movie could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it roll kou is not a good enough actress to make that work she stares paralyzed at the undead girl for more scenes than i care to remember and she isn't the only one doing an impersonation of a deer in headlights other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this non performance the script gives them little room to do much else for far too much of the time br br i like asian cinema hong kong action flicks from the last 30 years korean horror like phone and koma ang lee's work some of the trashy but fun filipino movies with gratuitous sex and fighting as well as others chakushin ari i could have done without,0
thanks to this film i now can answer the question what is the worst movie you have ever seen br br i can't even think of a close second and i've seen some really bad movies br br absolutely nothing works in this film name a single element of any horror film and this movie fails honestly i've seen better on youtube here's some typical dialogue br br steve steve steve is that you steve i'm not kidding steve this isn't funny steve are you there steve steve steve br br arggh ahhhhhh nooooooo,0
this superior inferiority to the original dumb blind dead movie is another trash bin waste so many people have hyped up these films that i can't believe what they say about it since i was a kid i have heard about how scary and great these films are and i saw them all and was throughly disappointed was everyone on drugs from the 1970's or do they just not know how boring this crude is,0
this has to be the all time best computer animation classic even though most of the animations where experiments they have an artistic quality that has stood the test of time twelve years after it's release i have gone back to watch this video and found some inspiration for new types of computer graphics some of the techniques used in this video have never been full explored,1
i feel like i'm the only kid in town who was annoyed by branagh's performance he is a fine actor by most accounts but he simply could not pull off the southern accent i mean it was deplorable it was as if he was trying too hard to be a yank one of the previous reviewers questioned why u s actors were not cast in this film i second that notion it's wonderful when actors actresses wish to expand their horizons but it's another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained maybe it was altman but he's a such a great director br br well i really don't want to bash branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much everybody deserves to screw up here and there but it is hard to watch something so annoying that you'd rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through the gingerbread man,0
china o'brien 1990 was an attempt to make cynthia rothrock a star in the united states this golden harvet production was helmed by veteran director robert clouse sadly he was either lucky with enter the dragon or he's lost his touch because he's not that great of a director the only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of ms rothrock and richard norton if this movie was directed by corey yuen or hoi meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight to video action flick br br china o'brien returns home to help out her dad he's having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help so she returns home and restores order with the help of two unlikely people but will they be enough to topple mister big and his evil cronies br br if you're a big cynthia rothrock fan then this movie's catered for you i only enjoyed the fighting scenes everything else is rubbish why didn't raymond chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director br br recommended,1
this has to be the best adaptation i have seen it's my favourite and i think it stays very close to the book what really makes this a must see though is the casting of the two lead actors the wonderful timothy dalton is the best rochester i have seen on screen brooding and tragic while zelah clarke is the perfect combination of strength courage shyness and gentleness as jane the story as i'm sure most people know is this the young and plain jane eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the 1800's who advertises her services as a governess in the newspapers she is offered the post of governess at the big mansion thornfield hall to tutor adele the young ward of the halls mysterious and respected owner mr rochester as the months go on he falls in love with jane and puts into effect a few situations to try and see if jane is as madly in love with him as he is with her however there is a secret still waiting to be discovered at thornfield hall and when it is it's effects are devastating this is a moving and well acted drama with nice locations and gorgeous costumes plus as i said earlier excellent acting especially from zelah and timothy,1
this is a depressingly shallow naive and mostly unfunny look at a wildly improbable relationship between brooks' psychotic film editor and harold his vapid girlfriend the two have zero chemistry together primarily because harold is incapable of doing anything besides looking pretty at this stage of her career but also because brooks' character is neither interesting nor likeable there are 15 static excruciating minutes at the beginning where brooks having just broke up with harold stumbles about his apartment in a depressed drugged out state unbearable br br sappily and unimaginatively bookended by joe cocker's you are so beautiful there simply is not enough material here for a feature film there is hardly anything going on on the periphery of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world i'm sure brooks' intention was to shine a white hot spotlight on the affair and in a way deconstruct it but if you're going to do that the writing and acting needs to be far far better than what it is here,0
everyone knows about this ''zero day'' event what i think this movie did that elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were they showed their life for about a year throughout the movie we get to like them to laugh with them even though we totally know what they're gonna do and that gives me the chills cause i felt guilty to be cheered by their comments and i just thought cal was a sweet guy even though i knew what was gonna happen you know even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of 3 or 4 i thought this was funny but still i was horrified to see their heads blown off of course i was i got to like them they were wicked maybe but i felt like they were really normal guys that they didn't really realize it but i knew they were br br that's imo the main force of this movie it makes us realize that our friends or relatives or anyone can be planning something crazy and that we won't even notice it this movie as good as it was made me feel bad and that's why i can't go to sleep right now there's still this little feeling in my stomach butterflies,1
alone in the dark is one of my favorite role playing games of all time i remember spending whole nights facing the pc screen trying to escape that mansion and actually being startled at times when monsters came surprisingly charging in now mind you i am weary of computer game generated movies i don't remember a single success story in this new hollywood genre although some are entertaining enough to be watchable and yet i am such a big fan of the game that i couldn't resist my rationale was that if the movie had a plot that so much as resembled the game's it would be ok br br man those were 90 minutes which seemed like 300 of my life that i'll never get back if i had that chance i would have gladly spent them rearranging my sock drawer instead this isn't even in the so bad it's funny category you would think even christian slater had a bit more sense than joining this stink bomb now tara reid i'm not complaining about her presence however if the purpose of putting this chick in a starring role is to have a sex scene which i totally understand and support hey i'm a guy i've seen more of her body on press conferences br br there is no plot to speak of won't waste your time pitching it to you the credibility of the story sinks below 'i did not have sex with ms lewinski' the acting is but a few notches above 'street fighter' which by the way being one of the worst movies i've seen i would recommend over this one br br kids i recommend the video game it has far better story acting and much more thrills as for the movie here's a spoiler it stinks wait for the porno version,0
this was an absolutely terrible movie don't be lured in by christopher walken or michael ironside both are great actors but this must simply be their worst role in history even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline this movie is an early nineties us propaganda piece the most pathetic scenes were those when the columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions maria conchita alonso appeared phony and her pseudo love affair with walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning i am disappointed that there are movies like this ruining actor's like christopher walken's good name i could barely sit through it,0
i don't know who wrote the script for this movie but from the first moment on i was irritated of all possible decisions they could make up in the mountains why do they make the decision which is the most dangerous of all why do the criminals act dumb although they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it why doesn't the main criminal land the helicopter shoot stallone grab the money and fly away with the chick as a hostage and there are more cases of illogical behavior i'd give this movie 5 points for nice action and great landscape scenery but due to the illogical behavior of the characters i just can give this movie 1 point,0
what a fascinating film even if it wasn't based on real life forbidden lies was a fascinating portrait of a con artist in her element and it is the kind of film psychology students could study to learn about compulsive liars br br the author of forbidden love norma was revealed as a fraud in the media but this move really does give her ample opportunity to clear her name br br but the twists and turns she takes the documentary maker through are amazing what a patient woman i loved this movie i have not read the book but simply heard good reviews and went to see it on boring rainy afternoon the journey this film takes you on is clever interesting and totally engrossing,1
in a word this film was boring it lacked life and spark a big problem is with the two leads jude law and gwyneth paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever he was boring and she was annoying br br the visuals were interesting but they didn't enhance the scenes if anything the visuals tended to detach the audience from what was happening on screen none of the action sequences felt real and hence the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger br br the film had potential but it needed a better script better acting and a better director i kept thinking during the film you know this movie would've worked if harrison ford was sky captain karen allen was polly and steven spielberg was the director br br ignore the critical acclaims for this film the critics i think are praising the film because they want to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels,0
jammin' the blues is an oscar nominated short from 1944 that is basically 10 minutes of improvisational jazz played in one long jam marie bryant sings the sunny side of the street at one point for the film's highlight then jitterbugs with archie savage to bring this most entertaining jam session to its exciting end the director gojn mili was a photographer and that experience shows in some of the double exposure shots of some of the musicians that makes this one of the most innovative angles of the '40s according to some notes i read one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in silhouette in reflection of the social attitudes of the time what a shame still this most unusual film of the time is available on youtube so if you love jazz i suggest you seek it out there,1
i remember seeing this movie when i was about 7 and at the time it shocked me i had seen a violent movie before but i never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence this movie not only shows this but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness what this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful crash tried to show how racism was bad and crash actually had a built in anti asian bias and to come at it from a morally superior position grand canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash especially when you compare the endings the ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up while grand canyon simply ends on a quiet note where you know nothing much will change in the character's lives but that's because life just goes on too there's no suitable ending no matter how good bad you are there is no ending of a chapter to begin another,1
patricia hunter oh professor do you also make a habit of collecting coffins dr lorenz why yes in a manner of speaking i find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed br br interesting bela lugosi glen or glenda dracula vehicle where he plays the mad scientist i was especially creeped out when he appeared in the bedrooms of his guests when they were sleeping br br luana walters girls in prison was really appealing as a sensual reporter patricia hunter who was to be a victim but woman power trumps evil scientist every time br br 2'11 angelo rossitto and creepy frank moran who liked to stoke the women's hair added to the film br br interesting look at a 40s horror film,0
i don't'know maybe it's because i'm brazilian but all that stuff was too much too much love for the music too much parties too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters come on it's not so sad and the aspect of the city shown by the director everything looks too fake to me the families the relationships the music the happiness it simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture i must be honest it did seduce me a little but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music sex and parties i'm not that stupid what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea profound sadness and stds i liked the scene with caridad's mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the spanish people,0
if you want scream or anything like the big studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother this well written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense how children interpret the world and the violence in it our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends all here but not flatly on the surface you could technically call it a monster movie even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit beast some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores though in fact the less you see of the creature the better fessenden successfully continues george romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out,1
now i like sci fi cartoons however when robotboy appeared in canada in late 2006 i watched the premiere and was inevitably appalled the characters are generic and stereotypical do they really need to make an african american man wear tiger stripe print clothing and speak in a jamacian accent why are all the asian characters vibrant yellow and squinting does the mother have to have big thighs and chest and constantly complain to the point where things become unrealistic predictable gross and sometimes disturbing there are heavy similarities to even stabs at astro boy allow me to explain dub names for the young robotboy astro kamikaze tenma constantine shadow gus abercrombie tommy alejo lola zoran kennedy moshimo o'shay and it so on brief resemblances to my life as a teenage robot star wars teenage mutant ninja turtles kamen riders sailor moon and co are afoot not to mention the abundant racial gender stereotyping don't even get me started on the innuendos i'll just say they're hidden and quite dirty but seriously don't even try watching this especially if you like astro boy,0
this movie was god awful from conception to execution the us needs to set up a star wars site in this remote country this is their premise the way to gain access the us concludes is to win an obstacle course like cross country race where the winner can ask anything of the leader and who better to win this race known as the game than a gymnast of course a gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission and don't forget that his father was an operative lucky for our hero there happen to be gymnastic equipment in fortunate spots like the stone pommel horse in the middle of a square for no reason amidst crazy town perfect br br but above and beyond the horrible horibble premise is the awkward fumblings of the romantic scenes the obviously highly depressed ninjas whose only job seems to be holding a flag to point out the race path and the worst climax ever after winning the race our hero puts forth the wishes of the us government and lo and behold all the effort was worth it because the us gets its star wars site huzzah this is your triumphant ending wow br br but still being such a bad movie it can be great fun to watch the cover alone depicting ninjas with machine guns was enough to get me to rent this film br br but if i were ever to meet kurt thomas the gymnast star in real life i would probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 1 2 twists in the layout position,0
here's another film that doesn't really need much of a recommendation it's a classic comedy very funny and entertaining and which of course ultimately inspired a successful television series which many would say was even better i enjoy both personally br br for some it's hard to warm up to jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix unger and oscar madison when they were were weaned on the tv show starring tony randall and jack klugman or perhaps vice versa but what we've got there in both cases are four good actors who in real life seemed so much like their film counterparts that they managed to make these characterizations their own it's neil simon's humorous material that's key and where the laughs really originate from br br for those who have somehow never heard of the odd couple it's the story of a neurotic and fussy neat freak lemmon who is thrown out of a 12 year marriage by his long suffering wife and takes up residence in the manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy matthau pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes for some hugely funny predicaments,1
is there a movement more intolerant and more judgmental than the environmentalist movement to a budding young socialist joining the circus must seem as intimidating as joining a real circus even though such people normally outsource their brain to hollywood for these important issues the teachings of hollywood can often seem fragmented and confusing fortunately ed is here to teach neo hippies in the art of envirojudgementalism br br here you'll learn the art of wagging your finger in the face of anyone without losing your trademark smirk you'll learn how to shrug off logic and science with powerful arguments of fear you'll learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you by labeling it as the gateway to planetary armageddon br br in addition to learning how to lie with a straight face you'll also learn how to shrug off accusations that are deflected your way no matter how much of a hypocrite you are you'll be able to use as much energy as al gore yet while having people treat you as if you were amish br br in the second season was even more useful as we were able to visit other hollywood gods holy be thy names and audit i e judge their lifestyles note this is the only time it's appropriate for an envirofascist to judge another because it allows the victim the chance to buy up all sorts of expensive and trendy eco toys so that they can wag their finger in other people's faces br br what does ed have in store for us in season three maybe he'll teach us how to be judgmental while sleeping,0
a fun concept but poorly executed except for the fairly good makeup effects there's really not much to it there are obvious problems for example after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days and once he's deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long time br br in any case the movie has far worse problems than that the cinematography is decidedly low budget tv show quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around robert john burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling charlton heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch the only scary thing is that lucinda jenney and kari wuhrer are both even worse br br the only reason why i'm giving this movie as high as i am is that once the movie enters its last 1 3 or so and joe mantegna's character takes over the movie develops a fun campy 'cheesefest slaughterhouse' feel and the gangster's crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch the ending if predictable is also nicely mean avoid unless you're a king o phile or are really psyched up at the idea of the voice of fat tony from the simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp,0
a novel by remarque a cast that looks great on paper a left wing refugee struggling to remain in paris between the wars a gestapo officer undercover br br it's a pity there's no synergy here the bits and pieces never coalesce br br stories about left wing refugees in france don't have to be this dull read arthur koestler's memoir scum of the earth if you can find it or his chilling dialogue with death ditto br br to me the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details br br the leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados the norman apple brandy i welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself it certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly but according to the film it's only sold in cheap low class saloons vive le tabac parisien that's what i say references to intoxicating liquors do abound here that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenarists br br i enjoy films set in france because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable full size alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background i wasn't disappointed this time it was for byrrh a very unusual choice this film would rate a 10 if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze murals br br the film's indifferent score is by louis gruenberg gruenberg is best known if you can call it that for his opera the emperor jones based on the o'neill play it premièred at roughly the same time as the film version starring paul robeson the opera survives today in a recording or two by lawrence tibbett it should surface again soon though they're running out of potentially marketable operas to revive br br opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since charles boyer's character operates under his czech aliases two of them are wozzeck and gunther both prominent roles in german opera is that just coincidence br br name dropping just seems to be part of this film notice that they call up himmelstoss on the phone himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in remarque's earlier all quiet on the western front br br well the in jokes are all in place guess there wasn't time to develop any drama,0
great screenplay and some of the best actors the world has ever produced montand gives the concept of the 'lone wolf' police detective a whole new dimension of intensity and most importantly credibility br br when a typical hollywood cop heroe loses family friends and pets to murder he is usually given his minute of grief but when the sixty seconds are over he pulls himself together packs his gun and goes gleefully shooting up his enemies one by one br br montand's marc ferrot however is really devastated by his girlfriends murder of course but also by finding out that she had another lover in his confusion and wrath he does not seek revenge but needs to keep going to find the real perpetrator of a crime where his fingerprints are all over the scene thus all his actions become unescapably logical this is the main reason why this movie glues us to our seats but definetely not the only one,1
your first clue that this is a cheesy movie is that it was shot on video not film the story is convoluted and the production is amazingly sloppy note for example that when the title couple are on a plane ostensibly landing in vermont where they've gone to celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony the plane is shown coming into an airport surrounded by palm trees their ceremony in vermont takes place in a garden of tropical plants including palms which wouldn't last five minutes in the new england climate on yet another airplane trip the establishing shot depicts a fedex cargo plane taking off presumably they could only afford to travel in steerage as for the plot this movie expects you to believe that victor the devoutly christian brother of arthur is kicked out of his church when the congregation learns that his brother is gay not only that but the pastor eventually sets victor up with a hit man to have ben and arthur killed to purge their souls of sin apparently no one in this church has ever heard of the ten commandments were it not for jamie brett gabel who is surprisingly effective as arthur this movie would have no redeeming qualities at all,0
i first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it it's beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time it's difficult to believe this was made in 1946 as the tale is still fresh today and really makes one think i'm not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made in addition the acting is superb and the use of english and american actors quite astounding i recently purchased the dvd so now i'm able to watch whenever i wish i highly recommend anyone interested in post war british films to watch this,1
this is by far the worst horror thriller i've seen in my 29 years if someone offers this to you for free tell them no this movie makes you a dumber person for knowing you watched it the plot isn't even the worst part of this movie its the acting camera work lighting and sound there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie whoever paid to have this film made is broke now i hope the director never gets the greenlight for another movie in its defense this movie was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual btk killer's capture but i've seen movie of the weeks that looked like oscar winners compared to this,0
first of all what is good in the movie some pretty actress the exotic background the fact that the actors don't laugh while acting i would have if i had been in their situation i don't know the storyline is simple a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who another abstract painter killed his little brother a male prostitute raped by another priest when he was young i'm afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers art or religion dennis hopper is not very good here this is the worst episode of the worst season of profiler the serie with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences the uncle is the policeman who the girl who lives at another victim's house could have a baby with the priest etc etc,0
the plot is about a female nurse named anna is caught in the middle of a world wide chaos as flesh eating zombies begin rising up and taking over the world and attacking the living she escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer so far so good i usually enjoy horror movies but this piece of film doesn't deserve to be called horror it's not even thrilling just ridiculous even the flintstones or kukla fran and ollie will give you more excitement it's like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to get into a shopping mall to by more liquor the heroes who has locked themselves in inside the shopping mall to avoid being eaten by the hoodlums outside are not better either even though they doesn't seem to be drunk they give the impression of being mentally disabled save your money instead of spending it on this,0
based on a self serving novel by one time girl friend and groupie of f scott fitzgerald gossip columnist sheila graham wrote this trashy story gregory peck carries on in shameless excess as a forceful be drunk or be damned alcoholic in contradiction to the gentle and soft spoken real scott fitzgerald focusing on fitzgerald's hollywood writing era late in his life the much honored author was in fact living a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when aa was not yet well known fitzgerald was none too proud to be recycling his flapper stories in order to support both his wife in a mental hospital and his daughter in college living in a small apartment and driving a second hand chevrolet his life was 180 degrees different than as portrayed in this movie br br virtually every 20th century fox movie made during daryll f zanuck's leadership as well as virtually every film directed by henry king was a work of excellence beloved infidel was the exception,0
there have been a lot of zorro films made over the decades but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen br br zorro's fighting legion is a bit different from other zorro films first off it's a republic serial in 12 chapters and this time zorro is not played by a top studio star like douglas fairbanks tyrone power or antonio banderas but instead by workman like actor reed hadley while hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other he does an adequate job helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here as the title implies he has a fighting legion to call upon br br another big difference is that the setting isn't california the story here take place in central mexico in 1824 where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly established mexican republic something zorro and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop br br don't get me wrong there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode from corny twang bow sound effects to ludicrous acting but overall this represents one of the best republic serials of all time and probably the best zorro one br br the plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering and there's lots of great action fans of the indiana jones movies will notice many bits borrowed from this serial,1
this is hardly a movie at all but rather a real vaudeville show filmed for the most part in proscenium and starring some of the greatest stage stars of the day singing in the bathtub is an absolutely amazing production number that must be seen be sure to wear your shower cap,1
there should be a sub genre in the western called 'the robert mitchum western' mitchum's brilliant idiosyncratic usually undervalued westerns import his film noir persona to etch some compellingly dark character sketches and bring an elegiac world weariness more familiar from the films of sam peckinpah 'man with the gun' is one of his best directed by orson welles protege richard wilson it is a stark monochrome beauty full of chilling silhouettes and terrifying outbursts of savage violence as mitchum comes to tame a town terrorised by a monopolist with a private army mitchum's regression from soft spoken stranger to deranged murderer with a host of dark emotions in between is a marvel of expressive physical acting,1
this su k why do they have to make movies that they must know su k from the beginning i mean look at alien from 1977 if the movie you´r about to make is not better than anything made billions of years before why make it i had problems with the plot and who the main character was that's not good either,0
the movie shocked me personally i had herd mostly bad buzz well finally after owning the dvd for months now i pooped it in on a sleepless night though the movie did drag the extra footage was used with purpose the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from addition to the game would have been less realistic if they had left out any scenes the best thing about the movie is it's consistency with the relationship there were no ex's popping up or characters threatening the relationship i mean typically we see the girl meets boy by some amazing twist of fate they date something we saw coming breaks them up up and then they get back together in the last five minutes of the movie but this movie did not follow that mold we actually experienced the relationship and it's flaws and though the characters did have there moments of anti love they did not have dramatic pauses were they went off and did a montage every 15 and then reunite in love again i did not feel the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance movies the story was unique and truthful to reality in the way that i felt these people in the film were the most believable that i have seen in a romance film from modern times and it did not hurt that all the baseball games were real and they were at the actual world series so fate kicked in a little there also it's no my fair lady but it is a spirited and honest film i'll simply say i like it,1
excellent view of a mature woman that is going to lose everything even the pruner has a mortgage the way she gets involved into this special business the innocence and the true love that exists between the people of a little town it's mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh light and funny comedy i couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore br br i love european films and with movies like this one my opinion grows stronger a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed in this same genre is waking ned devine br br saving grace a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself you will love it,1
a pretty obvious thriller by numbers in which the only possible twist turns out to be a hiding to nothing i was watching principally for the english language performance by isabelle huppert it wasn't great but then it was a strange role i wouldn't be surprised if half her contribution turned out to have been left on the cutting room floor along with several last minute script re writes br br the acting is the least appealing thing about this film steve guttenburg looks like he's trying to flesh out his role with the charm that everyone's told him he has there's a sensationally stupid sequence in which it's suggested that his sexual prowess will be able to help treat ptsd it's an uninteresting performance elizabeth mcgovern is more of a draw with genuine charm and character but it's small consolation 3 10,0
a hilarious and insightful perspective of the dating world is portrayed in this off beat comedy by first time writer director peter m cohen the story unfolds as the four male protagonists meet weekly at the local diner to confer about their dating woes we meet brad a good looking wall street playboy with a quick wit and sharp tongue zeek a cynical sensitive writer jonathan a sexually perplexed nice guy with an affinity for hand creams and masturbation and eric the married guy who cherishes his weekly encounters with his single friends in hope for some enlightenment to his boring and banal married existence the trials and tribulations of the men's single lives in new york are amusingly expressed mirroring that of sex in the city and hbo's new comedy the mind of married man and bring an astute light to scamming the story takes a twist as the three singletons meet mia wittily played by amanda peet and all fall for her she seduces them each with her uncanny ability to conform to the personalities' they exhibit when they come to realize they have all met and fallen in love with the same woman they chose her over their friendship whipped is a realistic portrayal of the dating world one that the critic's failed to recognize in plain language they missed the point the protagonist's here are caricatures of real people the exaggerations are hysterical mixing satire and humility and are not to be taken as seriously as the critic's disparagement suggests see this movie you'll laugh from start to finish,1
this thing was bad really bad i mean low budget can sometimes be very inspiring but not this the story was so off the shelf the alien's behaviour so illogical the characters so clichéed i found nothing good in it and i did try,0
beyond a shadow of a doubt mysterious planet is one of the worst movies ever made yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes and to be honest that's all you need to see combine to create something that is hilariously side splitting br br the opening scene in 'space' is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets as washing up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue before you've had time to work out whether it's you who's gone mad the credits roll and the action struggles to life br br and aside from the double headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices and the dubbed voices at the same time pure genius br br the sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that i've only ever seen one copy so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely perhaps i own the only copy in existence br br,0

it's kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece i am not a dullard as far as quality films go and i will agree that from a technical filming standpoint as well as for several of the characters portrayed the film is in an award worthy class but there is no sense for me of this film actually going anywhere i mean taking the viewer anywhere it is a series of mood scenes perhaps remarkable as such but i want more from a film i look for story and movement and a fulfillment of arrival none of which did i find in this film yes it might be considered poetry on film but there is much poetry that i cannot live with for the same reason that it paints pictures without going anywhere br br one thing further to be said is that it documents a mid century english childhood which is necessarily limited in its universality i was personally appalled at what a young british boy had to live through in that time and place having grown up in america just a decade earlier i can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense i cannot help wondering if this contrast has had some effect on those reviewing the film so favorably in other words could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its 'filmic magic' which i acknowledge is there and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of one's actual recalled experience,0
i've never actually seen this film but can tell you one thing about its production while a comedy oldies radio dj in 1988 i got a call from the production company they asked if i'd write and record a bit they'd drop into the soundtrack as sounds eminating from a tv the television screen itself would never be shown i said sure wrote a parody of '50s sci fi monster clichés rounded up some sound effects and called in another dj pam landry to play the female part as she happened to be on the air at the time she put on a long song joined me at the mike in the production room and we cut the voicetrack in a single take giggling she then went back to her show while i mixed in the goofy sound effects we'd have never done it if we'd known that woodchipper massacre was going to be such a turkey but then again we never got paid for our efforts either gary theroux,0
this film has a lot of strong points it has one of the best horror casts outside of the lugosi karloff chaney circle lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye plus leading man melvyn douglas it's got all the right ingredients bats a castle with lots of stone staircases a mad scientist townspeople waving torches and hunting vampires an igor type character a beautiful girl even a goofy haired burgomeister the soft focus camera work is moody and imaginative there's even some good comic relief nicely spaced throughout the script br br but it's not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in kleinschloss little castle the plot revolves around the generic crazy scientist nicely played by atwill who values his work more highly than human lives br br it's not top tier material because of a ho hum resolution of the plot and some embarrassingly bad dialog for dwight frye but it's worth a look if you like early b w horror pictures,1
i can't believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie the gingerbread man starts of on the right foot and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending but at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories i've ever wasted my time on it's just so unbelievably how the bewitched mallory doss manages to pull kenneth branagh's character around by his nose the movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer which has been left out in the sun too long the gingerbread man is probably the worst grisham movie ever and this isn't changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie don't waste your time here,0
many reviews here explain the story and characters of 'opening night' in some detail so i won't do that i just want to add my comment that i believe the film is a wonderful affirmation of life br br at the beginning myrtle gordon is remembering how 'easy' it was to act when she was 17 when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth experience has left her emotionally fragile wondering what her life has been for and indeed if she can even continue living a tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her br br almost but not quite at the eleventh hour she rediscovers the power of her art and reasserts herself i'm going to bury that bastard she says of fellow actor maurice as she goes on stage it seems almost sadistic when myrtle's director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance he knows however that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to make it at all br br some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on myrtle's downward path i believe this is truly her 'opening night' she opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action she sees a way forward it is tremendously moving br br gena rowlands is superb the film is superb thank you mr cassavetes wherever you are,1
brokedown palace is not the kind of movie i would ever like to see i also did not like the movie when some aussie man smuggled drugs in thailand and accused claire danes and kate beckinsale of drug smuggling i would not go to that country no matter what after i saw this movie in fact this movie stinks i prefer to visit germany to meet beautiful single women germany is the country i tolerate i also would rather stick to the united states instead after i saw some of the movie in the theatre including the false accusation of drug smuggling i left the theatre and had my money refunded because i cannot tolerate this movie if you are going to to thailand to meet someone there who could be a drug smuggler forget this,0

this movie purports to be a character study of perversion some reviewers have been gulled into assuming that because perversion is depicted the film is psychologically deep actually considering the salacious material it is surprisingly tedious and shallow with no motivational substance why is the main character the way she is you won't find out from the script for a better treatment of the same theme and a more entertaining movie try bunuel's belle de jour,0
they filmed this movie out on long island where i grew up my brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer which they told me was colored water tasted disgusting and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again especially in the funnel scenes yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form it never came out in the theaters obviously and it as far as i knew was never released on video and i'm sure wasn't released on dvd yet it looks like it was seen by some people albeit it probably very few so there must be something i would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother yet there is no way i can find it anywhere does anybody know anything about when where how this movie could be purchased and which format that would be,1
preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath stanley kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings assuming the identity of a second unit director he murdered br br film pokes gleeful fun at hollywood with a tongue in cheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresses looking for a way up the ladder and dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight brian krause who i thought was dreadful overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced portrays the loud temperamental director who doesn't like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer alison played by dahlia salem seem to be taking over the production andrew moxham is paul parsons who is the brother of a victim from the first film the film's dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it's worth nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty with stanley as clever as ever using his brains to commandeer a film production killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work letting no one stand in his way that is until alison realizes who stanley really is alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject what motivated stanley to kill why would he do such a thing and what led such a man down this dark path the humor of alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller of course you get the inevitable showdown between alison and stanley with a really ridiculous unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer's fate quite a hard pill to swallow unlike the first film which was photographed with sophisticated polish director po chih leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles slow motion in a sepia color and several instances which are captured on video and rather annoy instead of impress this sequel to me just wasn't on target as much as the original with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious,0
in 1967 mine workers find the remnants of an ancient vanished civilization named abkani that believe there are the worlds of light and darkness when they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago something evil slipped through before the gate was closed twenty two years ago the government paranormal research agency bureau 713 was directed by professor lionel hudgens matthew walker who performed experiments with orphan children on the present days one of these children is the paranormal investigator edward carnby christian slater who has just gotten an abkani artifact in south america and is chased by a man with abilities when an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night he discloses that demons are coming back to earth with the support of the anthropologist aline cedrac tara reid and the leader of the bureau 713 cmdr richard burke stephen dorff and his squad they battle against the evil creatures br br in spite of having a charismatic good cast leaded by christian slater tara reid and stephen dorff alone in the dark never works and is a complete mess without development of characters or plot the reason may be explained by the brilliant interview of director uwe boll in the extras of the dvd where he says that videogames are the bestsellers of the younger generations that are not driven by books anymore further his target audience would be people aged between twelve and twenty five years old sorry but i find both assertions disrespectful with the younger generations i have a daughter and a son and i know many of their friends and they are not that type of stupid stereotype the director says further imdb provides excellent statistics to show that mr uwe boll is absolutely wrong my vote is three br br title brazil alone in the dark  o despertar do mal alone in the dark  the awakening of the evil,0
one of the most disturbing and tragic periods in american history began the members of the summer of love culture at the end of the seventies and onset of the 80's were eventually tool old for love beads and all night parties and evolved back into mainstream life whatever that meant for those who could not out grow their youthful and sometimes irrational exuberance their's was the culture of wonderland a love for drugs and a sense of entitlement coupled with a distaste for authority values and the establishment is the world that the film captures br br the sixties were a time of revolution and violent change that tore the american house apart once the battles were over we all had to deal with the aftermath of the carnage the characters in the wonderland house are icons of the misfits of the seventies part biker part hippie part crook all outcast no ideology to express just a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and allegiance to nothing ron billy and david fancy themselves as some sort of robin hoods with dope they talk of love and behave violently they take from the rich and sell to the misbegotten they steal from everyone br br holmes and company are the end result of a strange collision of anti matter like sex and drugs and rock roll when the lab technicians get bored and move on br br the film is skillfully directed and paced and captures the frenetic world of the drug fiends in their element the fact that holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant that story was told in boogie nights this is a story of a transitional and forgettable era,1
this is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist and am i glad he did the blend of british humor should i say humour and the reality of a lost middle aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot those plants under the bushes were not going to make it without the tlc they received and it is a truly hilarious yet touching film i laugh every time i conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights maybe it's just my mendocino county blood but the brits definitely got this one right 10 10,1
i searched out this one after seeing the hilarious and linguistically challenging clueless 1995 perhaps alicia silverstone's best known effort from early in her film career true crime has kevin dillon which should be helpful in improving most film projects in fact everyone in the cast does a good job the only disappointment i think the movie has for me is an awkward feel to some of the scenes coming from the need to run a quite uncompromising grown up theme as part of what in tone starts out as a schoolgirl adventure br br alicia silverstone is pretty good in this one she carries off well the naive enthusiasm and growing unease that affects mary giordano as she manoeuvres towards the truth behind the serial murders i reckon her characterization of mg has some mileage in it too the inference of the story line is that she goes on to a career in law enforcement it could be really interesting for an older silverstone to revisit giordano at a time of crisis later in the officer's life just a thought br br true crime shows its director in a good light pat verducci also has the writing credit i don't know of any other film work pv has done i can only wonder what happened after such a promising start br br like most productions this one has a largely unknown supporting cast although bill nunn detective jerry guinn is hardly that over the past decade he seems to have been able to secure an impressive number of screen appearances i recall seeing him recently in carriers 1998 a made for tv presentation with a military theme bill nunn played captain arends fans of the classic us tv comedy show who's the boss may also have an interest in carriers because the leading player is judith light remembered with affection by many because of her lengthy involvement with the show br br true crime could easily not have worked but it does ok i think it is an entertaining story worth seeing,1
who in the world told harrison ford that this was a good role for him br br and josh hartnett how does a 19 year old who can't fire a gun become a cop over used cliches plus zero character development and about 15 pointless music industry cameos equal a surprisingly bad film,0
how can you tell that a horror movie is terrible when you can't stop laughing about it of course the plot has been well covered by other reviewers so i'll just add a few things on the hilarity of it all br br some reviews have placed the location in south america others in africa i thought it was in some random island in the pacific where exactly does this take place seems to be a mystery the cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men and a man who looks like a young frank zappa banging the drums the devil god is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyes br br one of the freakiest moments in the film is when pablito find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that i assume is blood starts screaming for minutes on and on that's actually funny and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and pablito kicks it a bit for what i assume is shits n' giggles and the eyes actually move br br but of course then the freak is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just bad br br i hadn't laughed like this in a loooong while and i definitely recommend this film for a sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do grab a case of beers and start watching this film you'll love it if you are looking for a real horror or gore movie though don't' bother,0
amazing grace has a languid feel to it as it tells a contemporary story of various lives in an apartment building the language spoken is hebrew but the drama could take place in any modern city it observes family values romantic relationships and age group characteristics with equal aplomb it does not judge the characters only present them in a straight forward manner as they strive to work out their individual problems in this modern world the quality of acting is very good and the observations made on the characters are astute and sharp i appreciate this flowing film very much,1
cashing in on the demons meets clergy trend of the late '60s early '70s that most prominently included the triptych of rosemary's baby the exorcist and the omen the sentinel is an addition that's just as good albeit the most overlooked of the lot in a way it combines the best elements of those films and tosses in a dash of polanski's the tenant which came out the same year for good measure a new york model unable to commit to her lawyer boyfriend takes up residence in a moss coated townhouse that initially seems like the perfect locale she meets a wily old coot of a neighbor the brilliant burgess meredith plus the other off center tenants kept awake by loud noises above her apartment she soon discovers that a mute priest and herself are the only residents in the otherwise deserted building from there director michael winner death wish kicks this supernatural thriller into gear and there is a devilish glee to the hallucinogenic tortures he inflicts on his heroine aided by a brilliant ensemble cast a subtle storyline and excellent makeup fx by dick smith the exorcist the sentinel is a genuinely creepy horror flick,1
truly shows that hype is not everything shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife amitabh as always is solid ajay devgan as always is shitty and useless and the new guy is a joke the leading lady is such a waste of an actor such pathetic movie from such a revered director and from such a big industry with movies as such i have decreased the amount of bollywood movies i watch br br rgv has been making very crappy movies for a while now time to get different actors hrithek anyone bollywood needs madhuri and kajol back every other leading lady is a half naked wanna be pffffft,0
i love a good sappy love story and i'm a guy but when i rented love story i prayed for the end to come as quickly and painlessly as possible and just the opposite for ali mcgraw's character br br ali mcgraw as jenny alienated and irritated the heck out of me within the first 15 minutes when we learn that she has been diagnosed with a life threatening illness i couldn't help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss for poor oliver or if anyone watching this film would even care if she didn't die her grating personality would probably have pushed oliver over the edge and eventually landed them in divorce court br br people love this movie but it's one of the worst of the 70's,0
mel gibson's braveheart was a spectacularly accomplished film but it left a sour taste in the mouth rob roy by contrast is slightly less polished but a better film by far this is a historical film which combines timeless themes with truly historical values whereas braveheart put a gross and unpleasant comtemporary gloss on an ancient tale what makes this film is the cast liam neeson plays the hero in a role he basically reprised in a watered down fashion in the phantom menace the character is heroic but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover admirable yet human he commands the screen against him are set a selection of equally human adversaries including tim roth's cunningham obnoxious but brilliant and john hurt's morally bankrupt laird also to praise is jessica lange as rob's pragmatic wife also strong and noble but 300 years away from a modern heroine which is only as it should be this is not the most original film you will see but it has the courage of its own convictions and the strong performances make you care,1
i love horror movies i can even appreciate most cheese face it 9 out of 10 horror films these days are cheese but this was just ridiculous terrible acting terrible writing completely hollow and unbelievable characters no meisner actors here and a total lack of sufficient body count i wish i could salvage the 79 minutes of my life i just wasted at least the crook brothers are aptly named the only good thing about the whole film was watching the alicia silverstone wanna be get punched in the face how this ever made it to sundance is completely baffling to me most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic even by slasher film standards i mean come on who would rush out to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after a creepy stalker guy just left their doorstep lame,0
he really lost the plot with this one none of his distinctive trademarks here at all an uninteresting plot and completely terrible acting make this his worst film in my opinion even his trademark gore is gone bar one scene in an operating theatre oh well at least his next film 'nightmare concert' showed that he could still shock when he wanted to,0
when i go to see a movie about zombie's i'm not expecting oscar calibre performances or writing on the level of the godfather but i do expect the actors to at least not look like their straining to read their cue cards and dialogue that doesn't sound like it was typed out 10 minutes before the actor reads it into the camera this movie was just awful i actually got up and left about 25 minutes in and went next door and watched cold creek manor that wasn't very good either but it seemed like citizen kane compared to this pile of crap on the plus side the girls were very pretty that's probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first 5 minutes in fact i left after the hottest one got killed there wasn't anything to hold my interest after that,0
i don't know what would be so great about this movie even worse why should anyone bother seeing this one first of all there is no story one could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling laughter cry fear but in my opinion this movie does not do that either br br you are just watching images for 2 hrs there are more useful things to do br br i guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above but is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 eur of your money for me the answer is no,0
this is absolutely the worst trash i have ever seen when i saw it in the theater arghhh it took 15 full minutes before i realized that what i was seeing was the feature not a sick joke,0
i don't understand why the other comments focus on mcconaughey he has never been a very interesting film actor br br the best part of this movie is the writing and the wit alfred molina and patrick mcgaw make an unusual comic duo definitely not stock types although one can't say their characters are well developed that doesn't make them any less funny br br the version i saw was on hdnet and had subtitles for the spanish dialog so that was certainly not a problem the use of spanish gives it more authenticity br br a very underrated movie judging by the unusually low score imdb members have given it i thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least a lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting,1

holly is an issue driven film but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental at its heart is it is a character driven film which wouldn't be nearly so successful without the fleshed out portrayals of patrick ron livingston the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience and holly thuy nguyen the strong willed but ultimately over matched young vietnamese girl from the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing everything is forthright and well done the contemporary classical score may put some off at first but it is top notch composition and underscores the admirable restraint which is evident throughout this film which raises many issues but provides few clear cut answers ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for holly and the many who share her plight kudos to those who managed to get it made,1
quite the most boring nonsense i have seen in a long time the plot was full of irrelevance and the acting was the worst i have seen in a long time br br to make it worse camera angles that made me feel sick were used the incidental music was terrible and drowned out the dialogue maybe not a bad thing then and the shots of san francisco looked as if they had been stolen straight out of the city tourist board's promotional video br br oh and the obligatory sex scene was not even half well done better lighting next time please,0
you know you're in trouble when john cassavetes is operating at half speed instead of full throttle in a movie and the incubus is a dreadful worst case scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills actually observing the hammy script and john hough's 'baroque' art direction one can hardly blame him the movie has something to do with a series of rape murders going on in a small town with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in somehow the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene and cassavetes seems visibly p o 'ed at times the incubus itself which doesn't show up until the last scene is a well done creation but it's not worth waiting for br br 1 10,0

i for one have shamelessly enjoyed every episode of pushing daisies this season and hope that the writers' strike won't brutally end the beginnings of a very good show ned is a pie maker who owns a restaurant in the middle of town and has a secret talent emmerson is a private investigator with his own unique quirks like his love of knitting charlotte chuck is the once dead but not anymore childhood friend and sunny spot of ned's life olive is the jealous but good hearted waitress oh and add the dog jim dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration of the show chuck ned and emmerson along with olive and occasionally the dog solve multiple murder mysteries with the assistance of ned's special gift of bringing dead people back to life the show is funny clean and romantic in a very cute and good hearted way and i'd recommend it to anyone,1
no movie with dennis hopper gary busey erika eleniak tom berenger dean stockwell marilu henner deserves a rating under 5 on here this is a poor mans version of movies like 16 blocks or the timeless midnight run except the prisoner being transported here is the very easy on the eye ms eleniak tom berenger plays another gruff maverick military type well and william mcnamara plays his rookie about to be discharged foil well the plot on the face of it is absurd because i lost count of the times eleniak should have and could have escaped but this is an entertaining feel good movie and there are good cameos from all of the above actors that keep the movie rolling this isn't really a family movie as there is some swearing and a rare nude scene with eleniak but this is a lot better than some of the other guff that came out around this time,1
unless you are an evangelical christian then make like an egyptian and avoid like the biblical plague br br awful why oh why does imdb list the most favourable reviews at the top of the list it was due to one of these that i have just wasted the end of what started out as good evening on this claptrap br br the plot premise started out strong enough i was drawn into the film and was interested right up to the point where the bible sermons took over what a waste br br this film has so incensed me that i have registered with imdb for the first time just to complain about it i hope at least that by doing so i save someone else's evening br br hay what a christian act on my part,0

if you watched this movie you know why i said jesus jesus jesus hehehe every time they said jesus jesus jesus i laughed thinking jesus jesus jesus why did i rent this movie i cannot believe how oscar winners like freeman and spacey appeared here in the background while timberlake and ll cool j grabbed the screen wtf is timberlake dreaful acting i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him but i really prefer an actor not this android called timberlake and his girlfriend was shallow hollow and annoying as hell i was happy when they both were popped in the street br br the story was ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role very well the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all it would have been much enjoyable without him br br by the way the music was ok but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a mtv video clip with flashes low motion and things like that something misplaced for this cops movie i thought maybe they wanted to make a mtv video clip for timberlake,0
this movie was just plain bad just about every cop movie cliché is present and accounted for bad guy gets away check partner check wacky personality clash with partner check rookie with something to prove check rookie shows up grizzled veteran check about the only ones it didn't touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but i guess they're saving those old chestnuts for dooley's next outing add in the battle of the sexes with girl power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like dooley's prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie avoid this one at all costs,0
memoirs of a geisha is a visually stunning melodrama that seems more like a camp drag queen satire than anything to do with real people br br the first half of the film defensively keeps insisting that geishas are neither prostitutes nor concubines that they are the embodiment of traditional japanese beauty but other than one breathtaking dance the rest of the movie degenerates into pretty baby in storyville territory or at least vashti and esther in the purim story as all the women's efforts at art and artifice are about entertaining much much older drunken boorish men maybe it is japanese culture that is being prostituted and not just to the american louts after world war ii br br perhaps it's the strain of speaking in english but ziyi zhang shows barely little of the great flare she demonstrated in house of flying daggers shi mian mai fu and hero ying xiong michelle yeoh occasionally gets to project a glimmer of her assured performance in crouching tiger hidden dragon wo hu cang long only li gong shows any real life otherwise i kept picturing charles ludlam in various roles or even cillian murphy as in kabuki theater particularly as the plot dragged down in cat fight after cat fight br br the supposed love story has zero chemistry mostly due to the age differences and i mostly felt sorry for ken watanabe and hoped his hollywood pay check compensated for his loss of dignity as the mysterious chairman i remember more emotion in portrait of jennie as the young girl is anxious to grow up into jennifer jones to please joseph cotton br br we see brief glimpses of reality when the geishas pose with regular women as photographic attractions and as an ageless ziyi zhang lives out the war years in a very colorful kimono dying operation the finale has little sense of normality br br the score includes many chopped up traditional melodies with cello by yo yo ma and violin by yitzhack pearlman instead of traditional instrumentation that are beautiful to listen to in accompaniment to the lovely cinematography as long as one completely ignores the plot and stiff acting br br as my mind wandered i wondered how the great japanese directors of samurai movies would have dealt with this story which probably would have been more formal but a lot more emotional,0
from reading all of the comments posted here on imdb this movie seems to get ragged on a lot but i didn't think it was that bad i've seen much worse actually br br the house where evil dwells is a ghost story about a husband and his wife ted and laura fletcher and their daughter amy who move into an old house in japan little do they know a japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword as strange things happen in the house the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living and plan on re enacting the bloody murder that took place 100 years back br br i saw this movie and decided to give it a chance from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story it was routine and it was corny but i've seen worse in my day the ghost sequences were a little over done we get to see the translucent blue tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family and take over their bodies to be honest the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disneyland i may be mistaken but after watching this it seemed to me that the japanese horror film ju on the grudge and the american remake of that film ripped this off a little the old japanese home where a brutal murder took place ghostly activity curses put on the home etc but i may be wrong br br to sum it up this is a pretty corny ghost story don't go out of your way to see it but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on tv you can give it a shot 4 10,0

i loved anchorman the legend of ron burgundy and hoped this would be just as funny but alas it wasn't some bits are excellent though i thought the sports guy champ kind professing his love for ron burgundy in the car filled with the other members of the news team was hilarious everyone is ignoring him and he just gets louder and louder and finally kisses burgundy which doesn't get acknowledged either but on the whole the story doesn't gel it's a noble attempt however to salvage the unused bits from the first movie including an entire plot about some pretty benign would be domestic terrorists called the alarm clock maya rudolph of saturday night live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines but basically this unused plot line has good reason to be unused in the first movie the extras on this disk are pretty good with the best two being the filmed rehearsals featuring lots of improv comedy and the faux commentary with will ferrell and an exec producer who ferrell discovers early on was not even a part of the movie in any way shape or form turns out he's just a guy who walked in the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer it's some pretty funny stuff though and goes on for about 10 or 15 minutes,0
anyone who does not find this movie funny does not understand simple comedy this movie is not a complex comedy it is full of one liners and sight gags and will make anyone who wants to laugh laugh the alien who is doing a nicholson impression will crack you up,1

if you like star wars trek come see where they got all their ideas and cinematic devices it's my top 2 favorite movies of all times other worldly futuristic and psycho thriller the intensity of the root material shakespeare's the tempest is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry a la later lucas and just because it was made in 1956 don't assume you can 'see the strings' holding the flying saucer up this was the first movie where you couldn't miracle it was made at a movie scale economics and tastes at the time were stacked heavily against it and director wilcox's previous 'hit' was lassie come home until i looked him up i assumed 'fred wilcox' was a pseudonym for a director who was already or later became famous but at the time didn't want to be associated with sci fi which was strictly a b genre back then this was either a very very visionary production or a very fortuitous 'mistake' on the part of the folks who bankroll hollywood br br there are the massive scale mattes with live action almost microscopically inserted that lucas used extensively there are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotypical 'user interface' computers as they've come to be portrayed much less futuristically in later works star trek's 'transporter' is there visually almost unaltered by roddenberry 10 years later and if the trek wars technobabble turns you off fp's scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate even today the ship set is comprehensive sparklingly realistic as good as anything you've seen since and more convincing than anything 'trek' has done for tv or film we didn't get to spend as much time there as i would have liked br br if you ever wondered how movies got into space so competently watching fp will explain all that it's definitely not 'wagontrain to the stars',1
enjoyable in spite of leslie howard's performance mr howard plays philip as a flat uninteresting character one is supposed to feel sorry for this man however i find myself cheering bette davis' mildred ms davis gives one her finest performances she received an academy award nomination thanks to her performance she brings this rather dull movie to life be sure not to miss when mildred tells philip exactly how she feels about him,1
holes is not your average disney stuff it's very very fun even for adults who usually cringe at the cutesy focus group designed family entertainment that uncle walt's studio passes off as live action perhaps the secret of this film's success is in its faithfulness to the original book which is a little bit darker than your average kid stuff the action begins when stanley yelnats is sent to a boys' prison camp where all the inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of rehibilitation but as the story progresses stanley's tale becomes interwoven with that of a legendary treasure and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any disney movie about an all boy prison camp has any right to be jon voight is especially nasty and colorful and sigourney weaver is beautiful as always,1
the math aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this tv show apart from the millions of other cop shows the only redeeming aspect to this show is rob morrow although his career must have been undeservedly waning after northern exposure if he signed up for this schlock br br the lame ness of the math aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co starring lou diamond phillips which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned in order to catch a fugitive the mathematician uses some theory about bubbles so he gives this long explanation that if we have seen the suspect in places a b and c then we can use bubble theory to calculate where he might be he does this all on a chalkboard or maybe with a stick in the dirt i cant remember br br anyway when you look at the finished product he basically took three spots and picked a point right in the middle and said ok mathematically here's where we are most likely to find the fugitive at which point one other character points out oh that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live is that math its not even connect the f k g dots this show reminds me of the math major i used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to support points that every one else had already agreed on through either less complex analysis or basic common sense br br it just goes to show when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail i can't wait til they stick the numb3rs team on osama they'll use calculus call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains and hit osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields cuz hey its all about the numbers br br totally ludicrous tv show,0
watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 bucks for rental in my life if nothing catastrophic happens before i die this will be the biggest regret of my life who ever even thought about this movie or financed deserves a kick between the legs because that's where they were thinking when they made this movie it's about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic and writes pretentious drivel that tries to pass off as poetry he joins his amorous friend in a trip to the coast where they meet girls and such only the fat guy doesn't get a girl skin flicks don't annoy me i take 'em for face value but this movie tries to be more than a skin flick it's about fat guy looking for love in some girl but then meets another bikini silicone girl that enjoys his poetry he finds his talent for volleyball which gets money for his family and impresses the ladies only he has his lady anyways the dialogue is super horrible for even a c movie it supports a ton of black stereotypes no character development it's a glorified porno movie without any porn in it never ever watch this movie,0

the creators of south park in their own film here this is a brilliant film with a huge entertainment factor if you like naked gun films and are not young and not too mature or serious on your humor you'll love this,1
i've seen a great many films but 'in cold blood' stands alone in a class by itself it excels in every department the fact that it contained few big stars helps push it over the top as you pay closer attention to the characters and their story rather than the name on the marquee blake and wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo the fact that much of the films is filmed in the actual locations where the crime took place even inside the very house add additional chills the black white photography darkens the mood and the photography is magnificent there are many outstanding cinematic works out there but if i could only vote for one to top the list it would most probably be in cold blood,1
walt disney's cinderella takes a story everybody's familiar with and embellishes it with humor and suspense while retaining the tale's essential charm disney's artists provide the film with an appealing storybook look that emanates delectable fairy tale atmosphere it is beautifully if conventionally animated the highlight being the captivating scene where the fairy godmother transforms a pumpkin into a majestic coach and cinderella's rags to a gorgeous gown mack david al hoffman and jerry livingston provide lovely songs like a dream is a wish your heart makes and bibbidi bobbidi boo that enhance both the scenario and the characters br br even though cinderella's story is predictable it provides such thrilling melodrama that one shares the concerns and anxieties of the titular heroine and her animal friends both the wicked stepmother and her dreadful cat lucifer present a formidable menace that threatens the dreams and aspirations of cinderella and the mice it is this menace that provides the story with a strong conflict that holds the viewers' interest the film's suspense however is nicely balanced by a serene sweetness especially in the musical numbers it is in these segments that reveal the appealing personalities of cinderella and her friends moving the viewers to care for them overall walt disney's cinderella is wonderful family entertainment that has held up remarkably well after half a century,1
what kind of a documentary about a musician fails to include a single track by the artist himself unlike ray or countless other films about music artists half the fun in the theater or on the couch is reliving the great songs themselves here all the tracks are covers put on by uninteresting characters and these renditions fail to capture cohen's slow jazzy style more often the covers are badly sung folk versions yuck br br the interviews are as much or more with other musicians and figures rather than with cohen himself only rarely does the film feature cohen reading his own work never singing like letters poems etc the movie really didn't capture much about the artist's life story either or about his development through the years a huge disappointment for a big cohen fan,0
recap the morning after his bachelor party paul is woken by his mother in law to be and discovers that there is a woman sleeping beside him unfortunately its a waitress from the bar and not his fiancée and suddenly she turns up everywhere the toll booth at the freeway and at his parent in laws dinner and it is hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex boyfriend had him followed and photographed it is not only about saving his wedding it is about survival br br comments actually much better than expected not the sweet romantic comedy i expected but something much funnier something with a little edge this movie wasn't afraid to take the jokes a little further and jason lee does now how to deliver comedy especially when his character is half panicked and deep in trouble as he is here and he got nice support from beautiful ladies julia stiles and selma blair and actually i thought lochlyn munro did a nice part as the ex br br so more emphasis on comedy than romance and the end result was good i enjoyed it very much br br 7 10,1
br br i didn't see they call me trinity but this sequel is really unfunny at all it has many gags that are supposed to make people laugh i guess the filmmaker just don't have the talent to do it right wonder why it was so popular in the 70s,0
what an utter disappointment the score of 6 1 here on imdb built up some mild expectations but oh my was i disappointed the first thing that bugs me are those braindead stereotyped university kids yes i know teens can be childish and so on but why are they in movies always portrayed as complete braindead morons there was one character that i thought was alright but he she not revealing it here was killed off way before the end the other characters was poorly executed and even the supposed hero heroine just didn't do it for me on the plus side the plot is pretty good and the productions values a cut above for these kind of flicks the acting was generally not very good rutger hauer stands out in a small role but it all fails with bland and braindead characters you just stop caring about them after 10 minutes 4 10 and thats being generous,0
this movie introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first half hour or so none of them generate any interest or positive response i waited for the intrigue to begin hoping things would get better and ended up sticking around until the bitter end but there was no reward for doing that br br if you want a synopsis look elsewhere to me the action isn't worth recounting not that the story was that bad i guess you could say i had some problems with the script i e i thought it stunk a look at the credits will show you that there's a pretty strong cast here used to no avail most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs of the actors i hadn't seen much of before i especially liked deborah kara unger that's about all that i can find good to say about this picture,0
i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site i would have to say it was worth the effort however you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes if you don't have the staying power get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights br br now to the film what i say will contain spoilers and if you don't mind here goes br br alexandre is a promiscuous bum a womanizer and a gigolo he lives with an older woman called marie marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her at this point alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else br br by chance alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past marie and veronika struggles for alex's affection and had a ménage à trois to boot finally at the end it's revealed veronika is pregnant with alex's child and alex asked her to marry him we assume as aforesaid with gilberte's situation alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family there is hope br br with the title of la maman et la putain i deduce jean eustache was relating to françoise lebrun's character of veronika she was a whore and then she became the mother hence the mother and whore is the same person anyway what do i know french films are mostly not all very chatty aimlessly political preaching theatrical insipid lamenting and full of quotes lebrun and léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed br br not a bad effort 7 10,1
this movie makes several mistakes a few american actors in spain and the spanish actors speaking english the 'spaniards' english is ok but the way the acting is performed it makes it all quite annoying the dialog through the whole script is very weak it may have been a spanish script but translated incorrectly who knows and who cares i can only assume that these are famous spanish actors forced into the english language they may be good but not in this flop you will figure out the movie within the first 5 minutes thats how pathetic it is then the rest is just bad lots of waste of time lots of un necessary plots oh did i mention one of the baldwins' is in this,0
one of the joys of picking up the recent bela lugosi collection is getting to see delightful movies like the invisible ray boris karloff and bela lugosi team up in a movie that delves into meteorites and radiation and while the science is all perfectly absurd especially the camera technique karloff as janos rukh uses to determine the site of a certain meteorite and downright laughable i didn't care in the lease because the movie is thoroughly enjoyable the effects are done well for the time the acting is great and the finish is particularly strong it reminds me of the pulp sci fi comics and novels of the 1940s and '50s complete with ray guns and ridiculous science you must watch this movie,1
first off anyone who thinks this sequel to william friedkin's the french connection is superior is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both the problem with reviewing this film is that a it's a sequel to a brilliant movie which always makes watching it objectively difficult and b it's directed by john frankenhimer one of the best american directors ever so i wanted to like it william friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film about drug traffic in decaying new york city because of his documentary like approach to the action and story frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish directors ever i e the manchurian candidate and seconds and with his french connection 2 it feels like someone trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off that fact that frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel by gene hackman himself really tells a lot about hackman's understanding about the original film too it's well known hackman hated friedkin on the set and vowed to never work with him again it's also known he envisioned the character to be more one dimensional loosing weight and trying to play him like a straight character it shows you hackman despite being a great actor had no idea who to make the movie and the story great the plot point of doyle becoming an addict is interesting but doesn't warrant the rest of the film an unfortunate low point in frankenhimer's filmography,0
there has never been anything like it that's for sure this episodic seemingly redundant trilogy only really makes sense taken as a whole and as such it is not a movie about groovin' gary utah cross dressing sensation it is very self consciously a film about how the filmmaker reacts to groovin' gary for harris the entire project is clearly an extended and spectacular contortion of guilt and repentance he's trying to atone for his sins yes gary did attempt suicide after the initial doc was aired through correction commentary and convention reclaiming such hollywood narrative standbys as the best friend and the defiant happy ending two different ones with a telling adjustment in the glover version and turning them to his own very personal uses so while thematically it remains a movie about gender and difference the structure ensures that it is also a movie about movies but on an almost unprecedented level of complexity there is just so much going on in telling and re telling this story harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row and he doesn't miss the opportunity to make something of it immensely moving and as profound as camp ever gets,1
beautiful film pure cassavetes style gena rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress dealing with success aging loneliness and alcoholism she tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts embodied by the death spectre of a young girl acceptance of oneself of human condition though its overall difficulties is the real purpose of the film the parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling it's like if the stage became a way out for the heroin if all american movies could only be that top quality dealing with human relations on an adult level not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings one of the best dramas ever 10 10,1
this is one of the funniest shows i have ever seen it is really refreshing to watch and i was in stitches many times i guess there is a social awareness factor to this too which makes it quite interesting if these were white girls would they get the same reaction maybe they would maybe they wouldn't the characters know no limits check my lyrics and do not exclude anyone from their twisted sense of fun there are so many funny sketches my favorites is the bob the builder one it's so silly it's genius if you like twisted black comedy then this is for you if you like keeping up appearances it probably isn't 3 non blonde's is yet another hilarious british bbc comedy shown on tv it is such a funny show and the characters unleashed on the unsuspecting public are laugh at loud funny it would be impossible to keep a straight face watching the crazy characters and the reactions of the public this series easily adds to the excellent comedies being produced,1
just saw this movie on tv and i have to admit i was a bit surprised it was even on there were so many goofs mess ups and bad editing that an old episode of sesame street would have been better to watch the acting was ok but please you can really feel the straight to video feeling the cast crew made this movie a bad melodrama yes there is a message in the movie but just wait until ten minutes before the ending to hear it trust me you wouldn't even tell the difference,0
what is it with americans and their hang up with religious gobbledy gook to think this was a best selling novel is incredible but to pull it off as a movie you really need good acting and a script that delivers in this case all the good actors have gone to heaven and we're left with kirk cameron as a cnn type journalist trying to discover why a lot of people have simply disappeared oh yeah there's a subplot about an evil world conspiracy and famine or something the good news is that this is done so cheaply and with such inane dialogue that it has sheer entertainment value in all of its unintended laughs not recommended for anyone with a 3 digit iq,0
easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays it has been seriously let down here shoddy direction stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy br br in the town of verona the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo patrick rycart a montague falls in love with juliet rebecca saire a capulet bloodshed soon erupts br br the studio work especially in daytime scenes seriously stagnates the energy of the play it's a story that with it's energy deserves to be shot outdoors coupled with this the costumes are hideous with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces the stage fighting looks horrendous with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging br br patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo he manages the character's intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland often inexpressive eyes limit his range it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet she captures the character's naiveté but a little more sassiness would have been welcome br br the supporting roles don't fare much better joseph o'connor's friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut anthony andrews' mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result alan rickman underplaying his role has virtually no presence as tybalt he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years but that isn't in evidence here the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera only micheal hordern in probably his best role in this series comes out of this with any dignity his capulet is well played and a joy to watch br br see one of the other versions of this story instead,0
like many here i grew up with scooby doo unlike many here who did i love this show i think that it has been very well done and thought through everything about it marks it as a spin off which isn't meant to be taken seriously the formula is simple it is a parody of other cartoons with a single bad guy trying to get the better of the good guy by using the well known shaggy and scooby doo characters it is much easier to engage the viewer with the parody humour from the outset of each 30 minute episode br br there have always been scooby doo spin offs which have annoyed fans the classic being the scooby shaggy scrappy shorts from the 80's these spin offs had their place they allowed new content to be sold created new fans and kept scooby doo merchandise on the shelves i would agree that shaggy scooby doo get a clue doesn't fit in with this traditional role but it is probably what i had always wanted the scooby shaggy scrappy shorts to be an action packed show which focuses on the best funniest scooby doo characters good features of the show the animation the voices the attention to detail the bad guys the best friend relationship between shaggy and scooby doo the constant humour bad features none although the revamped mystery machine is pretty close at times br br well done warner bros animation one of the cleverest cartoons in a long time,1
shut it off the prologue with fu manchu's birthday and the opening credits of the assassins training is amusing then it drops off faster than hair sprayed with neat look for a cameo by cato in the beginning with a figurative wink at the audience,0
in micro phonies the stooges are at there best in this short the trio are handymen working in a recording studio they end up getting a look at alice van doren christine mcintyre singing the voice of spring the voice is amazing curly in drags is heard by mrs bixby symona boniface moe calls curly senior cucaracha the three stooges end up going to party where curly is going to dress up in drags they play a record of the voices of spring and all is going well until moe destroy the record on curly's head they end up using the lucia sexlet until the baritone recognizes them and unplugs it alice van doren catches on to the boy scream and hides behind a curtain to help them out all is well until the baritone wonders how curly is singing without the aid of a phonograph discovers alice behind the curtain the three stooges are revealed to be frauds but alice's father discovers his daughter's talent and agrees that she should become a singer the stooge are pelted out of the room excellent,1
sundown the vampire in retreat is a rubbish the acting is terrible the atmosphere is non existent and the characters are uninteresting the only scary thing about this piece of scum is that majority of the imdb users gave it a 10 this is really horrifying no gore no suspense no violence nothing bruce cambell the evil dead intruder is completely wasted the supporting cast is also terrible yes some people may like this picture especially a mainstream society but hard core horror fans or gore hounds won't enjoy this piece of crap personally i hate horror comedies i prefer watching serious horror movies like cannibal holocaust or last house on the left in my opinion a real horror movie is supposed to be scary excessively bloody and disturbing without stupid humour which usually ruins the whole concept this one isn't scary isn't gory isn't even funny as a comedy so don't waste your precious time,0
in our household like everyone else who has commented on this movie my brothers 7 4 years old at the time and i 10 would watch this movie over and over again we all loved star wars but we always went back to this one because of the great songs and the adventure we all loved the camel and would sing at the top of our lungs with him during his song there are some slow moments the time spent with king koo koo in his court and we generally got bored after the knight's song the reason that i sound effect is because i loooooove you but we loved the journey to rescue babbette and the ending and were all a little freaked out by the picture of king koo koo floating there dominating the entire horizon laughing maniacally at the end i still to this day sing hooray for me babbette of gay paris around my friends i'm 33 now who just look at me as if i've lost my mind however when i'm singing it i'm 10 years old again remembering the wonderful year of star wars,1
well i watched this last night and the one thing that didn't make it completely terrible is that it was straight forward there was no beating around the bush that this kid was the anti christ however the movie was just poorly written for example they never explained how they made the dentist incident an accident or at the end how the cop just miraculously ended up at the house in time to save the kid without the police even being called yet the death scenes were just really bad and not entertaining at all the kid they chose to play the anti christ was boring and they really could've picked a better kid just don't waste your time watching this,0
following the success of the awful gilligan's island tv movie reruns a number of tv movies were made in the 1980's reuniting casts from classic shows most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humor that made the shows so special the munsters revenge is among the most disappointing because it goes for a laurel and hardy type comedy style that really wasn't in the original series yvonne de carlo a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series is completely wasted she has less time here in this 90 minute movie than she did in any single 30 minute episode and since the roles of eddie and marilyn in this movie are nothing more than cameos what was the point of making them younger and recasting them with very little rewriting they could have used butch patrick and pat priest although seeing some of the munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch i didn't enjoy sid caesar as the hammy mad scientist mainly because there's too much of him and not enough of the underused munsters ironically that very year 1981 caesar's old partner in comedy imogene coca was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a tv movie reunion return of the beverly hillbillies another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the munster family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a typical if strange american family not famous monsters this was the last munsters project featuring the original cast in their roles there was an awful revival of the series in the late 1980's with a completely new cast and a 1990's tv movie which featured decarlo lewis priest and patrick in cameo roles as a family dining,0
boris and bela do well together in this film whether they are against each other or paddling the same boat i saw this one in 1972 and just purchased it from borders this year this time watching it with my children i took note of 2 things it held the attention of a 3 4 and 5 year old and i caught a few things i hadn't when i first watched it very swift story with an unpredictable end a must for movie buffs,1
this movie is such a moving amazing piece of work i saw it at the theater when it came out but i was only 13 didn't really quite get it i saw it again when i was 20 on video of course i now own it was just blown away steven spielberg created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end i have read the book as well but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life the casting acting music costuming scenery everything it just wonderful you laugh you cry you cheer it brings out every emotion imaginable it is one of his finest pieces of work should not be missed,1
this film is mediocre at best angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers her bitchy demeanor from law and order carries over in a failed attempt at comedy charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti comedy the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denise's marriage hopefully that effort produces better results,0
kevin spacey is very talented but unfortunately directing is not his forte i had high expectations about the film before i rented it and maybe that is why i disliked it so much i admire spacey's attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting but it's not the attempt that counts i found the film dull boring and stretched out the acting was nothing spectacular gary sinise has done much better especially since he is conscious in most of his other films skeet ulrich was disappointing but this was one of his first films i did get a kick out of how young and chubby this scream star looked the only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above the center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck however that shot was very usual suspects ish and my guess is spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his which is very good mind you if you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting watch hitchcock's lifeboat maybe spacey should have watched it before filming this,0
a young boy sees his mother getting killed and his father hanging himself 20 years later he gets a bunch of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself so he won't turn out like his father all the stock characters are in place the nice couple the funny guy the tough but sensitive hood the smart girl she wears glasses that's how we know the nerd and two no personality blondes it all involves some stupid wooden statue that comes to life don't ask and kills people i knew i was in trouble when after a great opening scene we jump to 20 years later all bad horror movies do that br br the dialogue is atrocious the acting is bad except for betsy palmer why betsy and the killings are stupid and or unimaginative my favorite scene is when two people are supposedly having sex and the statue knocks the guy off the bed to show he's fully dressed a real bad stupid incoherent horror film avoid at all costs,0
personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies such as this treasured little gem way back in the eighties the early eighties i discovered this movie like so many released at the time night patrol bad manners or even king frat the artwork and blurbs on the back of the covers tempted and teased you br br of course being of an age movies like that i have already mentioned as well as stuff like screwballs and the many others captured the imagination and thankfully many years later i still remember some with fondness and some with disdain the many movies that help maintain my love of such genre as parodies or pastiches br br made many years after the huge success of animal house and having seen how it had fared down through the years i now know that there would be no way this movie would ever eclipse the box office bucks obtain aforementioned nor would it linger in the memory much like that of national lampoon's vacation br br to be honest not everything that has carried the national lampoon logo has been a wild success however to me class reunion remains one of my all time favourite movies with instantly recognisable characters such as the aloof bob spinnaker played to perfection by gerrit graham so good in charles band's terrorvision still lingering in the past glories of his youth or how about stephen furst's brash and ballsy turn as the high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum hubert downs br br sweet as which makes me ponder as i already said personal taste not withstanding people can be so cruel so it will never win any awards or be compared to the like of its's peers within the comedy world it does have some merit being one of the earlier scripts penned by john hughes who would later go on to do one of my own favourites of his work weird science as well as having a wonderful theme title sung by the great gary u s bonds br br what more can i say it's a movie just waiting to be rediscovered time and time again,1
i had the privilege of watching holly at the edinburgh film festival last week what a powerful and moving story holly is a 12 yr old vietnamese girl who is sold into prostitution by her own family and living in a brothel in cambodia patrick an american comes into holly's life and decides he wants to help her when holly is sold again patrick desperately searches for her we follow they're difficult journey through cambodia and hope for their reunion br br holly is one of millions of children who are sold and trafficked every day the movie portrays this difficult issue without crossing the line i walked away wanting to know more about the issue of child trafficking and asking how can i help this movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it exposes an issue that we should no longer ignore,1
oh yeah jenna jameson did it again yeah baby this movie rocks it was one of the 1st movies i saw of her and i have to say i feel in love with her she was great in this move br br her performance was outstanding and what i liked the most was the scenery and the wardrobe it was amazing you can tell that they put a lot into the movie the girls cloth were amazing br br i hope this comment helps and u can buy the movie the storyline is awesome is very unique and i'm sure u are going to like it jenna amazed us once more and no wonder the movie won so many awards her make up and wardrobe is very very sexy and the girls on girls scene is amazing specially the one where she looks like an angel it's a must see and i hope u share my interests,1

warning spoilers ahead br br this short is part one of two that expound upon the brief portion of the matrix in which morpheus explains how the matrix came to be because we already know the story the plot itself is no surprise and the short isn't so much entertaining as informative but that's how it is presented as a file in the historical archives the visuals are better than average and the generally cold colors aid the purpose of the short br br a couple problems the violence of the tale is a little gratuitous and combined with the occasional dose of political correctness un scenes detracts from the straight narrative of the short plus it needs to be seen with part two to be complete br br the animatrix concept is brilliant and despite a few issues this short still fulfills its purpose it would not have fit in the original movie in style content or flow this is the perfect method to reveal the history br br bottom line good information could have been told a little better but still a solid 7 of 10,1
this is the biggest piece of lamo i've ever watched it is excruciatingly boring i would have rather sat through a seminar on creationism than have watched this if i had known it was going to be as boring as it was not even the 40 seconds of the hot chick in the bikini with the big ta tas redeems this of anything lower than a 1 br br the reviews of this movie claiming that this movie is unintentionally funny are absurd and just plain wrong not one thing is funny about this movie they spend the first 50 or so minutes walking through the woods talking about stuff you wouldn't understand nor care about and it is just as lame when the people start dying because you don't even know who the people are because they are so uninteresting honestly though i didn't watch it to the ending but that should say something about how horrible it is worst movie ever br br immediately after ejecting this filth from my dvd player i started scraping it against the cement in front of my house not wanting other blockbuster customers to have to fall upon the same mistake i had made as to rent this movie then zach peed his pants thankyou for your time,0
the man in the moon is a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a farming family in the 1950's the main story follows a 14 year old girl reese witherspoon who develops a crush on a 17 year old neighbor jason london who ends up falling for her older sister emily warfield and how an unexpected tragedy alters this family's dynamics forever the 1950's are lovingly evoked here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately witherspoon already begins to show the oscar winning talent she would develop in this early role and london makes a charming leading man warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well kudos to sam waterston and tess harper who play the girls' parents and gail strickland who plays london's mom i was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase family ties,1
in a lot of his films citizen kane confidential report touch of evil orson welles gave him the role of an exuberant men in the lady from shanghai it's the only time i see him holding the role of the victim the role of the culprit he gave it to rita hayworth i guess it's because he was in love with her therefore it's an interesting film but i find the story excellent too the direction is genius as usual with welles two scenes are particularly brilliant the one in the aquarium and the final one with the mirrors this film is brilliant 10 10,1
when my 14 year old daughter and her friends get together for movie night there's one movie they insist on watching over and over again you guessed it k 911 the third installment in the highly successful k 9 franchise starring everybody's favorite tv dad jim belushi br br folks i knew it was possible to wear out a vhs tape but a dvd this has been played so often that it's starting to skip no joke but of course you'll have that when you own a film so charming so brilliant br br of course we have to thank the one and only tom hanks for introducing us to the beloved cop dog genre with turner and hooch however even that film doesn't measure up to the sheer excellence presented in all three k 9 movies br br some nay sayers say belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series poppycock i say while you might suspect that a third installment direct to video at that may not seem like something worth watching you'd prove yourself wrong after watching this quality movie br br i won't give away the plot but i will say that belushi and his panting partner give their best performance yet one that will have you howling with laughter it's a shame john belushi isn't alive to see what great strides his brother has made in the acting world br br i highly recommend your teenage daughter introduces this film to her bffs at her next slumber party don't forget the puppy chow,1
after you see vertigo then watch bell book and candle made within months of each other br br my second favorite kim novak film with picnic coming in as third br br all three performances are great vertigo being the best of all br br they came to my nowhere kansas prairie town near by at salina kansas in the 50s to film picnic br br bell book and candle's musical score i believe is one of alex north's perfect for this bit of comedy br br after vertigo stewart and novak did this comedy how amusing to note the dramatic contrast br br worth your time if you like kim novak the greta garbo of my youth,1
this movie is visually stunning who cares if she can act or not each scene is a work of art composed and captured by john derek the locations set designs and costumes function perfectly to convey what is found in a love story comprised of beauty youth and wealth in some ways i would like to see this movie as a tribute to john and bo derek's story and this commentary would not be complete without mentioning anthony quinn's role as father mentor lover and his portrayal of a man of men lost to a bygone era when men were men there are some of us who find value in strength and direction wrapped in a confidence that contributes to a sense of confidence containment and security yes they do not make men like that anymore but then how often do you find women who are made like bo derek,1
even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the 1960s ok so katie didn't join the manson family and nobody died at altamont this movie was still unbelievably awful i got the impression that the writers just locked themselves in a room and watched forrest gump the wonder years and oliver stone's 60s films over and over again and called it research a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode head spinning he was right,0
the leap years stars some heavy hitters in the local and regional film and television scene and yet they cannot save this movie it has so many things going against it over acting overly melodramatic poor script inconsistent direction and too few things going for it decent music good cinematography this comment is mainly for anyone who throws all local movies into one basket after watching this film and says all local movies are bad please do not judge the rest based on this one film this is a television soap opera masquerading as a romantic feature film my hopes were high when i bought my ticket and my hopes were dashed five minutes into the film,0
whoever gave this movie rave reviews needs to see more movies br br a loser takes his camera and photographs his mental family the movie is filled with idiots and includes live teabagging that should sum it all up for you br br do not waste your time you may want to watch the entire movie in the hopes that it gets better as it goes on it doesn't,0
here's a review for people like me this movie sucks from beginning to end i threw popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining myself a la msf2000 the plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart the lead falls for a con man and it doesn't occur to her that she might get conned and she's rich and she's a famous psychologist come on people she enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her that was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half witted movie viewers rain man would have been insulted i also admit that i despise mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat eaters war starters and fur wearers my hatred is so complete that it defies logic but i'll give it a shot that it's not supposed to sound real is fine i don't care it's that everyone talks the same mamet can't create characters all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actors no wonder his actors are so wooden they're confused about everyone being the same character however his later films do improve,0
me my boyfriend and our friend watched this movie if thats what u wanna call it and we agree with the last person but we were stupid and bought the damn thing we thought it really was about diablo so we bought it br br we hate it really suxz so beware do not buy this thing they call a movie br br we would return it but don't no if anybody would want this stupid movie br br oh and another thing the shouldn't call it the legend of diablo they should of called it legend of azar br br and this movie is rated r this should not of even been not rated br br we think that diablo would be crying his eyes out laughing at this stupid movie br br this is a movie that would have been done by a church br br theses actors are never gonna become nothing because this movie,0
some things need to be clarified the picture of mark ferris is not the mark ferris who starred in this movie i know that because he was my dad please remove that picture also mark ferris was the writer at least one of them i have been trying to find a copy or a way to see this movie again it has been years and if someone can point me in the direction of obtaining a copy that would be great the movie wasn't all that bad and trying to compare it to todays world of star wars and other high tech sci fi's it futile if you watch it just enjoy it for the rediculousness and humor it possesses lighten up on being movie snobs and enjoy some less creative and innovated films,0
this movie is about development people growing and people fading people surprising and people disappointing it has it all and more there is hope frustration injustice justice love and hate it is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially whoopi goldberg in her debut role br br this movie made me feel very human and proud of it and i suggest that this movie should be mandatory each saturday in all prisons in the world it touches your compassion rating 10 of 10 br br ps i admit it i shed a tear of joy during the final scene,1
not a bad word to say about this film really i wasn't initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly i like it a lot and i think its a shame that many people can't see past the fact that it was banned in some territories mine being one of them the film delivers in the shock gore and atmosphere department the score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivering apparatus it only seems fair that chris young went on to be one of the best composers in the business the acting in this film is of a somewhat high standard if a little wooden in some spots and the effects are very real and gritty all of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book i've noted in some reviews that the film has gotten serious flack having the famous killer's p o v shot and i ask what's wrong with that it is a classic shot that evokes dread into any good fan of the genre and is a great to keep the killer's identity a secret the only thing that stops this film getting top marks in my book is that the surprise twist killer revealed is not handled with more care i mean it just happens kind of quickly though the great performances make it just about credible aside from that pranks is a great movie though i prefer the original title and its a shame that so many people knock it off as just a cheap piece of crap its more than that but only few know that as it seems to have gotten lost in the haze of early 80s slasher what a shame its a really good movie people believe me,1
if your idea of a thriller is car chases explosions and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire then house of games is definitely not the movie for you if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense then by all means see it br br house of games tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer dr margaret ford lindsay crouse who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike joe mantegna to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense frankly i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming just like a clever con artist this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance br br the story is taut and well crafted the dialogue smart and laconic the acting uniformly good mantegna is superbly charismatic some have complained that dr ford is not a very sympathetic character and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive but dr ford is supposed to be cold and aloof moreover her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot at one point i believe that an injury to her sexual self esteem is a key part of her motivation i'll say no more br br house of games is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity it will hold your attention every second while you are watching and stay with you for a long time afterwards,1
i went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned alice entertainment once i realized i would not be getting that i watched it for a pretty well made movie in terms of filming and yeah that was it but aside from it having a good film quality considering i had been watching grainy movies all day long there was nothing good about that movie br br he killed 42 why were tweedle dee and dum played by mudler and scully serisouly who can answer that for me who can answer anything awful about this movie for me br br i agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the staff that's all it seemed to be br br poor mr carroll i'm so sorry somebody did that to his wonderful tales,0
was so that i could in good conscience tell everyone how horrible this movie is i barely made it through twenty minutes before i started thinking to myself wow this is pretty bad and to be honest i would've given this movie 1 star if it wasn't for esai morales though he had very little screen time he's the movie's only well acted role which is a shame because i really like gil bellows or at least i thought i did br br while watching this i started thinking back to his part in shawshank redemption and realized it wasn't as good as i thought it was problem his jail house tough guy act seems like it's just that an act his dialogue sounded like he was doing a very poor impression has he ever met someone who speaks like his character was supposed to i doubt it but maybe he should have br br and to make matters worse they've managed to inject a little jail house philosophy and make it seem nothing short of contrived especially when you consider that the rhetoric was being spouted by a rasta who's accent was so strong that it seemed unnatural br br i wouldn't normally slam a movie like this but when i saw the movie it had a fairly favorable review i felt like i was cheated and lied to and i thought i should try to save someone the misery of having to watch this movie br br i say boooooooo,0
this is a fair little show about the paranormal although it feels as if art bell and his ilk figured out how to carve a career out of the attitude that carl kolchak exemplified of course there probably wouldn't be an x files if this show hadn't prepped this audience for it so well darren mcgavin is not exactly the super heroic type but he is a plausible enough guy to deliver heroic deeds check out his work on some of those old alfred hitchcock presents here he is the main attraction there doesn't seem to be a girlfriend or wife who's a distraction in fact there isn't a whole lot of sex appeal to the show something i'm noticing as well is that the pacing isn't really suspenseful in a typical way there's a lot of throwaway humor to this show sometimes its just pokey to get to the climax there's a thread from this show coming all the way up to the present mad men show in terms of style not that david chase writes mad men but the people that worked under him on the sopranos definitely have emulated and inherited his serio comic tone,0
in this 1943 film judy garland is deemed not to be ready for the big time yet by the man who loves her van heflin this film was certainly a big change for mr heflin especially after his supporting oscar win the year before in johnny eager br br wasn't spring byington too old to be the widowed mother of 5 children with four of them appearing to look like her grandchildren br br the singing and dancing are just marvelously staged but the way that the blossoming romance between heflin and garland was depicted left a lot to be desired it was a gigi like one where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a charmer,1
when you get your hands on a british film you expect some sort of quality and when it comes to acting camera work lighting etc this film does the business it's done by highly skilled craftsmen that alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours but when you look under the layers of professionalism you don't really find anything apart from making you feel good and advocate a drug liberal view there's really nothing there the script is mediocre the plot is predictable and the ending must be one of the worst east of hollywood in all it's english cosiness it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another full monty why they made this film i haven't got a clue apart from making money of course,0
i just saw the movie on tv i really enjoyed it i like a good mystery and this one had me guessing up to the end sean connery did a good job i would recomend it to a friend,1
probably the worst dolph film ever there's nothing you'd want or expect here don't waste your time dolph plays a miserable cop with no interests in life his brother gets killed and dolph tries to figure things out the character is just plain stupid and stumbles around aimlessly pointless,0
if you like mech war games it's pretty good some of it is cheap but the robot fights is worth seeing i've enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie i've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs if you like the genera then games you like are mech warrior three and four and if you have an xbox and 350 to spare steel battalion the movie is worth seeing at least once there really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there less remakes and more original works br br enjoy,1
the 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke out about their views racial tensions politics the vietnam war sexual promiscuity and drug use were all part of the daily fabric and the daily news this film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie and largely succeeded br br in this film two families are followed one white one black during the first half of the film the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles unfortunately the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family admittedly there are more characters in this family and the story lines are intermingled but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century br br on the whole the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie the movie is a work of fiction but clips of well known historical figures are used to set the time line br br i enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one sided,0
i cannot believe that this movie was ever created i think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse the zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup the zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes finally there are maybe five or six zombies total definitely not a nation the best part of the movie if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished again to reiterate other user comments the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie also there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all it is never explained,0
i had never heard of this film prior to seeing it i wondered if it was an independent film and i was correct but with a good cast i decided to chance it basically drifter michael williams nicolas cage is in the town red rock wyoming looking for a job and meeting bar owner wayne brown pleasantville's j t walsh he is given a large sum of money mistaken for a hit man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife suzanne lara flynn boyle he does not correct him takes the money and goes to warn suzanne and after she makes him a counteroffer he decides he needs to leave when wayne knows his real identity he chases michael shooting a big gun until he gets in a car with lyle from dallas dennis hopper but things get complicated when michael realises lyle is the hit man he was mistaken for and he makes a quick retreat he goes back to suzanne and knowing they are both in danger they plan to leave town together and add another complication by falling for each other before they leave however suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe of course things aren't going to go smoothly and wayne and lyle catch up to them and lyle forces them and now tied up wayne to go and get the buried money in the end lyle and wayne both get what they deserve michael and suzanne do get on a moving train together but it is obvious she cares more about the money and she gets what she deserves too also starring craig reay as jim vance johnson as mr johnson timothy carhart as deputy matt greytack dwight yoakam as truck driver and robert apel as howard the performances apart from maybe a lame boyle are all fine and dandy and it has got quite a good film noir feel for a black comedy thriller very good,1
ok the helicopter shots are fantastic and the director made good use of some of barcelona's top sights otherwise production value was blown in the first few minutes and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week ellen pompeo was charming and fun to watch abel folk had the most depth and was very effective and william baldwin was well william baldwin he got to put his martial art training to good use and be a running jumping earnest action figure the rest of the cast was wooden at best but mostly paper so if you're nostalgic about spain it's a picture postcard with an action twist and a healthy dose of el greco if not skip it,0
this is a brilliant political satire no wonder why it was largely ignored in the u s it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is br br another good film from this era rendition was also totally dismissed simply because it showed accurately that the u s is a war machine bent on torturing murdering and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination br br a clever plot good acting some big stars john cusack ben kingsley marisa tomei anyone and some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a hit unfortunately americans don't like to hear the truth about themselves especially when they are complicit in mass murder,1
a strong pilot this two hour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for enterprise the prequel to the original star trek series it stumbles a few times into trek convention and cliché candy colored space strippers never seem to go out of style and i can already foresee snickering references to t'pol as seven of vulcan but the ensemble looks strong the characters are well drawn and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful in different ways than those of earlier later series scott bakula hits the right note as a captain with kirk's brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger and i look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer weapons master and communications officer not just a glorified phone operator anymore as supporting players the writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in star trek the next generation deep space 9 and voyager instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift it's starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added later which i hope happens because after about a half dozen episodes more variety will be needed,1
so i know that i voted 1 out of 10 but really this deserves no more than half of a star i hated it it was so stupid and unrealistic i can't believe any of the stars signed on to make this ridiculously absurd project br br james g and cathrine o'hara were excellent in their characters and ben affleck and christina applegate were just as good too but the story sucked and i encourage anyone who sees this in the video store to not even bother picking it up and reading the back cover but to just walk away i don't even want to get into what the movie is about because it is too stupid to pontificate about br br don't rent this it's horrible horrible,0
i liked this movie cute and funny i found this film to be a good family film the dirtiest part of this movie was when it made references to the new york yankees you have to be in red sox nation to understand that ny yankees is a dirty word sorry to say that to the yankee's fans i recommend this picture for the entire family of course with your typical love comedy movie there's a long moment in the movie with i'm in love and what do i do but the movie makes up for that with all the slapstick moments the movie show's some moments of how the red sox nation in fenway park how the fans felt about 86 years of the sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the sox and the love with another human go hand to hand,1
the original movie dated 19 did not show any monster it just suggested scary things br br this version however shows every aspect of a sick minded ghost including unnecessary special effects br br the mystery as presented in the original movie was the most scary part one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened by showing the face of the old man this mister has completely disappeared even worse the special effects crying wooden children faces is ridiculous this is a stupid remake too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original,0
except for jon heder this guy tanked the entire movie br br the plot sounded entertaining a 29 year old slacker son heder still lives with widowed mom keaton who happens to meet a new love daniels slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship he also meets a girl faris br br i really liked the performance of daniels and especially faris but whoever casted hader would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach heders performance is annoying which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale at the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you're upset about the end in the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me,0
i won't give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide it unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life as she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates it leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion the film is expertly paced and the acting especially by talia sharon as ya'ara the blind woman is excellent israeli film has definitely come of age and is now fully competitive with other foreign films though few have found a large audience in the u s,1
surprised to see the rather low score for this movie just saw this film for the first time in 10 years and was reminded why i like it br br come back with me children to a time when michael keaton was a straight up comedy guy and you might find some joy in this film it's a gentle comedy the kind ron howard specializes in but if that's your thing you should check this out keaton's low key charm is just right for this project br br gung ho is a bit dated because it takes places in the last stage of the pre global economy world when it still mattered what country a business was based in that said it delivers laughs as well as a lesson on how people can learn from each other to great benefit br br you could watch this film and enjoy it without remembering one scene in particular you really liked but that's because the whole movie provides a slow but constant stream of laughs it's like an i v drip and i mean that in a good way,1
another reason to watch this delightful movie is florence rice florence who that was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen i soon found out who florence rice was a real beauty who turns in a simply wonderful performance as they all do in this gripping ensemble piece from 1939 its a different time but therein lies the charm it transports you into another world it starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious florence rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine she is absolutely delightful at the same time strong vulnerable evolving from a girl to a woman watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie she made over forty movies and i am going to seek out the other thirty nine alan marshal is of the flynn gable mode and proves a perfect match for florence buddy ebsen and una merkel provide some excellent comic moments but the real star is florence rice fans of 30's 40's movies don't miss this one,1
cunningly interesting western from a director who had few peers in the genre much like other anthony mann pictures the far country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery both of which play out amongst some of mann's peccadilloes like honour integrity betrayal and of course death the story sees fortune hunting partners jeff webster james stewart and ben tatum walter brennan travel to oregon territory with a herd of cattle aware of the blossoming gold boom they plan to make a tidy profit selling the cattle in a klondike town arriving in skagway they find self appointed judge mr gannon john mcintire ready to meet out justice to webster on account of webster having fractured the law all be it with honest cause along the way in punishment gannon takes the partners herd from them but they steal them back and head across the canadian border to dawson with gannon and his men in hot pursuit here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involved br br interesting from start to finish the far country benefits greatly from james stewart's bubbling anti hero in waiting portrayal and mann's slick direction of the tight borden chase script the cinematography from william h daniels is superlative tho not done any favours by current dvd prints and the film has a few surprises and a will he wont he core reeling the viewers in paying dividends on re watches for hardened genre fans it still remains something of an essential viewing for first timers venturing into the wonderful yet dark western world of anthony mann and james stewart 8 10,1
i watched this movie for a project on love please tell nicolas cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character and then re read the lines he's saying my life cannot go on i accidentally cut off my own hand my brother was close by obviously his fault and since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of mom sad and alone no closure bad script and doesn't have enough extension of minor characters save yourself unless your up for a good laugh costumes were done appropriately and extras did a fabulous job i'm sure it would have been a fun movie to make but keep it more genre specific i can't recommend this movie to anyone i know because it is not an intellectual movie it is not a chick flick it is not a strict romantic and i can't show kids because of the sex and questions to follow all in all just not a good flick,0
what an incredible fall for sean ellis br br you gather a bunch of your friends at home all hyped about the follow up work of sean ellis you have an vague idea of the plot no spoilers that could kill the fun very high expectations br br it is late at night perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type br br 15minutes passes and you start telling yourself it is bound to pick up at 25mins you start wondering if you should just go to sleep and save this for another time when you can fully appreciate the expected not existent subtle touches over the half hour mark you realize half of your your hyped up audience is already asleep and call it a day br br a few days later when you exhaust all other material to watch you go back to this in the middle of the day this time hoping your mood will keep you awake this time 10 minutes later you find yourself fastforwarding the unbelievably and needlessly long intermediate transitions and images any other stuff i would have given up already but there is cashback and its legacy but that legacy can only carry you so long this is a new level of boring movie making imagine a short story extended to a novel with just descriptions this is what it is br br decent cast is wasted there is no cinematography that leaves you in awe like cashback either there are films that annoy you there are films that lack certain aspects or just cheesy unfortunately this is just a waste of time br br final words stay away,0
the only reason i am commenting is because i finally figured out why dr cox was bald although we probably all realized it at the same time this week dr cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them the latest episode when our favorite grumpy jesus loving nurse roberts dies dr cox shaves his head the must have showed them out of order for some odd reason and forgot they slipped up the continuity for shame scrubs they've made mistakes like this before i remember when elliot is trying to date scott foley and her hair is wet 2 seconds before water hits her i try not to notice these things but my favorite show needs to step it up,0
along with south pacific guys and dolls is for grown ups it is sassy sexy and full of men being men and women being strung along br br there is an energy and drive that makes this stand out from the pack the strength of jean simmond's performance and the charm of a young brando and an already masterful sinatra add much to the overall feel and look of the piece br br guys and dolls wins as it is unashamedly what it is an mgm musical br br still good to look at and listen too with great tunes and dance numbers it will remain one of the classics of 20th century cinema and be watched with pleasure for years to come br br warmly recommended,1
awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed battlestar titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick b o r i n g br br find something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your tv with no picture and no sound 1 10 i rated it so high b c there aren't any negative scores in the imdb com rating system br br zaphoid br br ps my theory about star power is the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is it's called an indirect proportionality quality 1 star power less sp makes for better quality etc another way to look at it is more is less br br z,0
considering the risk of showing same sex relationships before the late 1980's personal best could have done better to play the same sex relationship between hemingway chris cahill and donnelly tory skinner as a more than experimental phase of cahill's life br br it seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the same sex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole this random scene had very little relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie i suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie the 1980 oregon track and field competition br br this review may seem harsh but it is the truth the exploitation of young muriel hemingway's body and the same sex relationship ruined any credit that i would have given to this film br br pepper thompson,0
with this topic it is so easy to take cheap shots you know the guy with hairy legs trying to look like marilyn monroe not here adrian pasdar does a superb job of making gerald a real person someone you care deeply about and as a result you feel for his plight trying to live both as gerald and geraldine not only that but as geraldine he looks hot and the chemistry between him and julie walters is electric these are two characters who feel love for one another and it comes through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table even the potentially cheesy sub story line of corporate takeovers is believable and you find yourself cheering at the end at least i did,1
this film had no huge stars in it but did have a very good cast filled with excellent supporting actors and gene tierney before she became a big star with george sanders reginald gardner harry carey bruce cabot jospeh calleia and cederic hardwicke you'd expect more from the film than it actually delivered most of this i suspect is because of a second rate script as director henry hathaway was a competent and well established man at the helm br br the film is set in east africa during wwii just before the americans entered the war the brits are trying to control their african colonies while subversive nazi elements are trying to stir up trouble among the locals one of the white men in the film is a double dealer working for the destruction of the british empire but lovely tierney playing a sultan's daughter is out to help save the day for good ol' britain br br american film makers have long sided with the empire and the 1930s and 40s saw a plethora of pro empire films nowadays with changed sensibilities the notion of seeing the happy black natives dying for queen and country seems ridiculous and it would be hard to root for either side still in its day this propaganda piece was effective in drumming up support for the british though when seen today the film suffers from a long winded script and silly casting the one bright moment in the film is the final showdown between george sanders and the enemy agent too bad after such a potent scene the film just seemed to talk and talk losing some of its punch,0
if you need cheering up on a cold weekday evening this is the film for you excellent script and perfectly cast actors i especially loved ray psyching himself up in front of the mirror before gigs inspired,1
brilliant over acting by lesley ann warren best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none the corn on face is a classic as good as anything in blazing saddles the take on lawyers is also superb after being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently i'm a lawyer he says three funny words jeffrey tambor a favorite from the later larry sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto his character is more malevolent than usual the hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all time classics look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting one bleeds this movie gets better each time i see it which is quite often,1
for a comedy this has a decent and inventive plot and trey parker and matt stone's comic timing is perfect there are dozens of funny moments to this fantastic movie i especially like the multitude of colors and the way the clash in the sports arena scenes robert stacks unsolved mysteries spoof is also very amusing,1
i was never so bored in my life hours of pretentious self obsessed heroin addicted basket cases lounging around whining about their problems it's like watching lizards molt even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy if you have insomnia rent this,0
jiøí trnka made his last animated short an indictment of totalitarism which caused him trouble in his native czechoslovakia the elements are few the symbolisms simple and his trademark ornaments almost absent here allowing the viewer to concentrate on the fable a man in his room dedicates to pottery and to take care of his only plant but suddenly a huge hand enters the room and orders him to make a statue of itself the man refuses and he's persecuted by the ominous gloved hand in these days where the impression of reality factor seems to be erased from most animations that try to replace the real world it is refreshing to watch a film which makes its technique part of the enjoyment,1
you might be tempted to rent this film because peter sellers appears in it that would be a mistake this is one of the most pointless films ever made i kept waiting for something funny to happen but nothing funny appears in this movie even the film industry recognized this was a very weak film and didn't even try to promote it its a wonder that it was ever put on video br br i wonder what sort of contract caused sellers to be in this film i also wonder why the people responsible for this film were allowed to go on to make other bad films surely this film is a waste of the money used to create it and a waste of anyone's time watching it surely there are high school students who would be able to write produce a film which as a plot,0
i couldn't believe it when i put this movie in my dvd player i thought i'd have a good laugh since i've played d d for half my life i had to turn it off as i had company and they were wondering what the crap i was watching br br finished it later and i should have just left it off at the soft core gay clown porn in the beginning no they run the gamut of fart jokes cum jokes incest racism dressing up as kkk this movie is flat out mean to anyone who's ever played d d br br no wonder it looks like the real d d wouldn't let them use their game who'd want their name attached to this,0
this hong kong filmed potboiler packs in more melodrama than week's worth of 'the young the restless' this one is more of a throwback to the original 'emmanuelle' trilogy especially 'goodbye emmanuelle' than a d'amato sleazefest chai lee emy wong undergoes a stunning transformation from dour nurse to hot to trot streetwalker future italian porn star politician illona staller who would later go by the name ciccolina and have sex with an hiv positive john holmes plays emy's competition exotic locales and some decent soft core scenes round this one out recommended for fans of the original 'emmanuelle' of which i am one,1
you do realize that you've been watching the exact same show for eight years right i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co exist on an island but you'd think that after watching unkempt stink ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interesting br br and i'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable it's just hard to suspend disbelief for bushy bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make shift bio dome sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy br br what's the appeal here i don't care about these people or their meandering lives i just don't get it but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy unwashed people i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat they call them homeless people and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters eventually striking pay dirt and fashioning a homemade dr frankenstein styled cancer stick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of aqua velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise and the best part much like survivor every week one member of the tribe leaves the island when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full blown schizophrenia kicks into gear now that's entertainment,0
i rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable judge for yourself be warned the following will not only give away the plot but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie br br a computer virus designed by a frustrated nerd sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors when the code in the form of light enters the eye it can access the 'electrical system' of your body what it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck develops tunnel vision his skin will turn white of the calcium after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk br br this virus is very intelligent when it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device operated by hands the device is set on a very high voltage which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the expert's head the virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an atm fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pc's in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water br br oh dear,0
the only reason i even watched this was because i found it at my local library and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it and despite the plethora of tits and ass it didn't take long to realize that the fast forward button was my friend terrible direction pedestrian camera work sporadically bad to nearly passable acting chintzy effects and one of the worst screenplays i've had the displeasure of seeing brought to life such as it was horribly crippled and mutilated in a long long time best laughs actually come from the making of featurette in which the poor saps involved with this hdv mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special instead of something that won't be utterly forgotten next week wait except for the fact that somehow someone lured tippi the birds hedren of all people into doing a bit part along with kane friday the 13th hodder how this came to pass i'll never know and to be honest i don't really care watch at your own risk and don't say you haven't been warned this is film making at its pretentious craven worst it only gets a 2 from me for having some good looking naked women and even then just barely,0
this film has its share of negative comments and i have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made true most of the films based on the works of king are pretty bad but this one goes beyond bad into the realm of horrible there is not one scary moment in it unless you consider stupidity scary it is typical king garbage myths twisted around that made no sense in the first place mixed with obvious and belabored so called scares that are about as shocking as peewee's playhouse which at least is entertaining it is full of ridiculous moments not the least of which is alice krige's character when she goes on a rampage and starts quipping like the villain in an old batman tv show it is so absurd as to be sickening all the people who had cameos in this including john landis are lucky they still have careers but the most absurd part has to be the cat costumes towards the end which look like cheap rubber outfits someone bought at k mart the best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats who actually out act the people in the movie,0
this movie has everything emotion power affection stephane rideau's adorable naked beach dance it exposes the need for real inner communion and outer communication in any relationship just because cedric and mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay doesn't mean there isn't quite useful insight for anybody in it i would probably classify it as a gay movie but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people mathieu's incapacity to handle his emotions divulges the way our society doesn't encourage us to act any differently and that is what engenders the discord between him and cedric this is definitely a must see,1
as a lover of bad movies i definitely hit paydirt with this one the plot isn't really that bad but there are a few instances where you really have to ask yourself what the heck is going on here br br there are many many things that make this the funniest bad movie ever first off rudy ray moore had gotten so fat and slow when this movie was filmed that the special effects consist of speeding up the fight scenes to double time there are also scenes where there is a slow motion instant replay jumping onto a ten foot high wall by playing falling off of it backwards naked men walking out of huge letters and sex that literally brings down the roof with the cable holding up the roof catching on fire br br of course no rudy ray moore movie would be complete without a completely gratuitous and random comedy club scene where rudy makes fun of all the customers interposed with people doing some odd dance there are so many things bad about this movie but they're bad in an entertaining way and if you take your eyes off the movie you might miss another mistake br br rating 1 10 for actual value 10 10 for cheese factor 10 10 for picking out mistakes and goofs averages out to 7 10,1
kudos to fawcett to taking on roles that at the time were considered controversial to my recollection rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980's and women's rights and emotions were rarely so deeply examined during that time br br fawcett is simply a woman who is followed then stalked by actor james russo he is adequate as the obsessed psychopath but at times a bit transparent br br diana scarwid has a bit role as does alfre woodard as the house mate woodard worries about the legal consequences when fawcett the rape victim takes revenge on the culprit the scene where she throws a frying pan of hot oil at russo is classic and as the rapist he deserves it she then keeps him in bondage and the consequences must be faced br br a very real story reflecting the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been violated physically and mentally highly recommended 8 10,1
this is a gem of a movie not just for people who like fun and quirky premises but who love the history and traditions of sci fi and classic hollywood movies each alien of the martian crew is the embodiment of a classic sci fi character or member of hollywood royalty and it's pure pleasure watching them bounce of each other and the residents of big bean,1
heather graham couldn't play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it who do the producers of the movie think they are the absolute worst most unrealistic movie i've seen in as long as i can remember this movie is so bad that i felt compelled to sign up on imdb and make sure the rating of this film drops br br omg i'm heather graham i just kissed a drunk chick so while she's passed out i'm really going to pace around my room for hours asking myself frantically what have i done jesus heather get over it and grow up and i'd like to forward that same sentiment to the idiot producers and while i'm at it instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story perhaps it would have been more suitable to focus the plot onto a character who's mentally unstable like your so called lesbian character after all i know the first time i had gay sex when i left the next morning i jumped to the sky in excitement in the middle of the street honestly b tch get a grip br br what a joke and please note there are many many many more flaws and appallingly stupid aspects to this lame flick but i'm so sick of even thinking about it anymore bottom line if you're a smart person you'll hate this movie and if you're not a smart person then you'll love it it's as simple as that,0
slight spoilers br br a hunchback 15 year old boy kisses a very cute 15 year old girl and eventually he has sex for the first time after the act he lays in the bed with her not touching her the next day he concludes that he does not like sex much and does not want to try it again for at least a few years br br this is seemingly a fine opening for a teleplay about a boy discovering his homosexuality or perhaps a medical drama about a post pubescent teen with a severe hormone deficiency br br however as the plot develops what emerges is a story of a 15 year old father who is supported and encouraged by his overbearing mother br br at one point his mother preaches to her co workers who are not as understanding as they might be every step of the way in this my son has been amazing i have never been more proud of him br br the young father's older sister who otherwise is cold towards her brother begins to show pride in her sibling you have been cool about this as she gives him an encouraging warm hug br br the 15 year old father wants to be a father he wants to be a parent br br why not we see the new baby a few minutes after birth it appears to be a healthy happy 4 month old infant just as babies were born on tv in the 1960's and 1970's br br once the young father is a parent he has found happiness he insists he will be the one to change the dirty diaper we see the 15 year old father sincerely happy holding his baby while the teen's busy body mother is peaking over his shoulder fade to black,0
this is a cute and sad little story of cultural difference kyoko is a beautiful japanese woman who has run to california to escape from a failed relationship in japan ken is a japanese american manual laborer with aspirations of rock and roll stardom but little concrete to offer a potential partner kyoko marries ken in order to be able to stay permanently in the u s with the understanding that although they will live together until she gets a green card the marriage will be in name only it soon develops that the parties are not on the same wavelength or perhaps in the same time zone hence the title of the movie as an immigration attorney i have seen such arrangements take on a life of their own so i was pleased to see how well the filmmaker developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation,1
to be honest i didn't watch all of the original 'howling' but those scenes i saw made it obvious that the first howling was a great movie so great that seven horrible sequels had to be made they started off with howling ii your sister is a werewolf i got this movie on vhs from my uncle sometime ago when he was giving away a bunch of old movies he bought back when atari was brand new i just watched it last night and it wasn't really bad it was just weird i mean the whole thing with sybil danning going three way with two of her werewolf minions was just out of place and quite disturbing but kinda hot christopher lee about to stab a dead karen as if she's a vampire etc actually this movie was actually like some sort of mish mash of dracula and the lost boys except with werewolves because everything christopher lee whom played dracula himself was saying about werewolves pretty much ripped off from every other vampire movie stake in the heart garlic the creature of the night must die at night and the ruler of werewolves lives in transylvania not much for the acting but the worst of it came from annie mcenroe i swear at some point in the film i found myself rooting for the werewolves to rip her throat out because that damn throat always had to say something anyway the plot is pretty silly and clichéd so there's no real point in telling you you could just read about it on wikipedia by the way the thing that really makes me nauseous about this movie is the fact that it's the only film out of all the seven sequels thats related in any way to the original not counting howling iv 1988 which was a remake of the original or in other words a sequel based on the same novel so don't see this movie there's no real horror hardly any werewolves and just horrible special fx 3 10,0
no laughs whatsoever yes i watched this entire train wreck but only so that i wouldn't later wonder if cleese had come to his senses in the latter part no he had not br br this may be historically interesting to you youngsters out there to see that british humor included black jokes like these thirty years ago br br what amazes me even more though is to read the other reviewers' comments which acknowledge this isn't very good yet then turn around and give it high votes if the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are even much worse than this one then i certainly pity your torturous existences br br the humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids yet the subject matter does not so who is this for people who enjoy repeated drawn out double takes pratfalls drug jokes interesting only as a short trip back to '77 and other low humor the three stooges are still funny and were to me as a kid too they exerted some effort in making jokes work this however is sloughed off schlock i fear that it is the end of civilization if this stuff really is accepted as worthwhile next you'll be telling me that tabloid tv is popular,0
i can't believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue such as homelessness of course brooks has not made a comedy about real homeless people no mention of drugs prostitution or violence on these streets the people we meet in this movie are homeless in fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they don't eat quite as often brooks' movies have become worse and worse over the years this is just another nail in the coffin,0
a lot of the problem many people have with this movie is that they seem to think that the story should have been more entertaining ignoring it is based on a true story or ranting against a film that glorifies che which it really doesn't this film is very close to jon anderson's definitive bio on che and gets the story right soderburgh does an excellent job of setting the mood for the unraveling debacle that was che's bolivian adventure you really get the impression of the total timidity and bewilderment of the bolvian peasant to che's revolutionary ideas or of the difficulties that his men faced with hunger and the terrain sorry to bore the attention challenged movie fan out there but that was how it happened so don't go into this movie expecting a rambo shoot em up its a true story,1
of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film from that point of view it is utter fantasy but who cares it is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with citizen kane battleship potyomkin and all the other films the pseuds tell us we should be watching films like this are worth a hundred citizen kanes it is about what cinema does best great camera work great settings and great performances br br the three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented keeping the best till last br br i will gladly watch this film again and again and again and,1
i will always have a soft spot for this disney flick another of their part live action part animation entries that sought to recreate the success of mary poppins and never quite made it when i was in grade school every once in a while we would have a movie day where the whole school would crowd into the cafeteria and a movie would be projected the old fashioned way multiple reels and all at the time it seemed like a momentous occasion whenever this day arrived and bedknobs and broomsticks is one of the movies i can remember seeing this way br br and from what i remember it's quite charming angela lansbury never put her name to anything that wasn't at least competent and she's winning here as a witch with a magic bed boy that could be misconstrued couldn't it who can take her and a couple of young kids on magic adventures to far off places come on what kid wouldn't want a bed like that br br grade a,1
up until the last few minutes of the movie i would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars however the ending is so terrible and hollywoodized that it completely undermines the first 80 of the movie br br the plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles the captain gene hackman is all for launching while his first officer denzel washington is in favor of confirming the launch orders first the problem is to launch both the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys hackman is determined to launch and washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub eventually the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not launched cool however here comes the part that just doesn't ring true after they are back on land and go before a review board washington and hackman who'd just spent half the movie trying to kill each other shake hands and are all buddy buddy huh too trite an ending to make the movie worth while for me,0
this is the 2nd time i've seen this movie in about 12 years these remarks come from someone who finds kane and ambersons to be amazing worthy films but the remainder of welles career is unfortunately squandered on material unworthy of his talent and too flimsy to withstand his filmic embroidering and when he makes a potboiler like shanghai the lack of anything substantial to hang his filmic tricks on is just kind of sad i couldn't tell you what he was exploring here it's all as mannered as welle's godawful irish brogue which takes a lot of effort but adds absolutely zero to the film several welles projects became this overdeveloped and baroque mr arkadin pick a version any version is a similarly belabored project the material is inconsequential it just can't bear the weight of all this noodling for a director trafficking in reality based drama as here he never feels any pull to tie his bundle of conceits back to reality or to a coherent story the murder for hire scheme is ridiculous br br kudos to welles though for having hayworth cut her hair and getting that performance out of her the camera loves her she's the classiest most upscale sultry and ravishing femme fatale ever put on film but her treachery comes so late in the film it feels like some desperate decision made so the movie will have some genre it fits into the movie can't be saved by a noir convention deployed in the last 60 seconds br br when all is said and done in l f s the convolutions are all for what to convince you you've seen something thoughtful to give welles more to do to make you roll your eyes welles has no sensitivity to the scale of a story or to telling a story directly one wonders what shanghai has to say to anyone who isn't a crippled billionaire arranging a quadruple cross murder for hire scheme or a fanboy in love with filmic conceits devoid of meaning or substance br br overwrought preposterous unengaging,0
this was not a well done western you've got this nut riding around in the blazing sun in a buggy with a parasol over it killing people for his own reasons you've got this same person sitting in a snow cave during a blizzard cutting off pieces of his anatomy which have been frostbitten then you've got some woman in a house out in the middle of somewhere shooting wolves that are not there what is the point of this film couldn't bruce dern find something better to do this was a waste of film,0
i love this movie purple rain came out the year i was born and it has had my heart since i can remember prince is so tight in this movie i went to a special showing of purple rain last night and it was like a concert i was glad to see some true fans cause this movie is so undervalued it is really one of the greatest movies of all time the music is untouchable the movie is about the kid played by prince his family is dysfunctional his band is the hottest act in town and he has his eyes on the apollonia an aspiring singer there is no question why purple is my favorite color i can thank the kid for that so if you have not seen this then you are need to asap this is a classic 4ever,1
phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines br br at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didn't find the jokes or oddness funny anymore br br its a low budget film thats never a problem in itself there were some pretty interesting characters but eventually i just lost interest br br i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking br br for something similar but better try brother from another planet,0
this is a warm funny film in much the same vein as the works of almodovar sure it has a 10 year old boy sucking milk from breasts but the style is so playful that i can't understand at all those readers who found it sick or perverted but would i be willing to let my 10 year old son play the part not so sure br br spanish cinema is often quite sexual but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without any sense of voyeurism or kink i think that we if we northern european types had the same attitude we'd be much better off as a result br br this liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious 'fartman maurice' character as his lover says to him 'most people are embarrassed about farting you turn it into an art form ',1
as far as i can tell you in spite of earlier comments posted by other commentors this film is currently available on dvd i found it only a few weeks ago br br it is on the value dvd label and i paid the grand total of 98 cents plus tax for it i found it at a 98 cent store among racks of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks now don't you people who shelled out beau coup bucks for the super duper swedish import limited edition version feel like you were had i thought so br br this film was indeed well worth 98 cents 99 cents i might start to argue with you but clearly worth 98 cents and remember that saying about getting what you pay for for slasher film mavens only,0
when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay speaking of gameplay the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you,1
this film has over the past ten years become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences the three storyline threads given us by kazan each have their unique and separate pleasures the domestic chitchat between bel geddes and widmark the movement between rooms the small gestures such as the phone book barbara places on the chair under her son so he can reach the table those small intimate exchanges between husband and wife all are well crafted and natural more than anything else i love their porch that second living room where it is clear they spend much of their summer time the second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film but especially between widmark and douglas' characters it may not be totally original and does get a bit blustery but all in all it comes across as real respectful and efficient the third thread the grungy tale of blackie and his tattered little gang gets us closest to a dark and frightening noir world palance's blackie is as cold as a block of ice this self proclaimed business man this self made man clearly has a complexity we only briefly tap in to for me this film continues to be a completely satisfying experience,1
some movies you just know you're going to love from the first few seconds this is one of those movies tracing it's roots back to double indemnity and the postman always rings twice in the 40's this was a great example of modern film noir in the 90's nick cage plays the down on his luck main character who gets entangled in a husband wife murder plot and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people town violence and threat of red rock west lots of twists and turns great performances by cage hopper and walsh an hypnotic slide guitar musical backdrop and seamless directing make this a real joy favorite line when cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the get away car shakes his head and says f in' story of my life,1
guns blasting buildings exploding cars crashing and that's just the first ten minutes br br this action packed film involving a rogue ex cia mercenary who can't seem to die no matter how many times he's shot hence the title is pretty decent br br tough and toothy gary busey usually cast as a villain in these kinda flicks has his usual crazy charm but is a bit more subdued after all he's carrying the entire show which doesn't mean there isn't a lot of terrific supporting roles including william smith luke askew mills watson r g armstrong henry silva lincoln kirkpatrick thalmus rasulala and several other forgotten character actors br br there's enough smaller action sequences to hold up the entire story busey has to free a group of kidnapped american military elites and return a high tech supertank a normal tank with a cheesy add on pasted to the top back to the states br br but does america deserve this killing machine any more than the bad guys this question is asked of course like in any film centering on the cia but without getting preachy,1
it's great to see jorja fox in a role where she gets to smile a lot also loved hearing her sing nice change to see her out of her csi west wing er roles the movie itself was entertaining but it seemed skip some explanation in a lot of parts several of the characters seemed to be miserable one minute and happy the next and it was left up to your imagination to figure out why each character was quirky though and in some cases i couldn't wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next this movie wasn't full of squeaky clean people but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them,1
there are bad movies terrible movies even boring movies i can watch most and put up until the end not this time avoid this like the plague annoying music throughout terrible editing no comedy its tackier than a novelty mug my missus wanted to watch this thinking it would be legally blonde material or something kind of watchable but never better than average chick flick its the first time she was begging me to push the stop button br br the girls well they were not great to start with denise done ok in starship troopers and wild things but you have sank to the gravel i feel like a mug having spent 30 minutes on this pamela anderson is almost unrecognisable after much construction work to her face br br please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells ranting at the utter mince that is on your screen,0
i consider myself a huge movie buff i was sick on the couch and popped in this film right from the opening to the end i watched in awe at these great actors i'd never seen say great word the filming was beautiful it was just what i needed i hope that this message is heard over any bad comments written by others the director has a heart and it beats with his actors throughout thanku for making a film like this one just wonderfully awkward beautiful kind characters who are flawed and graceful all at once just great i can't submit this without 10 lines in total so i will simply go on to say that i wish for more from this director more from all the actors in this film and more from the writer i didn't want it to end the end,1
first i realize that a 1 rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst this movie gets that from me because as one reviewer points out it's not bad in a self aware over the top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value it simply misses its mark on every count contains possible spoilers the dialog is completely disingenuous the continuity is so deliberate it's painful daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love and with his final word the flamenco dancers start the mock shock of what's her name see i don't even remember her character's name let alone the name of the forgettable actress when her husband the baldwin first tells her that her friend is the bad guy the car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things vegetable carts gone flying cars crashing into each other motorcycles going down the stairs people nearly being hit but remarkably no one is oh that's right except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds and an approaching car apparently didn't notice him there hmmm br br it's becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made there is so much pressure in the film industry to make money you'd think that someone in hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing now there's a novel idea br br my suggestion don't see this film don't rent the dvd don't watch it on cable there are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied,0
this is a sad movie about this woman who thought her ex who she loved so much was probably dead but really his scientist dad had just put a spell on him to turn him into this really cute shark guy kind of like in beauty and the beast it could probably use a ballroom dance scene and maybe some singing candlesticks but there are some pretty gross plants instead they make this one girl really itchy so she lets herself get eaten by the shark guy instead of scratching through the whole movie the scientist guy is a good dad who tries to reunite his fishy shark son with the woman he was engaged to he even arranges for them to have private time for s e x but the woman in this is a really shallow snob and thinks the shark guy is an ugly icky monster and wants nothing to do with him she gave up on love just because he was a shark i thought it was pretty sad how all she had to do was kiss him and he'd turn back to normal and they'd live happily ever after but it's not that kind of movie,0
dynasty revisited in hawaii full of clichés highly predictable unrealistic and sometimes even stupid if you have nothing better to do however it does provide 40 minutes of simple unpretensive entertainment endless looks at great male and female muscles and very good photography of the spectacular hawaiian scenery on the other hand if you are looking for anything more than that stay away br br oh and by the way if you have ever worked in a hotel or know anything about running one you have two options 1 you will feel sick every two minutes at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents hotel business or 2 look at it as science fiction comedy as i did lie back relax and laugh about it,0
as the celebration of christmas has evolved through the years whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other that has somehow slipped past one ebenezer scrooge merchant and money lender in 19th century london br br as his nephew points out to his uncle he doesn't keep christmas in any way because scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug the humanity in scrooge was driven out long ago he's a hard case a whole lot like his 20th century counterpart mr potter of bedford falls new york br br but as charles dickens told this tale redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit scrooge and show him how br br a christmas carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century great britain as oliver twist was the characters in this film are middle and lower class the cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in oliver twist but they are having to struggle to stay up there still love and happiness radiate their home no thanks to the guy bob cratchit works for br br like george bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much ebenezer scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old world br br patrick stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of scrooge but george c scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film the meanness of him but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change scott joins a fine tradition of people like reginald owen and alastair sim who've both done great interpretations of scrooge br br among the supporting roles i particularly enjoyed david warner as bob cratchit and edward woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of christmas present br br according to imdb this is one of 32 versions of a christmas carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best,1
normally i would have given this movie a 6 it tackles a very important topic and it does it relatively well despite katie wright which is an accomplishment in and of itself br br i have no idea if she was actually instructed to play the character like this or is naturally irritating but she did an awesome job at making it impossible for me to care for lexi there's no dimension to her other than how confused helpless and clueless she is and how good she is at whimpering i can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorder has spiraled out of control would be distraught scared and in pain however wright's entire performance is based on incessant wailing and sniveling the rest being whining i couldn't help but feel this particular girl's problem was caused not by the demon that is bulimia but by her not having a backbone i very much doubt that's the point the movie meant to make,0

i am one of jehovah's witnesses and i also work in an acute care medical facility over the years i have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions have attended numerous conferences on blood born pathogens and have seen several patients become seriously ill from pathogens induced by transfused blood i have also heard several jehovah's witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the field i have never actually seen it happen leaving the question is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community at large benefiting from the battle on this issue the issue for jehovah's witnesses is a moral one you must abstain from blood is not an ambiguous statement thank you for this movie and allowing comments on it,1
i remember first watching sabrina when it came to tv in the uk on itv1 when i was 13 14 i'm now 24 and still love it now as much as i did when i first watched it i get a little stick from some of my friends for still watching a kids show but i don't care lol caroline rhea as hilda is my personal favourite character and later on morgan also became another of my favourite characters i remember spending so much time watching various special events honouring sabrina on the tv station nickeleoden uk i love mellissa joan hart she was great in clarrissa explains all but so much better in this i was gutted when they decided to finish it i hope it will soon be released on dvd here in the uk i'll be first in line lol x,1
the interplay between the characters is a moral disaster you end up disliking most of the characters and you don't particularly like any of them br br even the two main characters played by david and gwen are so badly written that you really don't care one bit about them the movie has no plot no direction and no purpose the single redeeming quality of the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the messed up lives of a few losers and that's hardly stimulating even as an afternoon waste,0
i loved the original it was brilliant and always will be strangely though i actually looked forward to seeing the re make i'm usually a little bit against re makes because there's far too many of them but somehow this intrigued me i was really enjoying it to begin with caine brilliant as usual and jude law managing to hold is own next to him it was quite clever how it was modernised and it was working what stops this from being really good is the last seven minutes it goes completely away from the original so far in fact that is ceases to be clever and just gets annoying the end in the original was fantastic so much tension was built up and it was unbelievably clever this it grows not in tension but in frustration as it seemed they decided to make caine's character a homosexual it was if they were trying far to hard to be different and then bang law's dead roll credits this film is worth the watch simply for the performances but those last seven minutes really do drag it down what a pity,0
when i was a teen ager seeing this film for the first time i thought it was one of the best movies ever made of course the reason for that is bo derek and her various states of undress in this film however now that i'm older i can honestly say that this film is awful mind you bo derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful and she and husband director john derek make sure you see plenty of her but when you take that aspect out of the film it becomes one big dull ride and tarzan well he's all muscular like you think he should be but when he sees jane that's bo of course for the first time he doesn't know what to think this despite the fact that bo is wearing a wet see thru shirt with her breast prominently displayed tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem if you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body then this might fill the ticket if you are looking for a thoughtful entertaining and worth while film go elsewhere almost anywhere else at that,0
the problem with the contracter is summed up by the opening scene the cia want an international terrorist dead so contact black ops assassin james dial the terrorist is appearing at the old bailey court in london which begs the question why do they want to bump off a terrorist if he's going to spend the rest of his life in jail he's going to be out of circulation either way didn't the cia have a chance before he was arrested if by some chance he gets a not guilty verdict then kill him there's no logical reason to kill someone who is going to spend life in a maximum security prison br br since the premise sets up the story an audience might be choose to ignore the plot hole but the assination itself pours fuel upon the fire dial's colleague is killed by a police bullet and the taxi they're driving in crashes but dial manages to escape so the police were close enough to shoot someone but too far away to apprehend someone from a car crash the film of this type of plot connivance later dial finds a police inspector pointing a gun at him saying this airport is surrounded by armed coppers yet dial manages to escape very easily without explanation the whole film cheats its audience by relying on things that are never explained this includes an important supporting character called emily day why does she help dial even though he's a wanted fugitive your guess is as good as mine br br this is a fairly poor thriller and don't be taken in by the big name cast wesley snipes used to qualify as a film star but killed his career by starring in more and more inconsequental films charles dance also appeared in big budget hollywood productions such as last action hero and alien 3 but again he's someone best known for appearing in straight to dvd fare these days and he's basically playing a cameo role anyway the likes of lena headey may go on to become big players in cinema but they'l certainly fail to put the contracter on their resume,0
when my now college age daughter was in preschool this miniseries appeared on a e from 8 9 each morning my neighbor and i made a pact that we wouldn't miss a minute of jane eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week good choice br br i'd forgotten how much i loved this movie until i got out my old vhs copy recently timothy dalton is very handsome but still perfect as rochester the dark craggy face the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book although dalton eats a little scenery i couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy william hurt or grumpy ciaran hinds the magic here is that women love dalton and get caught up in the romance br br i would love to know what's become of zelah clarke she is dead on as jane quiet formal saying volumes with but a look the sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth criticism of her performance as wooden is misplaced a servant in a proper english household would have maintained just such a demeanor but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion unlike many other screen janes she appears plain enough to be jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy rochester's attraction to her br br bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact dalton and clarke capture the interplay between jane and rochester with wit and quiet intensity although jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard she refuses to be cowed by the dark blustery rochester the two leads play off each other beautifully br br this is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever,1
carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids when she finds herself overloaded at work she is able to hire paul to help her out paul is just out of jail and his past is not entirely behind him to say too much more about the story which has many twists would be a mistake br br the most interesting thing about this film for me is how sound is used to indicate when carla can hear and when she can't a sort of point of hear like point of view the early scenes that set this up as well as the early character development of carla and paul was more interesting to me than the twists and turns later on some of which were hard to follow and or stretched credibility a bit there is also some unpleasant violence back to the positive side the cinematography was very good br br the film is worth seeing but perhaps not seeking out seen at the san francisco international film festival on 4 28 2002,1
this isn't among jimmy stewart's best films i'm quick to admit that however while some view his film as pure propaganda i'm wondering what's so wrong with that yes sure like the tv show the fbi this is an obvious case of the bureau doing some pr work to try to drum up support but as entertainment goes it does a good job plus surprisingly enough for the time it was made the film focuses more on crime than espionage and commies instead it's a fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose now considering the agent is played by jimmy stewart then it's pretty certain the acting and writing were good as this was a movie with a real budget and a studio who wasn't about to waste the star in a third rate flick so overall it's worth seeing but not especially great,1
i highly recommend this film set in the bladerunner esquire future of 2054 paris it is in most respect a classic film noir script lady in peril sister trying to find her honest cop fighting everyone luckily it avoids being stereotypical and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting innovative visuals the film might remind you of sin city in look but it has an even sharper even more graphic novel look that i found really compelling each frame each sequence seems like it could have been pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer in terms of story and artwork you can find nods going back to the nineteen forties or even earlier with the classic views of the eiffel tower and sacre couer and movies like casablanca as well as looking toward a grim future where our destines are ruled by corporations make any excuse you need to see this film,1
how can anybody say that this movie is a comedy if i had not gone with then my finacee i would have fallen asleep and asked for my money back i love gwen paltrow but it was like she was on the wrong set i like most chick flicks but i hated this one this is the only time i saw so much clevage and was not turned on those outfits were way overdone no one talks that way anymore and i don't think they even did then the dancing part was horrible my ex said to me later didn't ya like that part didn't ya think it was sensous i said yes only to spare her feelings now i know why we never married this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,0
maybe i'm being too generous with the rating but i just love this movie i've seen it so many times but every time i see it i fall in love with it all over again it's just a simple romantic comedy with nothing huge or monumentous that happens but i'm a big romantic and this movie is romantic i love meg ryan and tim robbins and walter mathau is so funny the scientists make me laugh so much i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it it's such a clean good movie and those are so rare now my 20 year old brother likes this movie too so it's not just a chick flick i recommend it if you need to laugh or if you're just lonely and need to watch a romance if you yourself can't participate in one it's a good 'un,1
nyc model alison parker cristina raines rents a room in an old brownstone where she meets a few bizarre neighbors and experiences some creepy hallucinations as lawyer boyfriend michael lerman chris sarandon goes about making inquiries on her behalf she struggles to maintain her sanity not to mention her will to live as her experiences take a toll on her physical mental and emotional health br br i don't want to spoil the better moments in this psychological horror film for those unfamiliar with it the story is interesting and entertaining but the film doesn't really offer much in terms of real scares or for that matter any atmosphere it is sort of quietly sinister but it's not like the traditional horror film it's more of a story about a troubled woman's attempts to deal with the increasing unreality in her life on that level it works but it's not quite powerful enough br br what the sentinel does offer are some eye catching set pieces in particular the fascinating fabulously creepy climax and there's a scene with beverly d'angelo that must be seen to be believed there's also some gore to be seen but not very much an ominous music score by gil melle adds to the menace br br no review of this film would be complete without an appraisal for the film makers in gathering such excellent actors for its ensemble cast some of them don't get to do too much but to see all of them together is impressive eli wallach and burgess meredith make the biggest impressions as respectively a hard nosed detective and a solicitous neighbor other legendary names include jose ferrer arthur kennedy and ava gardner future stars like d'angelo christopher walken tom berenger jeff goldblum make brief appearances and other familiar faces include jerry orbach sylvia miles william hickey and martin balsam whoever was the casting director for this film deserves some sort of prize br br written for the screen by director michael winner probably best known for the death wish series that he did with charles bronson from the novel by jeffrey konvitz br br i wouldn't consider this a truly great horror thriller but it has its moments and is reasonably entertaining br br 7 10,1
there are some nice shots in this film it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset br br but it's basically more of a made for tv movie and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot which keeps it quite interesting viewing there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in spanish so non spanish speakers will be left a little lost br br i had it as a xmas gift as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented and matthew mconaughey was just awesome in a time to kill and the the newton boys so i expressed i wanted to see more of his work br br however although it says on the dvd box it is a matthew mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on so die hard fans really not worth it from that point of view br br the films star though patrick mcgaw is great though and very easy on the eye and his character is just so nice and kind and caring a true saint of a guy he'd be well written into a rom com br br so for true mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones i've seen i'd recommend a time to kill the newton boys frailty how to lose a guy in 10 days edtv and amistad and avoid too larger than life and angels in the outfield unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent but are quite amusing films for children again mm is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines br br as for scorpion springit's not a bad film but it also isn't screen stealing either,0
this is one of the first independent movies i've ever seen for such a very low budget it was done well as an insomniac myself i can sympathize with the main character although my sleeping problems have never been as intense or as disturbing br br well directed well acted of a subject that i haven't seen much in theaters lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting there are few noticeable goofs but they may be intended you'll see after you watch the movie the movie is very personal and worth watching twice no movie is flawless but a hollywood version couldn't do the story better all in all 8 10,1
i give this movie a one for it is truly an awful movie sound track of the dvd is so bad it actually hurts my ear but the vision no matter how disjointed does show something really fancy in the italian society i will not go into detail what actually was so shocking but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal so for the kink value i give it one otherwise the video photography acting of the adults actors actresses are simply substandard a practical jock to people who love foreign movies roberto the main character has full spectrum of emotions but exaggerated to the point of being unbelievable however the children in the movie are mostly 3 4 years old and they are genuine and the movie provides glimpse of the italian life,0
just a comment on new orleans accents br br an earlier reviewer noted the following this film could have been shot in new york or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like broklynese than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country there was also another comment along these lines from an english reviewer br br many people in new orleans do in fact sound broklynese i have never found out why it's mentioned in a confederacy of dunces by john kennedy toole i always appreciate movies taking place in new orleans that include this detail as this one did too often it's just the hollywood version of the standard southern accent,1
ok i admit i watched this movie on mystery science theater 3000 which i am a huge fan of but i am not one of those people who automatically gives an mst3k movie a 1 10 rating although i hate many of the movies they play and some are among of the worst movies i've ever seen i have actually been able to enjoy some mst3k movies that being said this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen it is no wonder in fact that the mst3k writers themselves commented that this one was one of the worst don't believe me check out their site br br to me this movie is a good example of what not to do in filmmaking the dialogue is very bad the acting is worse the cinematography is pathetic the direction while perhaps being the best thing in this movie is bad br br the pacing is the worst part in this movie a few times in this movie the viewer had to wait literally minutes for something to happen while minutes may not sound like a very long amount of time it can be in a movie particularly in this one i'm sure it was meant to create a mood but i was just very bored it truly felt like ten minutes br br if suspension of disbelief means almost falling asleep during a movie then this has plenty of that but the screaming skull is just so horrible there is no way i could have possibly even gotten interested in anything that was actually going on in the film and thus the suspension of disbelief was indeed non existant br br one of the worst and probably the most boring movie i've ever seen br br 1 10,0
at least during its first half if it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes it would have been a much better and tighter film the second half of the film is worth it especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships but it's like a dull toothache getting there also don't watch this film just because ginger rogers is in it she has an important role but it's a small one br br the film starts out showing three new york city buddies working the tourist trade and also in good natured competition for the hand of sally ginger rogers a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue world war i breaks out the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle yet enlist in the navy anyways the one of the three with the least industry as a civilian bill boyd as baltimore winds up the commanding officer to the other two robert armstrong as dutch and james gleason as skeets to make matters more complex sally has fallen in love with one of the three but doesn't have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to war br br the film is a little more interesting on board ship mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable however james gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible br br one real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design or i should say the lack of it in the scenes in new york just prior to wwi we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 no effort was taken to bring this film into period br br in conclusion if you watch the few scenes with ginger rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission you've seen everything here worth seeing the rest is padding,0
full marks for pacino's rendering of the speech over the dead kid's coffin shakespeare's mark antony would be put to shame br br was it paul schrader or was it ken lipper who should be complimented on the remarkable dialogues they are rich and intelligent and well worth your time if you like movies with good scripts i found the story narrative developing quite well right up to the voice over postscript br br there is little else to talk about in this film even john cusack has done better roles than this one interestingly the film is very male oriented the women are mere appendages,1
then they will have a proper place to file this crap sorry not a mystery as claimed it is religious mumbo jumbo i kept waiting for the unimaginable evil that was promised me but the evil in this flick would only be unimaginable by a five year old with learning disabilities br br i can't believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this embarrassment unfortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them and i will likely avoid anything they do in the future i'm also a little cheesed off that i now have a writer's name and director's name to memorize as i'll be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on too br br it's really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10 etc will get their reviews posted first this could lead to more people getting tricked as i was into believing this movie was something other than religious preaching br br well it's off to the video store to get my money back for false advertising too bad they can't give me back the 105 minutes i wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a hollywood horror supernatural film,0
curiously season 6 of the columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts based on this outing for the man in the mac and also fade into murder br br furthermore it is not a coincidence that peter s feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard here br br this adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material the story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversation br br columbo is also shadowed by a colleague here similar to last salute to the commodore but the entertainment value is minimal to add to this celeste's holm characterisation which is intended to provide comedy induces embarrassment rather than laughs br br the script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift columbo the case though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crime br br ironically what turns out to be arguably columbo's worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series he quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircut manicure at the same time the next 5 minutes are hilarious it's just that columbo's hair is so perfectly groomed then he can't afford to pay the bill and then when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstyle br br sadly this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes br br for columbo completionists only,0
this is one of the greatest movies ever maybe even the greatest movie ever i had forgotten about the movie for about 12 years until i saw an add on tv for adgth and it brought back fond memories of me watching it when i was a little kid and when i watched it a few nights ago i became addicted to the movie usually i don't like animated family movies but this one is special it is the perfect family movie br br the ending of the movie always touches my heart and saddens me very much but that is what makes this movie amazing better than all of the garbage that is coming out for kid movies today i mean the movie is g rated and it is about 2 dogs who are involved with gambling there is a lot of smoking drinking murder death and hell depicted in the movie which i believe makes the movie from good to great i mean movies today don't bring reality to kids and in this movie they did br br rip judith barsi dom deluise,1
this is one of the worst things to ever come out of england so that says a lot right there the tension when we have to find out whether or not lembach is staying is amazing though the upside is seeing the nice secretary sheila in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by dr rat face this movie has several views of london too although none of them are good there is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate back to just below normal there is also a watch that gets teleported away and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the horror of the sixth sense only a lot more dull and british add on a furious gun fight between the british police and the dr rat which results in nothing plus the electrocuting of a lot of people plus a cat and you have yourself ummm a british movie the mst3k version is pretty good although not one of there bests,0
at first i wasn't sure if i wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so i looked it up on imdb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so i thought i would give it a try expecting a movie like elephant br br once i got past the fact that i am supposed to dislike the alicia character played excellently by busy phillips i realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between alicia and deanna alicia is so mean to deanna played by erika christensen almost throughout the entire movie but we eventually find out that they despite being polar opposites they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting they share loneliness and to what extent is revealed as the film progresses br br i've just got to say how much i loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it i couldn't even get through elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the columbine tragedy this movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic busy phillips acting is off the chain that is a good thing and i would love to see her progress into some more mature roles,1
this is a terrible film and not one scene has an ounce of truthful emotion the characters are uninflected obviously drawn predictable and the story line is obvious and typical hollywood wish fulfillment br br william holden so sad to see him in this role was 55 when this film was made but he's playing someone in his early 40s and looks like he's in his 60s kay lenz was 20 and was scripted to find him irresistibly attractive i think the dog they found by the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connection br br holden's character the same age as clint eastwood when he directed this film not coincidentally is placed with obvious trappings of 60s pre hippie cool the bachelor pad the swinging hi fi the lunches at yamashiro but the film is ridiculously uncool a clanging claptrap of old fogies desperately wishing that the free spirits they saw on sunset and in laurel canyon would find them and their big honkin' cars sexy br br ugh youth culture was never that desperate and i shudder to think that bill holden was so desperate for youth that he took this embarrassing part,0
recently when i was shopping i saw the box set of americian gothic and i thought 'i remember that ' i used to set my alarm to get back up watch this when it was on ch 4 in 1996 at 1 30am i was 14 i remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird no person could ever be as frightening as lucas buck with a b no one ever was anyway br br what annoyed me though was they did the same thing to the box set as when on tv episodes in funny order i kept thinking when does dr matt leave they made it so confusing br br however this is not the writers producers or directors fault its tv people in background the money makers they still do the same just look at shows like carnivale and farscape they don't like originality in studios br br to finish if you've not seen this and you call yourself a sci fi fantasy horror supernatural drama fan you must they even said the same in sfx when reviewing the box set,1
irritating illogical flow of events pretty much every joke is so simple that it can hardly be regarded as one no wonder the cinema was empty and people actually walked away yes away i stayed since i was enjoying a wonderful ice cream with nuts during the whole movie,0
even 20 years later ninja mission stands out as the worst movie i ever managed to sit through scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene fire their obnoxiously noisy sub machine guns with wild abandon and then silently leave wow how will we find those silent invisible assassins just follow the shell casings and smoke painfully bad dialog or was it brilliant and just poorly translated not an asian in sight in the cast and a whopping total of 3 asians among the stunt crew the plot is ridiculous the acting pretty much non existent then again ninja can't act save yourselves avoid watching at all costs,0
this is a great ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s' obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was i can remember being freaked out by metal teens when i was a kid it doesn't help that i found a desecrated grave in my hometown's graveyard when i was ten turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan so maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile but i love it now as a 24 year old br br i bought this dvd used for 6 bucks and i expected it to suck due to the lame cover but to my surprise it ruled it is all about the extreme demonic power of metal and you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd this movie is awesome if you love 80s metal and bad movies this one's for you 9 10,1
elizabeth taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying untalented self in this film this was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy rock hudson was ok as bick benedict but clearly an actor with more range like william holden would have been better james dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie the whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long the actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make up hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and dean and carroll baker were obviously the same age br br 0 10,0
this movie completely ran laps around the original dolemite it had everything that makes a movie great except for real actors ernie hudson couldn't do it alone and you know that lol i admit that i have killed my first video tape of this movie and i plan to buy the dvd version again as soon as possible this movie has so many catchy lines it's pitiful i am embarrassed to say that i know the theme song backwards and forwards i love jimmy lynch's character to death and he should have won the best supporting actor award in blaxploitation but the oscars were never ready for this this is a random film consisting of crooked cops breasts chases bad editing and of course martial arts being that it's the 70's and i can say everyone knew some kind of martial arts i think this movie should be restored and shown one night in the midst of a marathon in local theaters,1
i just watched this film again and remain dismayed at the number of cynics who dismiss it as just new age pap a great film one that takes its time to develop it keeps coming close to going over the edge but never does and ultimately is meditative affecting and truer to life than most films people who dismiss its coincidences can see i was angry at the time that movies like prince of tides and bugsy though i liked the latter were nominated for best picture that year let alone that silence of the lambs won and this was ignored completely except for one nomination for best screenplay upon revisiting it i think history supports my initial reaction,1
while i watched this movie i tried to figure out why they bothered making it though the main plot of the movie is potentially good there are all sorts of unrelated unnecessary subplots the marketing people in hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys perpetual double crosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex it's odd that we see more of them having sex than we did of the president and his mistress the many plots and subplots make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed i really didn't feel like i knew any character except that everyone is corrupt and evil the ending is totally incomplete it left me more than just wanting what might have been but what was supposed to be in the end there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double cross i'm surprised that so many established and good actors agreed to make such a hollow movie this seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project br br don't waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie,0
as a convert into the church of jesus christ of latter day saints i try to absorb as much as i can of my new religion's history i was invited to attend a showing of this film with my sons the other young men women as well as their families of our ward br br on a beautiful spring evening we drove to kirtland ohio to the church's historical village located there we were to have had reservations at the vistor's center to view this movie since my movie viewing was limited to only a few church documentaries i was intrigued the only full length motion pictures of the church's i had seen was legacy and my best two years both which i thought were very well written and preformed br br at the beginning the missionary interpretor passed out tissues stating that several people had been deeply moved to the point of tears by this movie i thought ok but it takes a lot to move me to tears imagine my surprise when i found myself sobbing it truly is a very moving inspirational testament to the prophet joseph smith br br see it believe in it's powerful message,1
i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real the special effects of this movie are very good i have seen most of this movie since it's been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must admit i may have missed a few scenes but i'm usually drawn into movies and have seen some scenes more than once but every time i see some of hollow man i feel depressed almost like a film noir i'm not sure why perhaps it's that i don't want kevin bacon to be evil and there's disappointment in that but i think it's witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes regardless i can recommend this movie for excitement although some parts move slowly but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of 14 perhaps 12 if they are mature,0
how does a scotsman in a kilt make love in the bonny purple heather very very carefully now i have the distinct advantage over many other of the reviewers in that i was born in scotland far too many americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously it's a joke people four legs good two legs bad as orwell had it jessica lange has an accent that the wells next the sea amateur dramatic society's production of brigadoon would turn down liam neeson apparently popular with the ladies wears his kilt with all the authority of a man whose great grandmama once stepped off the train at edinburgh waverley and the auld enemy where would the scots be without them to hate and blame for everything messrs roth cox and hurt should be ashamed for indulging in such racist stereotyping robin hood prince of thieves seems a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison and at least alan rickman was funny,0
this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen the dvd was given to me free with an order i placed online for non dvd related items br br no wonder they were given away surely no one could part with money for this drivel br br how some reviewers can say they found it hilarious beggars belief the person who includes it in the worst five films ever has got it spot on br br how on earth a talented actor like philip seymour hoffman could get involved in this rubbish is unbelievable mostly toilet humour and badly done at that br br anyone wanting to be entertained should avoid this at all costs,0
this movie is inspiring to anyone who is or has been in a tough jam whether financially or emotionally you will definitely laugh which is the best medicine left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies grace has to find a new way to make some money and it's not exactly legal which adds to the humour even my boyfriend liked it so don't think that it's a chick flic,1
if you want mindless action hot chicks and a post apocalyptic view of seattle then this is the show for you br br the concept of dark angel isn't anything new in fact there's controversy over whether james cameron stole the idea from a book but i spend the entire hour watching it every tuesday from start to finish br br jessica alba is smoking and max' friends original cindy kendra are just as hot br br the fight scenes are getting better but the dialogues between original cindy and max need to be a little bit better the slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote it br br in my opinion dark angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for but if you're looking for hard hitting award winning drama go watch the west wing or something,1
based on neil simons play of the same the odd couple tells the story of best friends felix unger jack lemmon and oscar madison walter matthau who end up sharing oscars massive bachelor pad after felix tries to kill himself br br he had a big row with his wife over his obsessive compulsive cleaning sprees and weird phobias and sends her a suicide telegram she calls oscar and lets him know what happened felix turns up at oscar's during his weekly poker game with their friends vinnie john fielder murray the policeman herbert edelman roy david sheiner and speed larry haines after some side splitting hysterics it's agreed felix will stay with oscar br br the rest of the film centres on how these two are such completely different characters as well as looking at if oscar can stand felix's truly weird and unique habits and cleanliness and if felix can stand oscar being such a slob and his laid back attitude to everything really a film about two complete opposites living together and the joys highs lows and necessity of the gift that is friendship with great acting an intelligent and very funny script and the great monica evans and carole shelley as the british pigeon sisters who oscar invites over for a double date br br this one is guaranteed to make you laugh every line is priceless and jack and walter are fantastic with a great chemistry also made into a successful and equally funny tv series with jack klugman as oscar and tony randall as felix,1
this movie was so good leon phelps is hilarious i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac,1
this film is stunningly beautiful goldsworthy's art really benefits with the medium of film because you can see the art at its most beautiful moving and changing and blossoming i strongly recommend this movie to everyone i can think of nothing else to say about it it's just the kind of movie you have to see because it's so visually compelling and left me very refreshed when i left the theatre,1
the plot for descent if it actually can be called a plot has two noteworthy events one near the beginning one at the end together these events make up maybe 5 of the total movie time everything and i mean everything in between is basically the director's desperate effort to fill in the minutes i like disturbing movies i like dark movies and i don't get troubled by gritty scenes but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy dark literally scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming rosario dawson one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here and no she doesn't get naked not even in the nc 17 version which i saw br br if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch descent take a nap instead you'll probably have more interesting dreams,0
this is a cute little horror spoof comedy featuring cassandra peterson aka elvira mistress of the dark the most infamous horror hostess of all time this was meant to be the pilot vehicle for elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the nbc network they filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sit com never made it past the pilot stage due to it's sexual references this film however is very amusing elvira is the modern day chesty morgan and the queen of the one liners this film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal elvira's haunted hills which was meant to be a take off of the old roger corman movies but falls flat on it's face watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience,1
i like bad movies i like to rent bad movies with my friends and rip on them for their duration then there are abhorrent movies like this redline is not just a bad movie but a telling sign that maybe the american movie industry should please for the sake of the viewer at least proofread scripts before funding a movie br br if a stereotype took a crap this movie would spawn from that the storyline is unbearable and the acting all around is laughable nadia bjorlin and eddie griffin have perhaps the worst screen chemistry i've seen in a good while and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street merchants about the only thing they can legitimately qualify for furthermore how angus macfadyen got convinced to do this movie is so far beyond me that i can't even think of an analogy i am a loyal fan of his but this has made me question him br br to sum it up several people want revenge for different reasons and if you care enough to know what they are you're a bigger person than me so much so that it turns to violence i guess the movie is like ouroboros the snake that swallows its own tail in that it's an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue not fit for human ears this movie is essentially one big car commercial for the first half and an indecipherable action movie for the rest it should be avoided at any and all costs br br i wish i could find one positive aspect to this movie and i think it lies in the fact that eventually the credits do roll br br p s nadia bjorlin if that was you singing those two songs in this movie then you are a hack and i hope old age ravages you br br p s s if you do rent this movie looking for a laughable experience listen for the lyrics to nadia bjorlin's awesome songs,0
this one is a little better than the first one it still relies on a lot of its humor which basically keeps saying that the old bond movies were not realistic that wears thin after so many parodies the girls were more interesting in this one br br there is a tremendous amount of total gross out humor hopefully one day real comedy will come back,0
this is a very very early bugs bunny cartoon as a result the character is still in a transition period he is not drawn as elongated as he later was and his voice isn't quite right in addition the chemistry between elmer and bugs is a little unusual elmer is some poor sap who buys bugs from a pet shop there is no gun or desire on his part to blast the bunny to smithereens however despite this this is still a very enjoyable film the early bugs was definitely more sassy and cruel than his later incarnations in later films he messed with elmer yosimite sam and others because they started it they messed with the rabbit but in this film he is much more like daffy duck of the late 30s and early 40s a jerk who just loves irritating others a true anarchist instead of the hero of the later cartoons while this isn't among the best bug bunny cartoons it sure is fun to watch and it's interesting to see just how much he's changed over the years,1
this is one of the best animated family films of all time moreover virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of hiyao miyazaki and his studio ghibli specifically other great films include my neighbor totoro and kikki's delivery service spirited away is quite good but a bit too creepy for typical family fare better for teenagers and adult the one thing that sets laputa castle in the sky apart from other films by miyazaki is that it is far more of a tension filled adventure ride br br why is this film so good because it's a complete package the animation is very well done and the story is truly engaging and compelling br br most japanese anime is imaginative but decidedly dark or cynical or violent and the animation itself is often jerky stylized and juvenile none of these problems plague castle in the sky it has imagination to burn and the characters are well drawn if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people none of those trench coat wearing posers there is plenty of adventure but not blood and gore the animation is smooth detailed and cinematic ally composed not a lot of flat shots the backgrounds are wonderful br br the voice acting in the dubbed english version is first rate particularly the two leads pazo james van der beek and sheeta anna paquin the sound engineering is great too use your studio sound if you've got it br br one aspect that i particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned why we never know we know as much as we need to know and then we just have to accept the rest which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized indeed it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters who are for the most part one dimensional stock characters e g gruff general silly sidekick kooky old miner etc highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60,1
possibly not but it is awful even the fantastic cast cant save it ok i admit it started off quite funny but it seemed to plummet downhill as soon as they jumped those girls in the generals house bill murray turned from being a quick witted humorous guy into an arsehole who was shouting things at people in the street that just weren't funny its like he was trying too hard to be funny his character stole a weapon an rv come on and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers for a laugh one good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the us army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are albeit unintentionally i actually felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda crap could really be released,0
this movie is an extremely funny and heartwarming story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble when the director goes on vacation his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run things br br this is positively the best work that leslie nielson has ever done his idea in the film to rent out children is immediately innovative and his sales techniques will definitely make you laugh br br the little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that i know i will never forget her just make sure that you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie br br such great family entertainment is so rare these days if you go for slightly corny pictures with happy endings go for this one i could watch this over and over and i often do my only complaint about this movie is that it is so difficult to find a copy,1
an excellent film with great performances from zack lochley much to their displeasure mine garibaldi arrived on station all due respect to jerry doyle but in seasons 4 5 i lost sympathy for the character it doesn't take him long to start criticizing zack who i love best of all on the show and taking charge i'm sure zack could have coped the soulhunter plot is fascinating especially if you believe in heaven as zack does the humour supplements it nicely 10 10,1
ok so it was written in 1996 before 9 11 so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world is prescient that's it that's the good stuff the acting fair the plot silly the twist unnecessary dooooooooooom it isn't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated don't you think bureaucrats have a manual for plagues and how to contain them proper execution of such a plan is always a problem as we saw after katrina but they have a plan it isn't to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania and if the virus is carried in the air why was the plane door open and the shooters' standing there with no protection in fact did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs that would stop her but not as dramatic i'm a sucker i always watch a movie to see the end once i started it but this was a waste of time and for the most part predictable i saw it using a recorder so i didn't have to watch all the ads that was a plus it's a good example of why i watch so little network tv rubbish,0
i disagree with anyone who done't like this movie br br i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do it's sweet funny and warms your heart and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed br br and even though it didn't have much of a story it was still excellent i give it a 10 and two thumbs up br br oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wish's and dreams can come true tear tear br br i love this movie personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say shame on you because it was a delightful little movie and i'm glad that at least some people liked it,1
zabriskie point 1970 this was especially interesting to me on a personal level since it takes place under identical circumstances with identical peers in my own life  the counter culture movement of the late 60's early 70's on and off campus we follow two unrelated young people in separate stories who are slowly woven together one is a young man in los angeles tired of all the endless pseudo revolutionary jabber in the classrooms and lunchrooms of his campus and the other a young woman driving to phoenix to see her father employer and take on an establishment job the film is full of our italian director's michelangelo antonioni visual notations of america and the confused psychedelicrazies of that era's self righteous we know it all we'll change everything for the better youth just who is the revolutionary what does that really mean do you dress like one and march around chanting do you fly in under the radar but give advance notice of your arrival do you keep your plans to yourself and go about the business of change with no need for group approval zabriskie point is definitely a period piece full of slang uniforms somewhat surreal film moments after all this is a film by the man who gave us the amazing blow up of 1966 and the era's artifacts but it is more it presents options for cultural revolution and going by antonioni who does seem to be supportive of it the youth are too self involved to see what is needed for radical success because of this it becomes a powerful frightening film that applies to anyone any time any place,1
even if one didn't realize that sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and passed away before the film's release the fiendish plot of dr fu manchu would be painful viewing it is supposedly a lampoon of sax rohmer's famous oriental villain but it lacks any focus the potential for satirical commentary on the anti oriental overtones of rohmer's concept are ignored indeed the movie employs racist insults there are hardly any actual jokes or gags just mostly actors behaving idiotically and spouting dreary lines it is especially distressing to see sid caesar forced to spout curses and racial slurs for attempted laughs most of the other actors embarrass themselves as well br br and then there's peter sellers he plays the dual roles of the sinister fu manchu who is trying to concoct a formula to regain his youth and his stalwart british foe nayland smith sellers isn't one hundred per cent bad he conveys a quirky warmth as smith when he discusses his fetishistic attachment to his lawn mower and he's oddly moving as manchu when he expresses his love for english music hall entertainment but most of the time he plays both roles with a weary grimness thus further sabotaging any comical possibilities sellers' routines where he revitalizes his fading strength with electric shocks are particularly excruciating he seems too convincingly agonized to be funny br br a few genuinely witty lines an apt slapstick bit by burt kwouk cato in the pink panther films as one of manchu's minions and helen mirren's amusing musical numbers cannot salvage this mess if anyone wants to understand why peter sellers is considered a comedic genius they won't learn anything from the fiendish plot of dr fu manchu,0
marlene gorris has established herself as one of the world's great directors this sensitive visually beautiful film is based on a story by vladimir nabokov and captures well that writer's dark irony john turturro gives what i consider to be his finest performance i am usually not a fan of his and emily watson is brilliant as well well worth seeing,1
the 4th pokemon movie made me cry when celebi died don't you dare say that pokemon sucks i don't like it when people say that i've liked pokemon for 5 or 6 years so everyone should enjoy pokemon including this movie and other pokemon movies so without further ado please say that pokemon is great and should be enjoyed by people for all ages and also why do pokemon haters give low ratings for all or most of the pokemon movies i don't understand they shouldn't do that there's absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving that pokemon sucks besides the fact that 1 pokemon is for little kids only 2 pokemon is stupid and 3 people shouldn't like pokemon i think this is why people don't like pokemon,1
personally i absolutely love this movie and novel i read the book first and decided to see the movie first of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind the acting is also great and i love the cast judd crandall plays fred gwynne fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you there are also a few corny lines thrown in there idk if they were meant to be corny but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh the maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie not only will you love it but you'll want to see it again and again i recommend this 100 to any horror fan,1
this is a good movie but it is not recommended if you don't like intelligent movies it's about two guys that wish that the world would go away and that's exactly what they get the acting is great the ending was not predictable and it actually had a good story unlike most movies these days people complain about the movie being too simple or too boring i think they should just stick to movies like the toxic avenger i actually like b movies or the grim adventures of billy and mandy one note if you notice this this has exactly the same actors from cube except four actors make it two notes wait after the credits trust me on this one enjoy the movie,1
first off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies nothing and i mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just wish it would end some people want a movie that makes them think through the entire thing to which i say more power to you i on the other hand just want to be entertained which brings me back to this stinker entertainment it is not this movie is stupid and a complete waste of time seems that most here agree also most of this didn't make any sense and by the time you think you have one scene figured out another lame scene comes around and well i guess you see where this is going avoid this one sucks bad,0
this film i thought was the great journey that forrest gump should have been it's a rare treat to watch a cable movie in the middle of the day and come across a foreign film that is done so well this film is very well acted and i strongly suggest it to anyone who can take sub titles,1
for the lt to have chosen this one first the film wasn't horrible it was just hollywood worst case i need this to happen or we have no movie scenario if willis' mission was to save the doctor but she was adamant that her people make it out of the missionary he would have put her on that first chopper and marched those refugees to the border without her he would not have compromised his package for the refugees that's not how it works but as i pointed out this is hollywood we must have drama this is why we make movies because reality isn't quite so complicated however i did think that willis and the good doctor had workable chemistry that said there are also some well done battle scenes in the film it's not a waste of time tears of the sun is worth the dvd rental fee check it out on a rainy day and you'll be satisfied,0
always enjoy the great acting talents of harry hamlin jim lansford strange hearts '01 who plays a straight as an arrow husband who seems to get all kinds of attention from very charming young women namely lisa zane lynne monkeybone '01 who is a co worker with jim lansford and you wonder why he doesn't try to hit on her for some fun annie potts kris lansford breaking the rules '92 is a very warm and sweet loving wife to jim and has complete trust in her husband kris wants to always keep her husband happy and even buys him a home with out him even seeing it for himself this film will keep you guessing right to the very end,1
saw this movie twice at community screenings and really loved it i work in the jane finch community and feel the film really captured some of the essence and flavour of the community grit determination exuberance creativity in your faceness with a dose of desperation the writing dialogue and acting is solid and i really found myself drawn into the story of the young woman raya as she struggles to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process great dance sequences and it is not only the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence as well all the characters are multi dimensional none wholly good or bad and the women characters are admirably strong this is a film that has a strong beating heart and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of youth hip hop and communities like jane finch,1
i was given the book version of kazaam for my 8th birthday and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie but this time they were wrong at least with the movie it's over soon br br the acting in this is terrible which i expected from a film with shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there the kid in the film that plays max is whiny and a terrible actor he's bullied by neighborhood kids which i don't blame them because he's a little douche bag br br the story is just plain stupid and extremely cliché about a boy who's father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father br br even at 8 years old i thought this was a stupid idea it's a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it's an embarrassment and should have never been made i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks but you should already know just by reading the plot,0
it's amazing that actress p j soles didn't become a big star after playing riff randall 1 fan of the punk rock group the ramones in rock 'n' roll high school soles is so exuberant you don't mind she's obviously too old to still be in high school that fact is leveled out by having all the kids look 24 the movie is a fast paced frolic that doesn't cop out everything gets blown to smithereens at the end and that's just as it should be mary woronov an innately kinky and funny presence as the nazi like principal gets a great one of a kind bit at the beginning where frisbees fly dangerously close to her head how many takes did they use on that or was it a fluke and dey young is very appealing as soles' best kate rambeau the weakest link ironically enough in this high school chain gang is the ramones they can't act they're not funny and their concert segment goes on too long one ramones song i want you around is treated as a fantasy and is well captured other incidental songs are good particularly a rare paul mccartney ballad heard near the beginning did we meet somewhere before great fun from,1
douglas sirk directs this over acted drama about the unhappy affluent kyle hadley robert stack and mitch wayne rock hudson are boyhood friends with different looks on life kyle is the womanizing son of an oil tycoon mitch works for the hadley oil company both fall in love with the same woman lucy moore but it is kyle that has the means to wow her off her feet and marry her sister marylee dorothy malone seems to be the town's nymphomaniac and carrying a torch for mitch who always seems to be the one to clean up the hadley's messes ambitious with pretension a little over the top but the stars make it a movie to see i was most impressed with malone rounding out the cast robert keith edward platt john lurch and robert j wilke,1
the invisible ray is an excellent display of both the acting talents of boris karloff and bela lugosi karloff pulls off a flawless performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others even his wife his already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid br br lugosi plays the consummate professional who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone but still seems to have no real close friends this was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well it is hard however to hear his accent and believe he is french br br the biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on junk science but in a way even the junk science makes it work well since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic they are as relevant today as they were when the movie was made and they are also as forward reaching and always will be br br this is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again i saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and i could easily sit through it five more times the acting is marvelous and the science is amusing i highly recommend it,1
let me start out by saying this movie has 1 funny point at the very beginning with the exchange between the narrator and george narrator huh wait a minute who the heck are you george me new george studio too cheap to pay brendan fraser narrator how did you get the part george new george just lucky i guess br br sadly that's the only funny part in the entire movie br br it was still entertaining but then again i'm easily entertained br br i wouldn't say this is the worst movie i've ever seen that title goes to the terribly un funny disaster movie this movie falls 7 on my bottom 15 list br br if your a small child who is easily entertained you'll enjoy this movie if you're a movie watcher who wants a good funny movie you'll end up shooting yourself halfway through this one,0
i think this is almost all i need to say i feel obliged to explain my actions though i've basically never seen such an armature production and i mean that in all senses of the word although he physical camera work boom mic operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable unfortunately its not the only areas br br unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot this unfortunately has an awful script awful acting and worst of all awful annoying characters br br it's a crime that for the every independent film that gets distribution like haiku tunnel there's a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths i don't know who the kornbluth brothers know at sony but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution i'm quite bemused as to why they picked this up br br the only part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title however the reason for that is even a let down i hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it i've seen a lot of films in my time and i'm very forgiving when in the cinema but this was too much i'll never forget 'tunnel' for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema shame it's such a low point,0
it's funny i've seen a bunch of fassbinder films and i have found some to be extremely creative and interesting while others are repellent and self indulgent messes like this film for me it ranges from great to crap without much in the middle i know he has a lot of fans among the sophisticated but i can't help but think that a lot of his appeal is pure hype from my point of view and i know i will get a lot of negative ratings for this he made too many movies too quickly and was too self indulgent his gay or gender bending films like this one tend to be really bad sloppily done sometimes quite boring such as querelle and the bitter tears of petra von kant and sometimes just gross like this film couldn't his message about acceptance of a person's gender confusion be handled better than showing him get slapped around or watching cows being gruesomely slaughtered show some sensitivity for the subject matter and make your characters more human and sympathetic then maybe i'd care about the films br br i'm honestly at the point after watching this film that i might not bother with any more fassbinder films the bad seems to be out weighing the good,0
this is absolutely the dumbest movie i've ever seen what a waste of a splendid cast that's james cromwell as the ignoramus playing deputy i could go on and on but i would obviously be spending more time on this review than anybody ever did on the script the only thing this movie is about is us vs them and how to revel in profane slapstick beyond any reasonable human being's tolerance this is one of the 10 worst movies i have ever seen and i love james garner,0
a possible spoiler or two br br soul survivors is quite possibly the worst theatrical released movie ever nothing makes sense at all there's some plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead the entire movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that don't really tie together by the end of the film br br tha acting is non existent the camera work is jerky and the script is so confusing it just makes the movie even harder to watch br br i kept waiting for something to tie the movie together but nothing came definitely the worst film of the year 1 2 stars,0
spoilers br br while the historical accuracy might be questionable and with the mass appeal of the inaccurate lotr such things are more easily excused now i liked the art ness of it though not really an art house film it does provide a little emotionally charged scenes from time to time br br i have two complaints 1 it's too short and 2 the voice you hear whispering from time to time is not explained br br 8 10 br br quality 10 10 entertainment 7 10 replayable 5 10,1
film version of sandra bernhard's one woman off broadway show is gaspingly pretentious sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting and fitfully funny her fans will say she's scathingly honest and that may be true but she's also shrill with an unapologetic in your face bravado that isn't well suited to a film in this genre she doesn't want to make nice and she's certainly not out to make friends and that's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way but even if you meet her halfway her material here is seriously lacking filmmaker nicolas roeg served as executive producer and though not directed by him the film does have his chilly detached signature style all over it bernhard co wrote the show with director john boskovich their oddest touch was in having all of sandra's in house audiences looking completely bored a feeling many real viewers will most likely share 1 2 from,0
jessica a ghost story is as the name implies a ghost story the theme is meant to be horror but comes across closer to comedy br br a woman comes who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead this constitutes what this movie attempts to pass off as a plot there is really nothing more to it the movie comprises of a series of loosely connected scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman prior to her death br br immediately from the opening scenes this movie has the appearance of a straight to dvd effort unlike gems such as vacancy 2 the movie has no sense of direction or creativity and certainly gives straight to dvd movies a bad name the direction is as poor as can be with a complete lack of suspense scares or tension even the drama elements are hopelessly handled and represent something more boring than even the worst soap opera you may have had the misfortune of enduring br br the acting across the board is absolutely abysmal with no one actor involved managing to show even the slightest potential of a successful acting career br br many of the individual scenes are incredibly long with very long pauses between dialogue exchanges i'm not exaggerating br br the only reason i give this movie a rating of 2 rather than 1 is because some of the poor acting combined with even worse dialogue made for a few unintentional laughs i stress the word few in that sentence this is not overall one of the so bad it's good movies like camp blood or the nail gun massacre if you want to laugh hysterically watch those movies if you want to see a proper horror movie about ghosts watch the legend of hell house the changeling ringu the eye original korean version the grudge one missed call or phone br br i advise anyone who has had the good fortune of avoiding seeing jessica a ghost story to keep up the good work just forget this movie exists don't spare a thought for it,0
simply one of the best ever richard brooks' adaptation of truman capote's non fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement stunning black and white cinematography that should have won an oscar a haunting quincy jones score and tremendous performances by robert blake and scott wilson as the oddly matched killers this film was 0 for 4 at the academy awards and wasn't even nominated for best picture while dr doolittle was go figure br br although you don't get to know the clutter family as well as you do in the book it was a good decision to focus more on perry and dick and the pain staking process of tracking these guys down john forsythe is also impressive as alvin dewey there are simply no flaws in this one 10 out of 10 best performance scott wilson with r blake a close second highly recommended,1
a boy and a girl is chased by a local warrior because the boy killed by accident the warriors father or whoever he was and they travel through the nature of africa's most ruff areas br br the acting in this movie isn't that good except for that elephant kid but it's a very good adventure and it's not very censored there is some blood flesh and nudity which lighten up the movie a bit br br i give this movie a 7 because of it's picture of the african nature and it's action,1
the only film i've ever walked out on amazing since i paid for myself and my date and i'm really cheap but my brain couldn't stand any more of the dreck being piled on particularly since i could have written funnier material while tie up and gagged br br from the beginning to the end this film offends worse it ain't funny it wasn't funny then and it sure ain't funny now but even worse is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart sophisticated comedy it's juvenile really sophomoric script and ideas began an era which continues to this day where cheap laughs and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in film br br sexual olympics what high school kid hasn't thought of that the beginning of the end,0
after watching this on the mst3k episode i have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from it seems to combine elements of logans run farenheight 451 final sacrifice and at least several others at one point i was really expecting cris makepease to call lee majors rowsdower br br i wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot like the fact that even though gas is unavailable there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations and the stations are located close enough together to keep an f1 race car going all the way across the country,0
beginning with the poster featuring only morgan freeman and kevin spacey the entire movie was a fraud one stereotype after another this movie was about nothing or nothing new at least after 10 15 minutes you realize that you've just paid to see justin timberlake and ll cool j recite their way through another cop flick br br basically the story is about the corrupt system in some city all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town under the watchful eye of some hot shot politician the almighty and above the law organization is called frat and guess what they've got a kick ass loony cop shooting and beating at will suspects girlfriends you name it frat cops are corrupt and greedy so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented journalist one hour later after a series of unbelievably bad made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines everything ends happily and we get served the final line you can't beat the system bah don't see this waste of film roll freeman and spacey barely have 10 min altogether,0
four best friends young male chauvinist pigs with the emphasis on pigs meet weekly at a nyc diner to recount their dating sexploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy peet is the common denominator who dates the three bachelors in the group which leads to conflict and the inevitable whipping although the film's premise has potential and there are some funny moments to be had overall the flick doesn't work especially in the end where the girls are made to appear no better than the guys which runs contrary to the crux of the story one of those one man band flix with a dozen producers whipped is likely to be enjoyed only by the kind of young males who think the man show is emmy material,0
i was looking for a cute simple comedy to pass the time but choosing this film proved to be an enormous mistake br br i can't write a single good thing about it first the script is stupid and not funny at all relying on tired recycled jokes and a farting turtle for laughs in my book that's not funny that's pathetic br br low budget 'effects' if i can even call them effects with horrible cinematography in many places it feels almost like an indie film shot with no money br br acting i feel sorry for the actors are pamela anderson and denise richards that desperate for some money that they've agreed to take part in this looking at their recent filmography it would appear so despite the outfits pamela is showing her age and as a whole they don't even come across as sexy let alone funny br br this movie is not even in the so bad it is funny category it's just bad as if everybody involved was sick of it br br avoid,0
rachel mcadams cillian murphy wes craven the dream team this is one of the best thrillers of 2005 a great plot a great twist a great eye candy this is one of wes craven's greatest movies apart from scream and a nightmare on elm street this could be the best the plot is one of the best things about the movie and it is very simple lisa reisert mcadams a struggling hotel manager boards a late red eye back to la little does she know that she has been followed by jackson ripner aka jack the ripper murphy they have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane later he reveals to her that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the secreteary of homeland security who is staying in lisa's hotel and what does this have to with lisa well she would have to move his room to the top suite so they can bomb him if she doesn't ripner will murder her father brian cox the twist and bringing of the story really gives it the extra zing and the side characters and the side jokes really add to it overall definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005 definitely worth the see br br 3 1 2 out of 4 stars,1
harsh yes but i call 'em like i see 'em br br i saw this in the late 80's and it was truly one of the most awful boring films i've ever forced myself to watch br br yes the cinematography is lovely the czech settings are truly stunning the political backdrop is enticing but unlike similar historically set stories e g dr zhivago qv this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story or even interesting br br sure olin and binoche are beautiful but this film manages to make even erotic scenes plodding and slow i'm all for romance but this movie was so boring i started hoping the russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery br br i'm sure if i'd read the book the story would have made a bit more sense however life's too short to expend any more time on this one,0
this is the third parody of the scary movies and hopefully the last this time the spoof is mainly on the ring signs and 8 mile for some weird reason in my opinion this movie was very pointless and unnecessary and not even funny i laughed maybe three times and that is not enough for a comedy i really enjoyed the first two but this one was just plain dumb if your jokes consist of corpses getting beat up and people constantly throwing stuff at each other then this movie is for you in my opinion if your smart enough stay at home and save your money and please stop making these kind of movies they just keep getting worse 3 10,0
oh dear lord they've turned what was a fairly thought provoking movie into a swaggering testosterone fest br br the original 1971 version of this movie was beautifully vague about our hero kowalski he was a man trying to drive from denver to san fransisco to win a bet why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of uppers we're not really sure br br we had a few flashbacks that gave us the picture that he was an adrenaline junkie and presumably he had led his entire life trying to make it to the vanishing point that point you see off in the distance where the left and right shoulders of the road come together and the road itself vanishes he lives only to be free and means no ill on anyone we saw several times when there were accidents he stopped to make sure the other driver was okay before moving on even the cops that were chasing him br br when he saw the futility of his quest he took his life rather than be arrested and live a life of captivity he died like he lived running wide open br br in the remake kowalski has a whole history including a first name even he's trying to get to the hospital where his wife is suffering from complications to her pregnancy he is a devoted husband and excited expectant father he comes to the decision to take his life after hearing his wife died in delivery but they even leave that in question when they suggest that he may have jumped out of the car before it ran into the bulldozers they even gave the part of super soul the blind dj brilliantly portrayed by clevon little in the original to jason priestly give me a break,0
the last hard men is a typical western for the 70's most of them seem to be inspired by sam peckinpah also this one but director andrew mclaglan is a john ford pupil and this can be obviously shown in many scenes imo the beginning is very good in a certain way mclaglan wanted to show the audience a travel from the civilization to the wilderness in the third part there are some illogical flaws and i complain a bit about charlton heston he has to play an old ex lawman named sam burgade but he is in a fantastic physical shape i never got the feeling that he really has problems to climb on a horse or on a rock for me he didn't looks very motivated as he usual do in most of his epic movies same goes to the beautiful barbara hershey who is playing the sheriff's daughter maybe both had troubles with the director or were unhappy with their roles hershey and coburn are not showing their best but they are still good if the scriptwriter had john wayne in their mind as sam burgade also michael parks as modern sheriff is a bit underused in his role on the other hand there is james coburn as outlaw zach provo coburn is a really great villain in this one he is portraying the bad guy between maniac hate and cleverness his role and his acting is the best of the movie br br landscapes and shootouts are terrific the shootings scenes are bloody and the violence looks realistic zach provo and his gang had some gory and violent scenes what i miss is the typical western action in the middle of the movie i would have appreciated a bank robbery or something similar overall it's an entertaining western flick not a great movie but above the average because of a great coburn a very good beginning and some gory and violent scenes,1
a drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a hit man in a small wyoming town leading to all kinds of complications cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky schmuck hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding he can't escape the title town hopper does what he does best playing a psycho known as lyle from dallas the real hit man walsh as a crooked sheriff and boyle as a femme fatale round out the fine cast the script by brothers john and rick dahl contains delicious twists and turns and john's direction creates a terrific neo noir atmosphere witty and very entertaining it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up,1
this is a classic with so many great dialogs and scenes nobody should miss nice story funny riches to rags situations mel brooks is not a bad lead maybe not perfect but he is funny d don't pay attention to the rating it's bs watch it then watch something like final destination 2009 and tell me that life stinks deserves about the same rating if you do i don't think we can be friends xd at this point i recommend the fourth season of curb your enthusiasm to every brooks fan vote 10 against the ignorant opinions of inchworms i've to make 10 lines here to post a comment i don't wanna write a book here p,1
ashanti is a very 70s sort of film 1979 to be precise it reminded me of the wild geese in a way richard burton richard harris and roger moore on a mission in africa it's a very good film too and i enjoyed it a lot br br david michael caine is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman called anansa beverley johnson who has trained in medicine in america and is also a doctor while they're doctoring one day she is snatched by slavers working for an arabic slave trader called suleiman played perfectly by peter ustinov of all people the rest of the film is david trying to get her back br br michael caine is a brilliant actor of course and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff he's helped out first by a englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on rex harrison then briefly by a helicopter pilot william holden and then by an arab called malik kabir bedi malik has a score to settle with suleiman he is very intense throughout a very engaging character and so rides off with david to find him and get anansa back this involves a wonderful scene in which david fails miserably to get on his camel br br then there's lots of adventure there's also lots of morality questioning the progress of the story is a little predictable from this point and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster but it's all pretty forgivable the question is will david get to anansa before peter ustinov sells her on to omar sharif yes of course omar sharif is in it,1
caught the tail end of this movie channel surfing through the cable movie channels and was so intrigued i sought out the next showing br br i really didn't know what to expect after reading the program summary but i came away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed it also gave me as adult who attended high school in the 80's a little better insight into what our kids have to contend with these days br br the fact that you don't see the shooting only adds to the chillness of the plot to see both child and adult alike struggle to comprehend and come to terms with the senseless shootings was at times overwhelming and will admit that i shed quite a few tears throughout br br on the whole not a movie that i would seek out to what however i am sure glad i did see it,1
i was duped into seeing this movie after reading a positive review from another website and man was i p o'd it took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up off the shelf b c i didn't want anyone to see me then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it i thought that all my stress would pay off by the time i got home to and watching the movie b c the review i read said the movie was a pleasant surprise what a joke if you can make it through the first hour of the movie then your in luck b c it's not until then the movie turn's into a horror don't bother with this one folks your better off watching dankness falls,0
a very silly movie this starts with a soft porn sequence ventures into farcelike comedy in the art gallery adds a shocker of a discovery in the hotel room then introduces a random murder for no obvious reason br br what follows is bizarre and surreal the stopwatch scene in particular is exquisitely unnecessary culminating in a revelatory twist ending which is as obvious as it is unfair on the viewer see the trivia section for precisely why it's deliberately unfair br br the movie goes out of its way to be offensive to as many groups as possible transsexuals the insane and the wonderful huggie bear style racial stereotyping on the subway and condescendingly treats the viewer like an idiot in the closing scenes as characters endlessly explain to one another in great detail and over and over again what just happened in the film though the background female characters in the restaurant scene at the end are a joy to watch br br in fact the whole movie is a joy to watch despite its many many flaws the whole package just well works,1
i saw this movie on cable it was really funny from the stereotype police chief to the stereotype big bad guys jay leno and mr mayagi from karate kid star in this good comedy about a prototype car part i compare this movie to rush hour in which a local cop has to partner up with an asian police officer to solve a case the chase through farmers market in downtown detroit brings back memories enjoyable soundtrack good script i give it 10 10,1
can such an ambient production have failed its primary goal which was to correctly adapt allende's novel obviously yes bille august managed to make a superficial shallow film where basic elements of south american mentality are presented simply as side events resulting in total incoherency i can't believe there was a whole production team that could not understand the book there is of course technical quality in this film and i think the actors did their best with what they had in their hands but something is missing and this something was the most important part,1
i remember watching attack when it first came out and caught it again recently the sci fi channel has run worse but not by much a shameless ripoff of jurassic park attack substitutes sabertooth cats for dinosaurs and they are on the loose devouring as many extras as possible the cgi is pretty bad and closeups of prosthetic cat heads are laughable we get some gore which helps a little wait until you see how the mad scientist who started this whole mess gets it other than robert carradine who has very little to do the cast is unknown apparently this was shot in fiji nice work if you can get it reminds me of all those low budget monster stvs that were popular in the 80s and 90s,0
this is a classic stinker with a big named cast mostly seniors who were well past their prime and bedtime in this one br br this is quite a depressing film when you think about it remain on earth and you will face illness and eventually your demise br br gwen verndon showed that she could still dance too bad the movie didn't concentrate more on that maureen stapleton looking haggard still displayed those steps from queen of the star dust ballroom so much more down to earth from 10 years earlier br br i only hope that this film doesn't encourage seniors to commit mass suicide on the level of jim jones how can anyone be idiotic enough to like this and say it gets you to think br br why did don ameche win an oscar for this nonsense br br if the seniors were doing such a wonderful thing at the end why was the youngster encouraged to get off the boat why did steve guttenberg jump ship as well after all he had found his lady love br br this would have been a nice film if the seniors had just managed to find their fountain of youth on earth and stay there br br sadly with the exception of wilford brimley at this writing vernon gilford stapleton ameche tandy cronyn and lord knows who else are all gone the writers should have taken the screenplay and placed it with this group as well,0
greetings again from the darkness how rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain adam sandler stars as charlie a man who lost his family in the 9 11 tragedy and has since lost his career his reason to live and arguably his sanity don cheadle co stars as sandler's former dental school roommate who appears to have the perfect life that sandler apparently had prior to 9 11 br br of course the parallels in these men's lives are obvious but it is actually refreshing to see men's feelings on display in a movie feelings other than lust and revenge that is watching how they actually help each other by just being there is painful and heartfelt writer director mike binder the upside of anger and sandler's accountant in this film really brings a different look and feel to the film some of the scenes don't work as well as others but overall it is well written and solidly directed br br sandler and cheadle are both excellent sandler's character reminds a bit of his fine performance in punch drunk love but here he brings much more depth cheadle is always fine and does a nice job of expressing the burden he carries just by watching him work a jigsaw puzzle br br support work is excellent by jada pinkett smith as cheadle's wife liv tyler as a very patient psychiatrist saffron burrows in an oddly appealing role donald sutherland as an irritated judge and melinda dillon and robert klein as sandler's in laws br br the film really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected one man so deeply that he is basically ruined in addition to the interesting story and some great shots of nyc you have to love any film that features vocals from chrissy hynde bruce springsteen and roger daltrey as well as eddie vedder impersonating daltrey not exactly a chipper upbeat film but it is a quality film with an unusual story,1
this is one of the worst films i've seen in years you could randomly pluck 5 people off the streets and they could act better than anyone in this film absolute waste of time watching it i only gave it a 2 as i like gory films but this is just plain rubbish the acting and i use that term very loosely is abysmal someone please tell me that the 5 main actors in this were making their first ever film don't waste your time watching this hostel was a better film by some way i cannot believe that someone has spent money making this i hope for the producers sake it only cost 50 000 to make it looks like a school project made by kids who haven't got a clue did this even make it to the cinema,0
the germans all stand out in the open and get mowed down with a machine gun the good guys never die unless its for dramatic purposes the plot has so many holes its laughable where did the german soldiers go once they rolled the fuel tank towards the train erik estrada please and the whole idea hijacking a train how moronic is that the germans know where you are going to go its not like you can leave the track and drive away what a waste i would rather bonk myself on the head with a ball peen hammer 10 times then have to sit through that again i mean seriously it felt like it was made in the 60s but it was produced in 88 1988 the a team is more believable than this horrid excuse for a movie only watch it if you need a good laugh this movie is to tele sevalas what green beret was to john wayne,0
pretty incoherent movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s superficially hippie religious cult who fights them sixteen years later the man has a child with one of the other cultists who during a raid by the police is hidden away and taken by another man named hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river the cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town it's hard to keep track of who characters are or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place the leader gets paroled sixteen years later i got that from the box i missed the amount of time in the movie nobody is made to look any older not noticeably anyway br br one murder is done with a large circular logging saw others are done with knives or a crossbow i never heard the title character's name mentioned in the movie but he's the one who overacts the most hooting and hollering br br the movie is patched together pretty poorly with voice over helping not much to explain what is going on some of the sound effects were pretty bad a man is getting punched and we hear the sound of a whip cracking a woman fires a gun and we don't hear it fire but hear a ricochet instead it doesn't seem to have been done for comical effect,0
i can't figure al pacino out i watch him in the godfather scarface carlito's way and i think i am watching one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years then i see him in two for the money any given sunday and revolution and i wonder what the guy is thinking br br i stumbled on revolution a few nights ago and thought i would invest the next two hours on this here is a news flash want to get prisoners to talk force them to watch this over and over they'll confess to anything br br i won't rehash the plot since there is no coherent plot but it does take place during the american revolution and pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to get involved but ultimately does while he has no money no education and dresses like a caveman a very hot natasha kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason since they have only two minutes of dialogue together br br quite frankly if al smith starred in this movie instead of al pacino it would have ruined their career the script was horrible but pacino's demotivated performance and obvious fake accent made it even worse donald sutherland's role was laughable i really can't describe it natasha kinski is a main character but has like 5 lines in the movie in fact nobody speaks much in this movie br br one of the most laughable premise in the movie is how al pacino and kinski have this uncanny knack to continually run into each other on the battlefield its like the entire northeast is a starbucks hey funny to see you here again on another battlefield 100 miles away see you in a few months br br i am required to give this one star by imdb since there is nothing here for a negative score,0
i really don't have anything new to add but i just felt like i had to comment on this sack so here goes br br atrocious i'm running through my mst3k dvd collection again and i just watched hobgoblins for about the 10th time it's really really painful but it was next on the list you can see that there is a tiny kernel of an actual movie buried under all the crap that is hobgoblins but it just couldn't get out everything about this movie is 4th rate the story the acting the effects the women the action scenes the ahhhh forget it i can watch a piece of crap like the bloodwaters of dr z aka zaat over and over and over with hardly any ill effects i like it in fact btw it will be on tcm later this month october 2009 but hobgoblins is a whole 'nother ballgame br br the worst part of it all may be that it's now about 12 hours after the movie ended i had a good night's sleep some coffee and some dry toast my medications and yet the ersatz new wave dance music that amy red shorts and laraine newman were frolicking to in the living room is still running through my head this torment will last for days br br good luck won't you,0
what is this a low budget sex comedy anyway it describes perfectly the people in spain they could come up with a better idea i mean they do this kind of movies since the 60s and people like them this is neither a teen comedy nor a family one you can't let your 12 year old watch 2 guys in bed kissing he'll never want to go to spain this should be rated r because only people 35 seem to laugh watching s i'm truly disappointed maybe i don't like gays which is quite an important part of the movie br br foreign humor is awful in films except kusturica stick with doing dramas if you want a new comedy try talladega nights,0
i'm not sure if the filmmakers were after a saw type movie or 12 angry men people piecing together the facts to get at the truth whatever it was it was poorly done and not worth watching br br i don't watch movies for blood and gore but because this film had little else going for it it should have shown the actual killing more most were off camera minimizing the horror that we were supposed to feel by the deaths br br it also bugged me that the cop was among the victims he unwittingly contributed to the innocent young man going to prison by accepting planted evidence given to him by mjh into the evidence room and wouldn't mjh a the prosecuting attorney have had access to that evidence taking it out and putting the wrong evidence back anyway so she wouldn't have needed the cop's help the others while often also not realizing it was this particular person they were harming still played larger roles in his ultimate demise the gun dealer should have know his guns would be used for evil intent the insurance guy rejected a person obviously in need etc but the cop's crime seemed minor in comparison since he didn't know exactly what he was doing the filmmakers could have taken it a step further and had him be the one that encouraged mjh to plant the evidence which would have made him more culpable and mjh's yelling that he the cop got her in that mess doesn't make any sense at all br br it would been more intriguing if each person died in a way that offered the others a clue to why he she was there and deserved to die the insurance guy for example could have had the applications he rejected rammed down his throat so he choked on them the oriental woman could have had her eyes gouged out because she was a false witness etc yes more violent that the gun deaths but more interesting br br the dialog wasn't witty there were no twists and the ending was one of the worse if not the worst i've ever seen the ending along knocked three stars off my rating br br the actors did a decent job especially given the garbage lines and motivation they had to work with br br overall a waste of time,0
this movie sucked the acting sucked the script sucked and the movie overall sucked there were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening br br i'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are examples br br the heroine's negative comments about the hero the audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance's death the viewer has minimal exposure to the guy's death as well br br also all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes no explanation what so ever about the guns and the folks with them br br we gave it a 3 because we didn't feel like we wanted our time back it was fun to bad mouth the movie while watching it so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment,0
pinjar is one of the few movies that really leaves a mark and makes you think hard set in partition india this film shows the true reality of partition india urmila gets full marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional portrayal of a suffering woman with no way to go her freedom personal identity and family respect taken away overnight over a tragic land dispute manoj bajpai is simply brilliant as her remorseful abductor there several moments in the film where one is brought to tears the film at points is deeply traumatic some of the partition scenes are spine chilling yet urmila's endurance and survival are both remarkable from a woman robbed of her freedom to woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations a remarkable film that should be given credit for intelligent characters and storytelling,1
eytan fox did it again move the viewer's heart in a modest story taking place in an overwhelming mess the movie also succeeds in describing so perfectly and subtly the atmosphere of the incredible city that is tel aviv br br i was there a month ago and it is all there the lifestyle the relationships the heart beating city the mess the chock of utopian mindsets in the most light hearted blithe and oblivious megalopolis ever br br strongly recommend it is a voyage for the heart and the mind with an interesting perspective to the israelo palestinian conflict br br nota bene there is central gay plot in the movie if you do not think you are too gay friendly be prepared to be challenged and finally see it as just love and don't worry the chick is hot too,1
overall i would have to say that i liked the movie some of the fight scenes are really good especially the fight against leung ka yan one point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an asian to play a black man i mean really talk about bad taste during a fight scene you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing otherwise sammo copies bruce lee's fighting moves perfectly 5 out of 10 stars,1
this film struck me as a project that had a lot of the right ingredients but somewhere along the way they didn't quite come together i don't know who made it but it has a slightly disney esque feel while parts of it are improbable like when a pre teen runs for a public office and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously there is a healthy dose of normalcy whatever that is to keep things balanced and in perspective the acting is alright strangely the relationship between frankie and her grandmother is convincing but the relationship between hazel and frankie is a bit off it's interesting to see how she has to work hard to keep a balance between her best friend her grandmother and her two passions ballet and baseball being a baseball player myself it was quite painful to watch frankie try to hold her own on a team of boys but it does a good job of showing the struggle she faces i read somewhere that she isn't really ballerina but the editing in this film did a very good job of making her dancing look not only natural but beautiful overall it was a good film about honesty and ambition but its star mischa barton didn't quite achieve the level of realism we saw during her performances in lawn dogs lost and delirious and her small but shocking performance opposite haley joel osment in the 6th sense,1
this movie no correction this thing this abysmal abomination from the burning pits of hell should have been killed before it even left the writer's head i could not possibly come up with enough adjectives to describe this movie but let's try anyway horrible bad nauseating tasteless crap vomit inducing gut wrenchingly bad hideous nasty putrid there just aren't enough words in the english language the plot involves a serial killer who becomes a snow man don't ask how not important the killer snowman runs about killing people how you may ask can a snowman kill someone in tasteless ways that make you want to remove your eyes if only so you don't have to endure that styrofoam snowman anymore in ways that make you want to fill your ears with hot wax so you do not have to endure his snow puns anymore don't watch this movie destroy it on sight for the sake of your very soul don't watch it,0
gadar is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake story it's too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol movie that is aimed to bash pakistan the movie's aim is to misguide the viewers so they can think that pakistan and it's government is bad but trying to hide their own flaws won't work and all the songs and music of the movie are all bad most likely the sikhs will love th movie cause they are being misguided the movie sucks and sucks with power i think only amisha patel was good in the movie if i can give 0 out of 10 i would but the lowest is 1 please save 3 hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie disaster,0
one of the best if not the best rock'n'roll movies ever and it's not just mindless fun there really were a lot of clever jokes in it of course i love the ramones but with all the anarchy and the i hate high school themes the film doesn't at all take itself too seriously which is what's great about it br br i first saw the movie in the spring of 1980 and i saw it again recently since i went to high school in the late 1970's it made me kind of nostalgic br br like i said this film doesn't take itself that seriously and isn't pretentious like so much other teen fare of the seventies eighties and nineties and to speak of it's not really dirty or disgusting either only pg rated that's rare for a movie in this category a great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule,1
i have absolutely no knowledge of author phillipa pearce or any of her novels and if tom s midnight garden is typical of her work i probably would have had little interest in her books as a child when i was a child i wasn t really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count br br judging by this film version of tom s midnight garden i guess pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist tom long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didn t have in the 1950s so i guess there s some political class ridden subtext there somewhere there s also a romance involving a young girl called hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative br br this is a childrens film that seems dated by its source it s inoffensive but i m surprised by its high rating by the imdb voters i wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were 10 year olds who d just seen the lord of the rings trilogy,0
this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen jessica simpson not only lacks any acting skill but the script is incredibly shallow and lame you actually hear serious dialogue that goes i love you more no i love you more i stopped watching the movie online after the first half hour i couldn't take it anymore her southern girl charm just doesn't work and is really quite annoying her attempts at slapstick humor fall flat and she delivers lines like she is reading the script right off the page br br poor luke wilson did he not read the script before agreeing to do this or did he fall for papa joe's jessica's dad and also the producer of the movie promise of big profits hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another movie like this luke wilson is actually a good actor i hate seeing the pained look on his face as he suffers through the bad dialogue br br also i think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or hired by papa joe to give the movie a better rating no one in their right mind would actually find this movie engaging br br jessica has lots of money right maybe buy some acting lessons,0
for months preceding the release of this movie you saw it advertised in all sorts of print media so i patiently waited for its video release to see what all the hype was about after it was over i had to apologize to my roommate for occupying the vcr for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie it essentially fails because it is a character based movie about unredeemable characters with the possible exception of amanda peet whose only redeemable quality is that she is amanda peet you cannot stand any of them the film relies on its dialogue which is sophomoric moronic and crude the only slightly amusing character is eric whose portrayal of the sole married member of a group of friends is dead on the final twist designed to make you laugh at the three main characters only instead inspires the same kind of resentment towards peet all in all only rent if you are desperate or possess a dark sense of humor,0
this cecil b demille epic of the old west contains what may be jean arthur's finest performance as a hysterical eccentric incurably amoral but devotedly doting calamity jane she really pulled it off gary cooper is at his most taciturn but manages some occasional pithy sayings 'the plains are big but trails cross sometimes ' the story is a pastiche to end all pastiches all the cowboy heroes of western lore seem to be in there somehow except for jesse james even abraham lincoln opens the story in person or at least demille would have us believe so there is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety this is a 'stomp 'em in the face' tale for the masses a remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what eisenhower was eventually to name 'the military industrial complex' it isn't just a story about gun runners but about arming anyone for money and doing so from the heart of washington but let's not get into politics let's leave that to demille who can be guaranteed to be superficial the chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by george antheil who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography 'bad boy of music' antheil seems to have originated 'the big sound' adopted by all subsequent westerns whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies that is why it does not sound at all unusual because we have heard it a thousand times but he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into american mythic lore and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then corny as it may be but doubtless appropriate it is amusing to see anthony quinn in an early appearance as a cheyenne indian gabby hayes is in there somewhere but you miss him in the crowd gary cooper overtops them all looming large but when did he ever loom small,1
so the other night i decided to watch tales from the hollywood hills natica jackson or power passion murder as it is called in holland when i bought the film i noticed that michelle pfeiffer was starring in it and i thought that had to say something about the quality unfortunately it didn't br br 1 the plot of the film is really confusing there are two story lines running simultaneously during the film only they have nothing in common throughout the entire movie i was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me but it still hasn't br br 2 the title of the film says the film will be about natica jackson well it is sometimes like said the film covers two different stories and the part about natica jackson is the shortest so another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice br br to conclude my story i really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it by doing this you won't waste 90 minutes of your life as i did,0
this movie is a perfect adaptation of the english flick unfaithful ashmit plays the role of richard gere emran that of olivier and malikka the perfect cheating wife role of lane they have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the indian masses br br even then the movie has got the full traces of unfaithful though it couldn't catch up with the original it was a cheap soft porn of the bollywood lovers where mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer in the future if the indian directors plan to remake a english movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the indian censors though the film bombed at the box office the actors got the undue recognition in future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a oscar nominated film br br all said this is not a family film so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family,0
what a disappointment br br this film seemed to be trying to copy 'cutting edge' comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition jack black's acting role was self indulgent and self regarding and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting the soundtrack was tedious we are were fans of black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration why did he feel he needed to make this mistake br br we will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first br br was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel,0
here's one you can watch with a straight face with a script so bad even will ferrell wouldn't be in it br br there are two laughs in hot rod br br 1 the punch dance rod needs to go to his quiet place and before anyone can say kevin bacon he is footloosing a passionate overwrought bodyswerve to the strains of a band who wishes they had the big hair faux metal chops of europe br br 2 john farnham's you're the voice in one of those epic sequences where the star and his cohorts do the slomo walk down main street and the townfolk follow on their heels in support the soundtrack is the gag how did the film makers even come across this aussie recording artist a major australian vocalist and a genuine talent who shot to fame in the early '70s covering raindrops keep fallin' on my head then disappeared until 1986 for the big comeback with you're the voice john farnham's anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy it leveled mountains in switzerland br br besides these two high points in the film both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing the rest of the film is like choking on someone else's vomit br br andy samberg is rod a failed stunt jumper who has never made a jump maybe it's got something to do with the fact he's driving a moped into the heart of darkness or his fake mustache yeh someone actually thought that was funny br br without one jump under his starry belt he plans for a 15 bus extravaganza which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian like jason biggs or rob schneider to win the day and save his stepfather and simultaneously wipe out cancer and whatever who watches these movies for plot anyway along the way as usual for moronic leads in these comedies he scores a salubrious chick isla fisher who must surely be retarded to consider swapping chromosomes with this loser br br sissy spacek carrie 1976 has so little to do she almost phoned in her performance then changed her mind and just hung up ian mcshane must've lost a bet to be here,0
the first time i saw it i got half of it but i watched and i knew later on it was about a salem witch trials they focused on the sara good's family she is famous for cursing a priest which came true in the film it depicts her daughter dorcas and her husband the spirit of ann putnam sara's husband comes to the future hunts this girl to redeem her soul which does happen at the end of the movie dorcas is depict as witch at 5years old who is burned at the stake which never happen ann putnam saves her from the flames the girl is safe she goes to ann putnam's grave to to see that is not empty but it is at first because she accuse her of witchcraft and lets her burn to death now that ann putnam saves her her spirit is redeemed and she is not a outcast to society for the salem witch trials,1
so don't even think about renting this from the shops because this is one hell of a bad movie you'd think that jj abrahams had written this movie basically a rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to get back out fans of the completely terrible shrek might enjoy but wallace gromit fans will probably turn away in disgust also why didn't they do it in plasticine or clay i mean cgi animation for an aardman movie obviously aardman lazed around while they let dreamworks do the whole thing wrong wrong wrong nearly every single character is awful apart from that freaky frog guy who is just right for a movie villain but everything else about the movie is dull dull dull i almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie no wait actually i did fall asleep with boredom watching this movie it's just terrible but thankfully it's not as bad as shrek,0
i was dreading taking my nephews to this movie as i didn't think it was going to be well done the kids ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it so i caved i must admit that it was not nearly as bad as i had thought but was still a far cry from the book the movie seemed right on with the 10 year old's understanding and sense of humor i found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place i eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies don't show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the silly or stupid choices,0
lage raho munnabhai is really a disappointing movie i have seen the first part of munnabhai and it was really good but this one really make u bore n disappoint u br br this movie really waste yours time and money i went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in cinema hall br br role of circuit was very small n useless n this movie i think sanjay dutt cut down the role of arshad varshi br br character of the movie is also not well define like the previous one this movie show u the result of over confidence br br the ideas of mahatma is also not define and confusing br br a really very big disappointment,0
george p cosmatos' rambo first blood part ii is pure wish fulfillment the united states clearly didn't win the war in vietnam they caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh so innocent soldiers the only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war happen the character of rambo is perfect to notice this he is extremely patriotic bemoans that us americans didn't appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians like every film that defends the war e g we were soldiers also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in south asia and for that matter also the reason for every single us american soldier that was there instead rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories rather than suppressing them do we get to win this time yes you do,0
this series has its ups and occasional downs and the latter is the case here there's an agreeable amount of spatter with an inventive implementation of the baby cart's weapons but the editing film is a seriously disjointed the film making itself rougher than usual at times the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the cub who nearly gets lost early on all in all disappointment br br that said there's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers this installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him,0
after mob boss vic moretti late great anthony franciosa kills his lady whom has been cheating on him with derek their new chauffeur vietnam vet and blames it on the poor guy derek finds himself in jail where he has to contend with a corrupt warden vic's prisoner brother who runs the jail and oh yeah illegal experiments conducted by a shady cia agent great genre mainstay and first time director john saxon to turn various prisoners into super human invincible zombies of course things get out of hand and it's up to derek and the rest of the unchanged prisoners to save the day after the infected ones take the jail over br br john saxon is a great talented actor as a director saxon is a great talented actor to say this movie john's sole directorial outing to date lacks a certain visual flair would be a bit of an understatement however the film isn't totally without merit the dialog while idiotic is just bad enough to be humorous sometimes sadly this isn't really enough for the movie to coast by on that alone and it takes forever for the film to even start coming into it's own which is fairly late in the movie as such the most i can recommend this film is to say that if you're a fan of saxon which i indeed am it's worth one watch just go in with low expectations and you should be fine br br eye candy dana lis mason and tane mcclure get topless br br my grade d,0
here is one of those educational short films made to learn the unknown people out there about facts of life this time the target audience is preteen girls the fact of life is menstruation this animated film created by walt disney pictures apparently with some sponsoring from kotex br br it starts with explaining how hormones make you grow and develop with the help of animation and a female narrator it shows us how the body especially the ovaries uterus and vagina work and why this all leads to menstruation it is almost amazing becoming the comic note here how the subject of sex is avoided even the word is never mentioned although furtilized will pass once i don't really know why i saw this but since it is one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent time you might want to give it a try,0
we actually watched this twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time maybe we'd missed something nope what's missing was missed from the beginning of preproduction i actually went back to robbin's novel to see if i could find the problem and i discovered that what i thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much disconnected and fuzzy headed junk br br so the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it at all and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there absolutely nothing works not a blessed thing some beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled by random camera placement in interior shots all of the actors look at least uncomfortable angie dickenson looks positively mortified except for rain phoenix who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is the dialog is one long unwavering cringe scenes don't make sense from second to second and the connections between them are nonexistent and yet the movie stumbles blindly on convinced that it is saying something profound br br this is too bad to even be funny it is simply excruciating gus van zant has done other good to great movies which i encourage you to see and i'm happy he survived and appears to have learned from this mess,0
this movie is a touching story about an adventure taken by 15 year old darius weems darius has duchenne muscular dystrophy a still un curable disease that took the life of his brother at age nineteen and is the number one killer of babies in the united states him and a few close friends travel across the country to los angeles with the goal of getting his wheelchair customized on mtv's pimp my ride one of his favorite shows the journey begins in georgia where darius grew up and has never left the gang head west for a trip that all its participants will never forget darius gets to ride in a boat for the first time ride in a hot air balloon swim in the ocean and visit sights he's always wanted to see like the grand canyon and new orleans the filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection to the material they make no money from sales of the 20 dvds 17 goes toward researching the disease and 3 goes toward making more copies the film has won over 25 awards at festivals and i agree with the quote given to the film by variety certain to stir hearts,1
i can tell you just how bad this movie is i was in the movie and i haven't seen it yet but i cringe at the thought of anyone actually paying to see me drunk especially considering what we did that year the thing is that they probably over edited it especially the scene where my roommate was snorting coke of the tits of a mexican prostitute they probably should have followed him around we made a few come and go appearances but aside from that i can't really remember anything i was the mc in a few scenes from what i'm told what i can tell you is that everyone avoided the camera crew since who wants to be remembered as the guy who threw up or the girl who showed her tits to the world or the girl that loser lost his virginity to overall the trip itself was crazy but people act different once the camera is on them,1
hey arnold is a slow paced and slightly boring movie the plot is not very creative the paul sorvino character shenk is buying all of the decrepit low priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall shopping complex and office buildings this plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies it is boring paul sorvino is not very exciting either so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary gramps remembers something about a historical document and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when arnold and jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of helga whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to shenk's mall the kids must move around town on buses and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids hey arnold the tv cartoon is usually very entertaining and it has enough humor to appeal to adults the tv cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie hey arnold the movie is about five times more sedated and a good way to put anyone including kiddies to sleep hey arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending if you want to send your kids to a totally non offensive movie this is it i get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie the producers started out with a 30 minute tv cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes this mall story definitely could have been covered in the tv cartoon hopefully arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel,0
this kiyoshi kurosawa ghost movie is pretty wild and it did have at least one jump scare that caught me off guard but all in all the movie is incredibly stupid with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer only to find out he may have committed one of the crimes then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous asian lady ghost and has no idea why and neither does the viewer as other murders are committed he becomes even more confused as the killers are easily found and this ghost still haunts him for some reason not only is the plot completely stupid the lady ghost is more funny than anything especially when she suddenly flies across the city like wonder woman and the ending makes little sense in fact the whole movie makes little sense and i can't recommend it at all if it didn't take itself so serious i would think it was supposed to be a black comedy outside of bright future this is the worst movie directed by kiyoshi kurosawa i have seen yet,0

this movie blows let's get that straight right now there are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot colin farrel looks like brad pitt in 12 monkeys and acts in a similar manner i normally hate colin because he is a fairy in general but he's ok in this movie there were two plot lines in this movie one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache let's face it this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go the characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script the whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional ok scene but overall don't bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the lucky charms elf an american fetish that has catapulted some truly crappy movies to success,0
amicus made close to a good half dozen of these horror anthologies in the 70's and this from leading horror scribe robert bloch is one of their best efforts there are four stories all worthwhile but two sweets for the sweet and method for murder distinguish themselves as highly effective journeys into fear br br in sweets christopher lee plays an impatient widower whose lovely daughter chloe franks becomes resentful of his neglect and brutish intolerance so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her distaste for his methods franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror film since martin stephens in the innocents this installment is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage occurring off screen is a moment of purest horror br br method of murder is about a horror novelist denholm elliott who is menaced by one of his own creations the creepy dominic this episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror dominic may or may not be real so director peter duffell has a great time playing with our expectations the brief shots of dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow are truly haunting br br the original poster art featuring a skeletal figure clasping a tray holding peter cushing's severed head was a rich enticement for punters fixed on fear,1

many of the classic films of the late '60s haven't retained their ability to disturb and confront the audience in cold blood hasn't lost an ounce of its power its exceptionally well made yet forces the viewer to think some have complained not only about the film but about truman capote's source non fiction novel that the central message is unsubtle that may be true but this is definitely a case where the lack of ambiguity doesn't detract from the film at all its refreshing especially considering today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas to see a film with a convinced political voice unafraid to force the audience to consider its viewpoint to be honest i'm not sure if i agree with the film's central message but i admire its audacity nonetheless br br even if you disagree with the anti capital punishment message there's plenty to admire about the film the acting from the two leads is terrific scott wilson still one of the most underrated actors ever is chilling as the nihilistic leader one who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses robert blake is also chilling as the more submissive of the two and the one with a conscience his character obviously has a voice of reason but is terrified to go against wilson theres a good amount of homoerotic subtext on his character's part the cinematography is terrific sleek yet gritty and really giving the impression the viewer is watching a documentary add another classic score from quincey jones and you have a masterpiece 9 10,1
i just have to add in case anyone actually reads this and hasn't completely gotten the point yet these other reviewers aren't joking around this really is the worst colour movie you're likely to ever see when the movie started i couldn't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see br br they're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie it really does like the director took the family hi8 camcorder before dv cameras and computer non linear editing no other equipment lights sound gear etc grabbed some decent looking acting students and went out to shoot a movie no script just making it up as he went along br br when i watched it it was on my mono tv so i only have one channel of audio left of right speaker at first i thought i'd hooked it up wrong the movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in i got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly i could hear music and sound effects but then couldn't hear the dialog they recorded the sound on different bloody channels i mean there's movies that can be funny to watch so bad they're good kind of thing i'm not sure this is one of those i mean i'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker and seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and prove you can do it better you know but watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it br br as bad as they were the actors are the only good thing about this i thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of her bath scene a bit of t and a from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4 but alas no if you want to make a movie but it's turning out crap throw in some gratuitous nudity worked for roger corman,0
indian summer it was very nostalgic for me i found it funny heartwarming and absolutely loved it anyone who went to camp as a kid and wishes at times they could go back to the good ole' days for a brief time really needs to see this one it starts out as 20 years later a group of old campers returns for a reunion i won't comment on the plot anymore cause you have to see it for yourself the actors were great and it contains an all star cast everyone in it played a terrific role you actually felt like you were a part of the movie watching it alan arkin was especially good in his role as uncle lou he plays the kind of guy that everyone wishes they had in their lives this is also a good family movie for the most part i would suggest this one to anybody in a heartbeat highly recommended,1
any child old enough to sit up in front of a screen will be absolutely captivated by the beautifully drawn images and wonderful music in this heartfelt and humorous re write of the grimms' fairytale they'll be singing 'bibbity bobbity boo' before they can even formulate a complete sentence and will continue singing it till their dying days it is a classic for all children especially those adults who are young at heart,1
this movie is humorous charming and easily becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment hollywood is hardly the place for serious history lessons so i simply accept it as is bing in his usual inimitable style performs quite well as the blacksmith hank martin who by accident is transported back to another age the time of king arthur the beautiful rhonda fleming is breathtaking as alisande or sandy the object of hank's affections although she is betrothed to the brave and formidable sir lancelot played by henry wilcoxon br br i just love that episode when king arthur cedric hardwicke sir sagramore wm bendix and hank bing crosby dress up in tattered clothing and take to the high road with their knapsacks to experience the kingdom at firsthand king arthur's comment i say we are not alone while giving his scruffy garments a good scratch is one of those hilarious moments in the film william bendix's portrayal is superbly ridiculous not to mention his attempts at quaint ye olde english br br the story is not deep but it's well done in my opinion and i enjoy it more each time i see it it's great family entertainment too br br,1
this movie was awesome not quite as good as the leif garrett masterpiece longshot but still awesome i thought ashley looked freakin' huge compared to mary kate in this film i wonder why who woulda thought they could swith places like that and almost get away with it dad was kinda a jerk though and mom was a little too chummy with helmit head i give it 4 any one who likes this movie shoudl check out longshot,0
never when i was a child did i love any movie more then this one i would love to own it i watched it every sunday they played it on the family film festival it is an enjoyable film suitable for the whole family and the songs are wonderful,1
i have become quite fond of laurence olivier in the past few weeks and was thrilled when i discovered this gem i have always found it wonderful when i run across a film where i do not have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity rears its ugly head br br the divorce of lady x is charming till the final scene and must have been a true delight for viewers back in 1938 i only wish people today could accept and love true humor instead of the horrid trash talk people now call funny br br the divorce of lady x is well worth anyone's time,1
and the oscar for the most under rated classic horror actor goes to dwight frye seriously his name should be stated with the same awe as karloff lugosi and price and this movie proves it his character herman was one of the 2 reasons i can give to watch this movie dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed misfit a lovable yet creepy demeanor that led you hoping for a larger role the entire movie br br the other reason is the comic relief of m eburne being in the medical profession myself i have to give kudos to the expert performance of a self pity prone hypochondriac though other medical mistakes did give a brief chuckle especially when the good doctor samples his fellow physicians medication well continue giving it to her unfortunately these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake through 3 attempts of sitting through this unbearably slow movie the plot is predictable with only few minor twists the filming while pulling off a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive at making me yawn yes you can use too much shadow br br my recommendation watch this once to see frye and eburne but only when wide awake and with lots of caffeine,0
wow only a movie this ludicrously awful could inspire the similar showgirls i mean where to begin the indescibably horrid theme song pia zadora's non expressions throughout the movie the fact that despite being set in los angeles aka land of the casting couch every single man and woman is fawning all over themselves to sleep with pia zadora by any contrived means necessary or what about the fact that every person in the movie is totally unsympathetic because they're either mind numbingly stupid pia or obvious despicable sleazeball everyone else and given that this flick was written by actual screenwriters sorta it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the movie making industry who the hell would admire and kiss up to a screenwriter br br but it's unintentionally funny as hell though the breakdown scene alone will have you giggling and after seeing the climatic i'm not the only one who had to her way to the top scene at the awards all done in the usual bargain basement acting level we expect from such quality thespians as pia i sincerely hope that our dear pia actually reused that speech when she won her golden globe it's fitting and that would totally make my day br br anyway if you're a fan of bad tashy camp give this otherwise tacky movie a try,0
i have personally seen many disney movies in my lifetime though absolutely none of them match up in any way to bedknobs and broomsticks although i personally wouldn't have crossed live action with animation it was an improvement on trying to dress people up as animation characters the movie pits three evacuees from world war two who are sent to stay with a silent and socially awkward woman in the country i would have to say that the casting was brilliant angela landsbury made a perfect miss price while david thomilson made a great desperate entertainer love interest endings always surprise me and this was no exception it was neither happy nor sad though i do not know if this was intentional the dialog wasn't great but considering it was designed to be a kid's movie that is alright overall i would give the performance nine out of ten the dialog six out of ten the casting nine out of ten and the costumes eight out of ten,1
the year 2000 had been a bad year for indian films due to lack of quality and imagination from film directors other than mohabbatein and kaho naa pyaar hai nothing stood out cccc had lot of contraversy due to the financing of the film and this with not really knowing what the film is about has generated good publicity and advanced ticket sales for the film around india and abroad the only information given was that it was a suspense thriller the film is now been released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly quite good the main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well handled salman and preiti give a good performance where salman doesn't actually take is shirt off at all must be special effects rani plays salmans wife but it is slightly a less demanding role compared with preiti who plays prostitute who eventually becomes the surrogate mother the three main leads confirm after har di jo pyar karega they have a solid on screen and off screen chemistry apparently salman khan who is excellent plays a serious role in the film as a successful business man and is a pity is being exploited as a wannabe comedian in his other films as he is quite underrated in the mumbai film industry partly due to the films he chooses rani's character does not know preiti is a prostitute until the end this kept from her and the rest of the family the rest you should find out as it will ruin the film if i told you the songs are all picturised well especially dekhne walon and the main title song the other supporting actors do a minimal but fine effort as salmans loving family abbas mastan has produced a hit and handled the film subject tactfully i say go and watch it or rent it whatever you prefer,1
hmmm yeah this episode is extremely underrated br br even though there is a lot of bad writing and acting at parts i think the good over wins the bad br br i love the origami parts and the big 'twist' at the end i absolutely love that scene when michelle confronts tony it's actually one of my favorite scenes of season 1 br br for some reason people have always hated the reincarnation episodes yet i have always liked them they're not the best in terms of writing but the theme really does interest me br br i'm gonna give it a three star but if the writing were a little more consistent i'd give it four,1
creature comforts in america should have been released on a different network or at least been given the chance to have its full run of episodes unfortunately this was not the case given that american audiences seemingly have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced diatribes or has a preoccupation with scatological functions both sound and smells shows like this will be few and far between one of the main problems was that however brilliant it was it was made for a rarefied audience who knew what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at to what they were watching which is sad but not unexpected i would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct dvd release the material and the interactions between the creatures were rich with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface but thanks to political correctness such conversations take place only in my mind,1
having read diamond's book i was slightly disappointed in the series but all in all it is quite informative reading the other comments it is comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work seeing 'attacks' on 'western civilization' under every rug br br is diamond a little preachy sure like a lot of academics he sees his theory as the most important thing ever he uses the phrase 'guns germs and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series we get it after about the first 10 minutes br br is diamond a little simplistic in the series sure the part about the spaniards in south america is particularly amusing condensing some very long complicated history down to 'smallpox swords and horses' wrapping up the whole conquest of south america in about 15 minutes but the point remains valid these things did in fact contribute but not totally define the reasons for the spaniard's success against the established cultures br br is he preaching against western civilization in any way nope not a word not to my ear all he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly not that luck is the only reason br br in the end if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority then this series is not for you but if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence,1
for a good half hour or so i remember myself thinking hey this could very well be bill rebane's best achievement ever the opening sequences are atmospheric there immediately are some scary moments to enjoy and our director even refers to his own notorious stinker the giant spider invasion in a playful way the concept is shamelessly stolen from william castle's house on haunted hill with three old and extremely bored millionaires luring nine losers to an isolated mansion to win 1 000 000 in an elimination game naturally the participants start vanishing quickly and one by one and it takes the remaining greedy boneheads too much time before they realize either the old folks are sadists or there's another murderer amongst them the film begins ends with an odd narrator telling a lot of senseless stuff that isn't relevant or even interesting to the plot but there's some nice t a to admire in the first ten minutes and that dumb bimbo shelly i believe she's called is really hilarious to observe after the first half hour naturally the inevitable happens and the cold turns into a textbook rebane production with retarded plot twists the dumbest dialogs ever and a total lack of excitement there wasn't any budget for bloody murder sequences but our multi talented director tries to compensate this with endless footage of disco dancing girls and an amateur rock band the film also has four or even five different climaxes and none of them are a slight bit satisfying maybe it was an inspiration for lotr return of the king avoid this film you'll live longer and happier,0
farrah fawcett gives an award nominated performance as an attempted rape victim who turns the tables on her attacker this movie not only makes you examine your own morals it proves that fawcett can excel as a serious actress both as a victim and victor,1
simply put this is a simplistic and one dimensional film the title the rise to evil should tell you that this isn't going to attempt to be anything deep or do much with hitler's character rather from the first minutes of the movie where we see baby hitler looking evil with evil music playing the background we are given a view of hitler that presents his as a cartoony supervillian seemingly ripped right out of a saturday morning tv show the film really wants to make its case that hitler was evil but does anyone need a movie to convince them that hitler was evil ultimately making him such a one dimensionally evil character is both boring and confusing one must ask how the inept phsycotic character in the film cold ever persuade a nation to follow him or be named time's man of the year this film had a great opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the most horrible acts in the 20th century and try to delve into his mind instead it basically just says hey hitler was evil just thought you might like to know over and over again the great irony is that the film still was attacked for presenting too sympathetic a view of the character give me a break,0
featuring a few of hammer's all stars this highly effective slice of british horror revolves around a house and the fates of it's previous tenants whose stories are all told to a scotland yard detective in search of a missing actor br br story number one which is probably the least impressive of the four deals with a writer and his wife who've just moved in the house and plan to stay just for a short time so that he may write one of his horror novels he creates a demented character named dominic who's a very creepy looking strangler and soon finds himself going mad as he starts to seeing this beastly looking man everywhere he goes after his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help a sub plot is introduced which frankly didn't really work for me i won't spoil it for you br br the next story the best in my opinion stars the wonderful peter cushing as philip grayson a man who's moved into the home for his retirement years and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museum that deals in the macabre where he's very startled to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past soon thereafter an old friend who also has a history with this woman is in town for business and drops by to see him the two men are in for a rude awakening as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eye br br story three stars one of my very favorites christopher lee who plays john reid after moving into the home with his peculiar daughter jane the nanny that he hires becomes awfully suspicious as to the way reid suppresses his daughter well come to find out if she knew what lee did she would have certainly understood br br the final story is a rather light hearted vampire tale that stars john pertwee and ingrid pitt after buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant actor paul henderson finds himself turning into the very creature that he's portrayed several times in his career br br overall the pacing and direction were very good as was the most of the performances there were nice gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the ambiance this one's a keeper and comes highly recommended,1
you don't need to write a script for this trashed outrage you just sit back and watch a pair of moonshine women and guests duke each other out before a riotous audience exposure at the jerry show violent and obnoxious this cash in on the real jerry springer program reveals everything that the over rated hyped talk show doesn't show to you on the air unless you have a collection of uncensored videos made by the producers of cops even the outside world of springerland reveals the most amateurish acting of the decade this goes to show you that the gong show movie had a central character in a motion picture turkey change the channel rejected br br,0
for those of you who are not aware with the theme that kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films the western assault on traditional serbian values it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives this continuous theme expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle is one that kusturica has elected to mandate since his fantastic work and magnum opus 'underground' kusturica's films' 'black cat white cat' 'life is a miracle' and recently with 'promise me this' his slapstick carnivalistic style underscores the 'westernization' of balkan culture its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom in the case of 'promise me this' the paradoxical world of city urban space and village traditional idiom space are contrasted the world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting organized crime sexual exploitation a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values as expressed toward the young kid villager the end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one way dirt road they are on a collision coarse appropriately the wedding which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village i e traditional values are about to collide with the funeral mourners exemplifying the death of tradition within this context yet kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through his own unique stylistic singularity with his outrageous and flamboyant style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal,1
just too many holes in this movie to be enjoyable and worse of all a bizarre almost hollywood like ending that is completely out of context with the rest of the movie this is not a spoiler as you will never guess how it ends br br you will also need to be thick skinned to all sorts of politically correct undertones the conflict between whites and blacks was highly contrived and one sided i didn't understand why the author had the local black communinity behave in such an unacceptable manner is he she trying to be racist br br a truly bizare movie only watch if you like to be really annoyed by holes in the plot and like to debate all the things that may or may not have supposed to have happened br br but on the positive side the filming and acting is excellent,0
i can't believe it's been ten years since this show first aired on tv and delighted viewers with its unique mixture of comedy and horror this is the show that gave birth to a good part of modern british humor dr terrible's house of horrible garth marenghi's darkplace the mighty boosh snuff box many have imitated this show's style and i don't deny some have surpassed its quality but jermy dyson deserves being remembered for having started the trend with actors mark gatiss steve pemberton and reece shearsmith br br together they created royston vasey a sinister small town in england's idyllic countryside where unsuspecting tourists and passers by come across an obsessive couple that wants to keep the town local and free of strangers where the unemployed are abused and insulted at the job center where a farmer uses real people as scarecrows where a vet kills all the animals he tries to cure where a gypsy circus kidnaps people and where the butcher adds something secret but irresistible to the food to hook people on br br this is just a whiff of what the viewer can find in the league of gentlemen by themselves the three actors give birth to dozens and dozens of unique characters the make up and prosthetics are so good i actually thought i watching a lot more actors on the show than there were but it's also great acting the way they change their voices and their body movement the really become other people br br most of the jokes start with something ordinary from real life and then blows up into something unsettling sometimes gut wrenching sometimes it's pure horror without a set up like in papa lazarou's character just imagine a creepy circus owner on make up barging into someone's house and kidnapping women to be his wives no explanation given it's that creepy then there are the numerous references to horror movies se7en the silence of the lambs nosferatu the exorcist etc br br fans of horror will love it fans of comedy will love it as any traveler entering knows there's a sign there that says 'welcome to royston vasey you'll never leave ' any viewer who gives this show a chance will agree once you discover the league of gentlemen you'll never want anything else you'll never forget it,1
i have never seen a barbara steele movie that i haven't liked and have always been a sucker for a good haunted house story especially for such wonderful pictures as the legend of hell house and the original versions of the haunting and house on haunted hill so i had a feeling that castle of blood would be right up my alley and boy was it ever this french italian coproduction while perhaps not the classic that steele's first horror film black sunday remains to this day is nevertheless an extremely atmospheric chilling entry in the spook genre filmed in black and white it manages to convey a genuinely creepy miasma the film concerns a journalist who bets one lord blackwood and an author named edgar allen poe that he can spend the night in blackwood's castle on the night of all saints day when the spirits of those killed in the castle reenact their fate the viewer gets to see these deaths and they are pretty horrible for the most part the film does indeed send shivers up the viewer's spine and in the uncut dvd that i just watched thanks to the fine folks at synapse even features a surprising topless scene and some mild lesbianism and barbara is wonderful in this movie her otherworldly beauty is put to good advantage playing a sympathetic spectre her mere presence turns a creepy ghost story into something truly memorable not for nothing has she been called the queen of horror,1
documentary starts in 1986 in nyc where black and hispanic drag queens hold balls that's where they dress up however they like strut their stuff in front of an audience and are voted on we get to know many of the members and see how they all hold together and support each other as one man says to another you have three strikes against you you're black gay and a drag queen these are people who sadly are not accepted in society only at the balls there they can be whoever and whatever they want and be accepted then the film cuts to three years later 1989 and you see how things have changed tragically for some br br sounds depressing but it's not most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and get a lot of humor out of their situations they're well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor just as they should we find out they all live in houses run by various mothers and all help each other out the sense of community in this film is fascinating br br when this film came out in 1990 it was controversial and a big hit it won best documentary awards at numerous festivals but was never even nominated for an academy award their reason was black and hispanic drag queens are not academy material fascinating isn't it homophobia and racism all together br br seen today it's still a great film and a period piece it just isn't like that anymore the ny they show no longer exists the balls are still held but not in the spirit we see here also drag has become more accepted in society for better or worse and i've heard the houses are gone too that's kind of sad i would like to know where these characters are now i know two died of aids but i have no idea about the others and what did happen to that 13 year old and 15 year old shown br br still it a one of a kind documentary fascinating funny and riveting a must see all the way a definite 10 where's the dvd,1
if you haven't seen eva longoria from the tv show desperate house wives then you are missing out eva is going to be one of the biggest latina stars and you'll be seeing her in the theaters soon this was eva's first film and she does a fantastic job acting she was 24 when she shot it and looked hot then as for this low budget film it's pretty good for the first time director who has another soon to be released movie juarez mexico currently playing at many film festivals across the united states in fact it appears that it may have a limited theatrical release from some news what would be nice to see is a snitch'2 with a higher budget,1
i remember seeing this on tv in the late 70s and it stayed with me it's charming loud colourful a great kids film i put it on for some friends at a party recently and naturally they thought i was mad and expected something sick to happen to the puppets a la meet the feebles but no its wholesome clean fun br br jack wild is in fine form as is mama cass and the somehow attractive witchy poo br br if you like the banana splits and you are in your 30's this will re create that surreal childhood saturday morning vibe br br even if i've realised now that puf himself is a bit crap as all he does is get captured and run away quality tv movie if like me you are into death metal you'll love it,1
when i first saw the cover of this movie a giant bug chasing a few nurses and the name blue monkey i knew i wasn't in for any big hollywood movie i was pleasantly surprised to see steve railsback in this cheese ball flick who always does a good job in whatever role he tackles the fx are pretty corny there isn't too much of a plot and i'm still not sure why this movie is called blue monkey because there is nothing in this movie to do with monkey but come on people what did you expect it's not really as bad as it seems if you enjoy the old 50's style black and white bug attack movies this one is basically an updated version without the updates special fx,0
i remember my parents not understanding saturday night live when i was 15 they also did not understand rock n roll and many other things now that i am approaching their age i still remember and find i understand many of the things my kids love but this is pathetic i cannot say i have seen any by sarah except for a few appearances here and there they were reasonable i do not see her as anything special but this show is just so far below what i expected from her the imdb write up made it sound like potential so just for that i started watching the first episode i turned it off half way through anything else is better that that jokes that are meant for a 5 year old presented on a supposed adult program well sarah this adult is inly moved to turn you off i just cant believe that someone actually financed this insult to comedy only good thing i can say is that there are sooooo many bad jokes deposited here saving other shows from such an embarrassment,0
when i got this movie free from my job along with three other similar movies i watched then with very low expectations now this movie isn't bad per se you get what you pay for it is a tale of love betrayal lies sex scandal everything you want in a movie definitely not a hollywood blockbuster but for cheap thrills it is not that bad i would probably never watch this movie again in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time despite the bad acting cliché lines and sub par camera work i didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player the story has been done many times in many movies this one is no different no better no worse br br just your average movie,0
i saw this director's woman on the beach and could not understand the good to great reviews this film is much like that one two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else like his other films you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten pretty uninteresting characters if you feel you can like this film don't let my review stop you i do like minimalism in films but i feel tsai ming liang's films are far superior he has a fairly terrific actor in lee kang sheng in his films there is nothing here i wish iu liked it but i don't oh well,0
pathetic this is what happens when director comes to work just because someone is paying him to br br the intentions were good great locations and settings for a film of epic proportions but the performance damn i swear in some shots you can see extras on the background staring in the camera or looking at the actors because no one told them what they should do when they hear action the battle scenes are so bad you wonder are these people for real they could've done more damage just by hugging each other in the slow mo scenes you can see people on battle field walking around or just standing waving their hands br br only action in the foreground is somehow emphasized but for what the story is so illogical and discontinuous it seems like random situations in chronological order sometimes not even that the dialogs are dumb the love plot is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in hong kong action movies br br with a budget of 40 million and you can see every dollar invested on the screen in best case scenario the final result of all this enormous effort is a shiny round laser disk in the thin cover placed on the shelf in video store,0
robert mitchum stars as clint tollinger in this short but tough western man with the gun tollinger is a professional town tamer as in when a town needs someone to save itself he is the one who is brought in to do it tollinger's latest gig comes by as an accident strolling into town looking for his former fling he stumbles into a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster but many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired tollinger as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very taxing suddenly high plains drifter seems less original br br man with the gun starts off as an average western tough guy film but begins to surprise you more and more as the film progresses what starts off as forgettable and run of the mill ends up dark and character centered the entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable mitchum is his usual excellent self here in man with the gun not one of his very best performances mitchum still has his classic and effective tough guy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the action packed meaningful and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park man with the gun is a nice mitchum western and is easily worth one's time,1
i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic comedy i have ever seen it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation the thought that maybe they won't get together it is an indie film after all this movie was well written directed and acted the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent,1
holy this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with i tried to watch this pile of festering waste but found it easier to slash my wrists and slug back a shooter of lysol floor cleaner than endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen i rank this well below anything i have ever watched on film or tv and thats saying something i once witnessed a cow crap in a field i watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half who knows it might have moved or something well that was time better spent than watching this tripe the acting was non existent the plot was somewhere other than on this film i think i saw a cut seen early on where the plot managed to escape and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to portland in hopes of becoming a steven king shi77er please tell me director is getting medication he so desperately needs it's pretty clear he needs heavy medication and i'd willing to front the money needed for his lobotomy reversal bah i can't give this review the full punch it needs because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in typed word alone let me just say that if your looking for a flick to pass some time and you see this chilton on the rack walk to your car start the engine then shove both of your fists straight into the fan until it you can't feel your bones vibrate anymore be sure to have your wallet in hand also because you were going to waste the cash anyway you might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself br br by the way i watched this after a buddy of mine sent his girlfriend over so i could see it he dint come over she had too whats worse is that she had to watch this thing twice i heard their married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month i hope it was because of this film,0
this is what the musical genre was made of humor talent romance and action all rolled into one br br frank sinatra was wonderful nothing else needs to be said marlon brando although not a singer did a great job winning the hearts of many with his portrayal of sky masterson the fact that he couldn't sing added to his character the ladies in the film were alright but the men in the movie definitely stole the show br br it is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age it connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh br br definitely a movie to be watched and enjoyed,1
for anyone who liked the series this movie will be something to watch however it also leaves you wanting more i loved the way that every character detective made an appearance least with the ending of who is the fourth chair for they leave a reason for another movie my guess is bayless of course this like the series was a very well put together series of scenes this is a series i wish had lived on thanks to the cast for some wonderful tv,1
a light hearted comedy nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to a world of nothing anything you don't like be it a stack of bills a bad memory or even hunger can disappear at your wish they approached this movie very well and with an enjoyable starring duo there were only a few things i didn't like about nothing and they weren't even part of the main movie br br first the post credits scene and yes there is one good for a chuckle but what were they trying to accomplish with that i was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing instead we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream it tries to set up a sequel in my opinion and wasn't really necessary nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of frame br br second the trailer i saw the trailer on the dvd and like others have already said this it promotes a horror movie that never came oh well poor marketing i guess br br if you see this at your movie rental store take a look because nothing is a great movie to watch if you have a big screen though you might want to wear shades,1
there are two reasons why i did not give a 1 to this movie one reason are some of the actors like malcolm mcdowell and gwynyth walsh work who tried to play at their usually good level of acting however at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting br br the other reason is the cool idea and looking of the cyborg which is quite different to most other such roles i've seen so far br br everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be boring scenes useless and boring dialogs bad script work and it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors it could have been an interesting story though but they failed completely,0
i liked this show i think it was nothing with wrong with it only that spidey don't punch anyone but only for that the show doesn't suck some people only think this show is bad because of that the story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like x men the punisher daredevil and iron man to bad sandman never appear but i kinda like it best spidey show ever my favorite episodes are 1 turning point 2 spider wars 3 the hobgoblin 4 the alien costume 5 mutant agenda br br but there are some episodes that was really really bad like rocket racer and the spot which was embarrassing to watch and i don't like morbius and hydro man first of morbius suck plasma instead of blood and i don't like vampires and it irritates me that he was almost the main villain in season 2 of course i have to mentioned hydro man he was terrible i rather see sandman his last appearance was so terrible and i don't like spidey as the man spider br br but i guess everything than this was bad,0
i watched this with my whole family as a 9 year old in 1964 on our black and white tv i remember my father remarking that this is how it could have happened adam and eve i vividly remember the scene when adam finds eve her eyes were blackened i asked my father why were her eyes blackened and he told because she was tired and hungry having not seen this episode in 45 years i still remember it vividly the tv transmissions back and forth with the home planet scenes of bombs shaking the headquarters with the final scene of the two walking off adam carrying his pack and eve following it may not have been a theatrical work of art but it certainly left an impression on me all these years,1
since it has been some years since i reviewed this classic i have decided to go back and review it more in dept but first some insider notes from a movie critic br br this animated series is one of those that i grew up with it made my childhood joyful it made it awesome miss some of this stuff today that we clearly don't see as much as we did back in the days well on to the review br br talespin or luftens helte which it is called in denmark is a great animated series it is much like chip and dale ducktales and a lot of those old ones so it has that weird feeling surrounding it i cannot remember this series as much as i would like to remember it br br but in my opinion it was very great it came with some kind of message not that wild of a message however it is one of the old ones so that can be forgiven br br now i don't want to sound old or anything but i feel like time slipped out of my hands with these cartoons today we see something like ed edd and eddy or anything else weird like that we have all these new or nearly new shows like hannah montana or something like that yet i feel like that we don't have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early days br br now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like talespin being released again to the tv screen instead of all the new ones give me back my childhood cartoons give them to the kids i have some day give them again,1
i own ralph bakshis forgotten masterpiece fire ice on an old oop rental videotape br br well for one thing this is better than any other conan esque film you'll ever see sure it's cheesy but who cares it stood the test of time and the only way it started to look cheesy is in comparisons to modern fantasy epics like lotr fotr though i love that film br br the plot goes like this after a battle between fire ice a kings daughter is kidnapped by jarols ice subhuman creatures while a sole survivor of a victimized village rescues her br br yeah it doesn't sound as a original as nurse betty but that's not the point it is really to bring to life an interesting idea of a world of two enemies fire ice and it succeeds br br as for the action scenes superb they are well handled have terrific suspence and have plenty of loud noises just check out the climatic battle now that's an ending br br the acting and dialogue competent really they aren't gonna be nominated for an oscar but they are ok and don't get on your nerves br br the animation is quite good shot on 3d and rotoscoped i think it looks pretty good a lot of the backgrounds look really detailed and well drawn and although the character designs feel a little 1 dimentional they are ok br br overall this is a fine neglected little gem and will entertain you more than any of the superfical entertainment 10 10,1
the good br br effective color scheme good costumes top notch set production well detailed cgi buildings and vehicles br br the bad br br horrible mixture of actors with all cgi actors mixes fifth element with final fantasy the cgi actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago flawed logic a giant pyramid shows up and no one researches it no one really even questions it and there is no explanation as to why the god horus was even cast out nor was there any reason why he must do something as trivial as impregnate jill br br the ugly br br awful script so many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized the dialog was almost laughable at some points random characters and events that are not needed dull characters jill is supposed to be this mystery but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer there is nothing to her she is uninteresting and boring to watch she has no substance no texture her character has no redeeming qualities in fact there is not one character in the entire film who has any purpose any goals besides the obvious one of horus any motivation they are weak and ill conceived there are no stakes the key to screen writing horus will not become immortal but big deal he is a bad guy one cannot even decipher whether horus or jill is the main character that is the problem devoting half the movie to each character means the writer never fully explores one character never brings one to fruition they are cardboard cut outs who walk around and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore the fine set pieces first time director pacing slow slow slow i am still watching the movie as i write this i cannot pay attention because it is boring everything is flat even the action is not interesting because it is short lived and sometimes unnecessary br br overall br br not worth a watch threadbare story sub par character development corny cgi does not save the nice set production,0
i happened to see this movie twice or more and found it well made wwii had freshly ended and the so called cold war was about to begin this movie could therefore be defined as one of the best propaganda patriotic movies preparing americans and secondly people from the still to be formed western nato block of countries to face the next coming menace the movie celebrates the might of the us through the centuries while projecting itself onwards to the then present war which had just ended nice and funny is the way of describing the discovering of the american continent by columbus and pretty the espisode of new amsterdam and the purchasing of manhattan from a drunk local indian must see it at least once for curiosity of fashion of propaganda through time,1
routine suspense yarn about a sociopath dillon who gives his sperm to a clinic of human reproduction and starts to harrass the lives of the woman antony and his husband mancuso extremely predictable far fetched and with undecided tone all the way don't lose your time with this one make a baby instead,0
sisters in law is made by the same directors of the rather curiously fascinating 'divorce iranian style' which was as exactly as it stated as we got a glimpse of divorce court in iran now they've turned their attention to the court system in cameroon africa what's great about this court is that 2 of the magistrates are women which is unusual for such a country like this anyways they deal with plenty of men used to getting their way around the women but this film is remarkable in the fact that it appears that women has made great strides in society with divorce legal and women's rights being recognized so the judges often chastise the men for behaving in a primitive way in these times not to say that the women who appear at the court get the softer treatment one of the prime focuses of the film is a case of child abuse done by an aunt the judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury and who said that justice isn't served anymore with these 2 behind the bench they often carry out maximum penalties ya you go girl,1
misty ayers had a smoking body and that's all this movie was about pure exploitation flick i started playing a game with myself counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music and of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes case in point casually walking into a room and saying hello was scored with chase music from a roman epic i'd like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released what i learned from this movie that women's low rise panties existed in 1954 i'm talking sigourney weaver in the original alien movie panties at least 20 of the first 30 minutes is misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing except for bra and panties sadly also includes horrendous dubbing leading to a look out godzirra effect,0
it makes one wonder how this show is still on the air there's been one couple that has stayed together married and has children but everyone else has broken up what's the point of continuing this the show can be entertaining at the beginning you see all the girls swooning over one man that almost all of them like instantly it's just like in real life the girls start to take sides bitch one another out and show their true selves or so we think but that one man is left to decide who to pick that he thinks he can marry and live happily ever after br br what is true love exactly how can you fall for someone when you're forced to pick them this show is unbelievable you thought dating online was bad but people have to go on tv to find love it's not realistic how could a girl be with a man when he is going out with several others making out with them none of these questions are answered and finally when the show ends you know there won't be a happy ending in the future for all we know everything is scripted,0
a really sweet movie that has some similarities to the 2001 hit my sassy girl but is able to enchant most of the time the biggest applause should go to the two leads ha neul kim is both sweet and quirky sang woo kwon is both attractive and rebellious the chemistry between the two is very good br br director kyeong hyeong kim uses some cg inserts to pepper up the visuals and also offers impressive fight scenes in which sang woo kwon can shine i liked him a lot better here than in the highly overrated volcano high and that boy has a future those looks those fight techniques and a romantic lead not bad br br well i can make it short nice film my rating 7 10,1
what happened to these unlikeable people alan arkin was as usual unfunny and just walks through the role the kids are all a mess mariesa tomei probably wishes this role had never come her way and what are carl reiner and rita moreno doing in this really bad mean movie if you enjoy watching losers wallow in their disfunction and not try in any way to do better this is your film all others take a walk read a book or see something else br br jane,0
this series is one of the worst shows i have ever seen terrible acting terrible effects terrible writing you get my drift the stories are so far from the legend of robin hood it's amazing looks like they just wanted to use the name robin hood to attract an audience it might as well have been called new adventures of mr bland acting br br someone commented before me that if you had imagination you'd love this show that is a horrible approach to a tv series a visual media like this should spark your imagination you shouldn't have to force your imagination into something to make it good that would be like the simpsons episode where they try to brainwash homer with a religious propaganda movie and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever if a movie is boring i just make up my own story br br in conclusion absolute human waste,0
it's good to see that vintage film buff have correctly categorized their excellent dvd release as a musical for that's what this film is pure and simple like its unofficial remake murder at the windmill 1949 the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with kitty carlisle and gertrude michael leading a cast of super decorative girls including ann sheridan lucy ball beryl wallace gwenllian gill gladys young barbara fritchie wanda perry and dorothy white carl brisson is also on hand to lend his strong voice to cocktails for two undoubtedly the movie's most popular song it is heard no less than four times however it's gertrude michael who steals the show not only with her rendition of sweet marijauna but her strong performance as the hero's rejected girlfriend as for the rest of the cast we could have done without jack oakie and victor mclaglen altogether the only good thing about oakie's role is his weak running gag with cult icon toby wing in fact to give you an idea as to how far the rest of the comedy is over indulged and over strained super dumb inspector mclaglen simply cannot put his hands on the killer even though would you believe in this instance it happens to be the person you most suspect director mitch leisen actually goes to great pains to point the killer out to even the dumbest member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned close up after close up,1
i saw the film and i got screwed because the film was foolish and boring i thought ram gopal varma will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole film got spoiled and they spoiled sholay the cast and crew was bad the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people ran away in the middle amithab bachan's acting is poor i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the year sure nobody did justice to their work including ajay devagan this film don't deserve any audiences i bet that this film will flop br br finally this movie sucks,0
far by my most second favourite cartoon spielberg did after animaniacs even if the ratings were low so what i still enjoyed it and loved it was so funny and i adored the cast wow jess harnell and tress macneille were in there and were just fantastic the whole cast were brilliant especially the legendary frank welker br br i'd love to see this cartoon again was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant also i can remember the hilarious moment where brain cameos in it you hear his voice and it played the patb theme instrumental that was just fantastic i love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in i wish this cartoon and animaniacs came back i loved them,1
whenever a columbo story deviates from the familiar plot colorful killer commits crime columbo smokes out killer columbo becomes a pest in the process the writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes this episode deviates in the extreme and the result is a major flop br br would you believe columbo never faces the villain till the very end br br frankly i was tempted to turn it off about two thirds through br br oh the sacrifices we self appointed reviewers make,0
if movies like ghoulies rip off gremlins then hobgoblins sinks to the new low of ripping off garbage like ghoulies these barely animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies which involve basically groteque characters' sex dreams oh joy but what that has to do with anything is anybody's guess except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica they show this down in the 8th circle of hell one suspects there's no real plot just goblins kill and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to arouse the viewing audience,0
nikolai gogol's story viy has been filmed again and released to home video in the us via faith films br br the original story concerns a priest who has to watch over the body of a witch with only his faith to protect him greatly expanded and set in america though clearly filmed in russia the houses clothing and furnishing are all wrong despite the english signs this is an odd film that doesn't really work part of it is the weird setting that tries very hard to be backwoods america but clearly isn't there are also some weird intentionally oblique moments as the main character being a reporter at the start and a priest a short time later i'm not sure why they did that even after watching the making of piece on the dvd the other problem is the dubbing which is beyond awful its done in such away that everyone speaks when their lips are not on camera or if they are the voices don't even remotely match the lip flaps i don't know if its faith films fault or that of the producers who made the film hoping to dump into the west revealed in the making of piece br br the film isn't very good as i've said it has all sorts of technical issues that just make this an odd ball curio despite some really good looking horror images the film never works as a horror film as film to engender faith its much too confused in this retelling to amount to make anyone feel anyone closer to god br br given the choice i'd give it a pass even at a bargain bin price my advice would be to find the 1960's version of the tale called viy which will bring both some shivers and some understanding about a belief in god,0
my choice for greatest movie ever used to be laughton's night of the hunter which remains superb in my canon but it may have been supplanted by shower which is the most artistically daoist movie i have seen the way that caring for others is represented by the flowing of water and the way that water can be made inspiration and comfort and cleansing and etc is the essence of the dao it is possible to argue that the the nofth and shower themes are similar and that lillian gish in the former represents the purest form of christianity as the operators of the bathhouse represent the purest form of daoism i would not in any way argue against such an interpretation both movies are visual joys in their integration of idea and image yet shower presents such an unstylized view of the sacredness of everyday life that i give it the nod i revere both,1
i have to say that this was not very exciting but talk about fashion and weird ways to solve a mystery a little too simple nancy drew emma roberts uses imdb that's fantastic i really liked about that part of the movie br br corky josh flitter is however extremely hilarious and ned nickerson max thieriot seemed really hopeless he should have been more angry with her for how she has treated him br br alright this movie is tour and fashion in disguise anyhow i recommend this movie just for summer fun encore nancy just for fun more teen spy movies by emma roberts spymate remember she's becoming good at this tricky detective work,1
first thing first in this genre movie the first thing you need is a good music and thats where mr shankar and his party fails br br music is completely pale and uneffective on other hand there is ajay devgan who has removed a letter 'a' from his spelling done good job but was of no use to a bad casted movies like this br br asin is like a doll which is used to amuse public even though she is good to look at but her role in movie is to dance actually she is dancing member of a rock band and i don't think any rock band have there dancer as a member of band br br in nut shell this movie is a piece of crap a piece of t watch it if you wanna get fooled,0
rosario dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge while its clear why dawson took the role its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent decidedly un hollywood film its also clear that aside from stunning good looks dawson seems out of place in the role forgive me i simply couldn't find her thats not a mistake thats how i felt i had no idea where she was yes i know she's on the screen but even though i spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever i blame the script for this since other than the ending not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense the people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didn't seem to fit together forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film other than the end which i would love to talk about but can't cause it would spoil it and the image of rosario dawson as nothing more than an image stayed with me what can i say this may click with you it may not for me it's time i can't get back for rosario dawson fans only though be warned there's several real reasons why this is nc17 and rosario please you're a better actress pick better scripts,0
having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the slavic village broadway area i couldn't wait to see it's final copy br br viewing this film at the cleveland premier last friday i haven't laughed out loud at a comedy in a long time it is great slapstick the russo brothers did a fine job directing the entire cast performs their best comedic acting no slow or dry segments george clooney is one of my favorite actors and he's great as the crippled safe breaker in this flick i was most imprest by william h macy as crook riley and michael jeter's as toto they keep you in stitches i believe they have the funniest roles in the entire movie,1
this film had a lot of promise and the plot was relatively interesting however the actors director and editors seriously let this film down br br i feel bad for the writers it could have been good the acting is wooden very few of the characters are believable br br who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film there are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying br br i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no it left me feeling like i'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money,0
witchery might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80's but luckily enough it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices honestly the screenplay doesn't make one iota of sense but who cares when linda blair with an exploded hairstyle portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and david hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer who can't seem to get laid in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo sewn shut lips upside down crucifixions vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of massachusetts the young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history the dysfunctional family with a pregnant linda blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are considers re opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex they're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window anyway the plot is definitely of minor importance in an italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin off of the evil dead the atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film there's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried,0
a stunning film of high quality br br apparently based on true events which as told has the clear ring of truth about it this movie is highly emotional and deeply moving br br an abused and neglected child often becomes wayward in adulthood as one of life's failures be it as a gangster drug addict or burden on society br br antwone fisher as a young adult in the navy is troubled he is on the brink of being a loser he is counselled in therapy by a psychiatrist and it is that relationship which takes center stage in the play br br in flash backs and therapy the source and remedies to antwones angst are revealed br br outstanding performances from the whole cast the story is in effect a family tragedy with emotional and physical torment all the actors give full blooded performances with conviction and realism br br one message from the movie is the importance of raising children decently br br the real antwone deserves success to have endured wickedness as a child but to rise above that shows a magnificent character br br and to all those out there who have endured such torment but to have survived and succeeded you are all winners 10 out of 10,1
i love horror films low budget 50's 60's 70's 80's but how can anyone think this is a very good horror film let's compare it to titles in a similar vein haunted house films the haunting the changeling the shining or for a similar technology based horror film that was faaar better though still far from great demon seed ok i'll be fair let's compare it to made for tv horror films don't go to sleep waaay creepier and better done salem's lot the night stalker night gallery even don't go in the basement or crowhaven farm were far better spoilers first of all for as good a scene as the bloody shower scene was you have a scene like the opening scene oh boy the garden hose comes alive to hose down some frisky teenagers terrible also just what we understand about the house it apparently needs to use its video cameras to see what is going on and it's a very emotional house not a spirit or demon or entity it's a house thats possessed but by what we are led to believe an inanimate object learned to love suzie margaret our protagonist now that i'm on the topic of suzie another scene that totally bothered me this poor old crazy lady comes tells you she was your nurse pours her heart out falls in the boiling pool struggling in agony for 45 seconds and what does margaret do does she risk her hands being burnt to save this poor elderly woman that came there to warn her's life no she stands there and watches the acting for the most part was better than average for a horror film but that's where the positives end for at least a more interesting and fun horror film about an inanimate object that kills people watch death bed the bed that eats i have a feeling the people who rated this so highly either haven't watched it since it originally aired or remembered it scaring them as children this film was pretty much merit less,0
watching smother was perhaps the longest not quite 90 minutes of my life there wasn't a laugh to be had in fact i don't remember ever cracking a smile diane keaton was horridly unfunny as a middle aged chain smoking dog hoarder the textbook overbearing mother character a relentlessly irritating woman who clearly suffers from some kind of personality disorder she is manipulative conniving melodramatic childish narcissistic and worst of all boring br br i suppose i should briefly mention the other characters but why bother it was just a long string of movie clichés the dippy socially inept distant relative who's just trying to break into the industry the gruff and long suffering but somehow still lovable father the mild mannered wife who just can't take it anymore but eventually moves beyond the discord and resignedly comes home the herd of unhousebroken dogs who like to chew throw pillows while everyone is away etc br br god what a snore i've never been a diane keaton fan and smother only reminded me why overacting is overacting no matter how many pictures you did in your prime her attempts at physical comedy were especially humiliating what was the director thinking br br while i like dax shepard and can even sometimes tolerate liv tyler their performances were so lackluster and dull that it was clear that neither actor gave a damn about this movie that was okay because neither did i keaton's endless self absorbed prattling was intolerable and at times shepard's dislike for her seemed genuine by the end of the movie i wanted to slap her myself br br awful,0
this movie is really nerve racking cliffhangin movie stallone was good as always michael rooker put on a surprising performance and john lithgow play a excellent villain the music is fantastic especially the theme the movie is action packed and never dull if you are a stallone fan then watch cliffhanger you won't be disappointed,1
of all the films i have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plot script and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his b movies but this is a sure w movie w waste br br take for example about two dozen fbi local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer inside the jeep is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds a huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet pellet ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed damn that guy is tough truly a miracle not since the six shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle,0
dolph lundgren stars as a templar who comes to new york when a key that unlocks the anti christ is found by an archaeologist of course the demon is only a couple miles behind dolph and isn't killed so easily as he transfers from body to body like fallen without the suspense of course lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable i admit to being a fan of dolph lundgren like steven seagal and jean claude van damme i try to watch his movies whenever they're on tv i caught the minion and boy was i ever disappointed this movie is utterly terrible with action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena worst of all is lundgren's woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of fallen which was good and end of days which was bad but better than this overall this movie is the worst movie i've seen from dolph lundgren it literally has nothing to recommend it it's awful and it's the lowest point in lundgren's career and i saw cover up the last warrior and masters of the universe br br 1 2 out of 4 awful,0
why in the world would someone make this piece of trash movie the first two zombie bloodbath movies were stupid enough but this takes the cake for the worst of the trilogy perhaps of all time todd sheets is still the director but no longer the screenwriter which isn't a negative or a positive considering he's just as untalented as the guy who wrote this one the writing is too heavily reliant on the f word which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times at nausea the acting is about on par with the last two bloodbath movies so naturally it's some of the worst i've ever seen the special effects are better than the last 2 but they still look godawful the plot has become too complicated for it's own good and was about some government experiment gone wrong and zombies being produced also featured is cryogenically frozen mutant zombie and school kids that know how to time travel leading to one of the most idiotic endings i've ever seen after the movie it goes to outtakes which is strange because this whole movie is an outtake only see this to make fun of it because if you go into this with a serious mind you might possibly kill yourself br br my rating bomb 95 mins,0
growing up joe strummer was a hero of mine but even i was left cold by this film for better and worse the future is unwritten is not a straightforward behind the music style documentary rather it is a biographical art film chock full of interviews performance footage home movies and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from animal farm the movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour br br the campfire format while touching in thought is actually pretty annoying in execution first off without titles its hard to even know who half of these interviewees are secondly who really needs to hear people like bono johnny depp and john cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man they were not relevant to strummer's life and their opinions add nothing to his story br br this picture is at it's best when strummer through taped interviews and conversation touches on facets of his life most people did not know about the suicide of his older brother coming to terms with the death of his parents the joy of fatherhood to me these were most moving because it showed joe strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face br br there have been better more straightforward documentaries about strummer and the clash westway vh1 legends and kurt loder's narrated mtv documentary from the early 90's come to mind joe strummer the future is unwritten is for diehards only,0
don't waste your time on this dreck as portrayed the characters have no redeeming values and watching them interact is sheer torture gothic was entertainment at least this is crap if you like watching pretentious and spoiled poets straining to outwit each other this may be right up your alley lord byron is portrayed as a complete jerk and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly bewildering mary shelly appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect what a waste of time see gothic instead i also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject matter but didn't catch the title i was hoping this was it but no such luck not recommended,0
let's see where to begin bad acting i'm not sure if i'd even call it that as it more along the lines of a no effort script read the actors didn't even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless sure there was a scene or two with nudity but that couldn't save this movie from it's lifeless characters br br to call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do the lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants br br budget did this movie even have a budget it seemed like they used less money than i've seen in a home shot youtube video bad lighting props poor sound post production bad special effects if you want to go so far as to call them that story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so but there was no life to this flick i don't care who directed it br br i've seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom don't waste your time or you'll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review check the ratings you'll see the 1's are rapidly outpacing the fluffed 10's with hardly anything in between wish i would have looked a little closer before wasting my time what a suck fest,0
probably the worst film i've ever seen the acting and story were terrible and i almost fell asleep the only good actor was colm meaney i had the impression to see the same scenes again and again until the end no emotion no charisma nothing,0
there seems to be little in the way of middle ground where watch on the rhine is concerned one either likes it very much applauding its sincerity its liberal point of view and fine acting or else loathes its obvious propaganda mediocre dialogue cardboard characters and overall tendentiousness i fall very much in the latter category and found the film and play concerning the activities of european refugees in washington during wartime a crushing bore worthwhile mostly for the acting and even then only intermittently that author lillian hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant her plays were written for people who shared her point of view and she seldom explored ideas that weren't already held by the author and audience except to point out how dreadful the other side is even when i find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she has to say as in rhine i still can't stand the way she says it her characters are unreal and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no real brilliance or originality she really had nothing new to say i thoroughly agree with the late mary mccarthy's long overdue dismantling of hellman reputation some years ago for those who think the theatre is dead or in extremis and yearn for the good old days i urge a peek at watch on the rhine as bad in its way as angels in america which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago,0
i'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars br br but they just don't understand the movie br br the story is about growing up in a difficult situation br br there is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren br br and there's good reason why so many critics like this movie br br and the reason is because they understand the movie br br i feel sorry for the low scores given by some people br br i wish i could just write a brief summary of a movie but imdb requires you to write 10 lines br br i frankly don't have anything else to say,1
i'm amazed how many comments on this show are about how real it is maybe i'm not part of the same universe because if veronica mars is anything it's over the top in a big way br br the acting is chewing the scenery with enthusiasm and the plots have holes you could drive a truck through that's not what i call real br br it is so earnest in its desire to be relevant that it only shows how cut off from reality rob thomas and his staff are br br overall i found it to be at best a snooze fest and at worst more than a little annoying kristen bell looks like she could be a good actress but it's hard to tell with the over the top style of the whole show,0
wendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller the film has some great drama between the characters and some good creepy scenes the acting is good the characters act like a normal family the wendigo effects are good the deer form reminded me a little of the rabbit in donnie darko br br the film sees a family going to stay at a house for a while but accidental hit a deer a group of hunters arrives and one of the hunters named otis starts to argue with the dad george after the car is lifted they drive off to the house the son miles is a little shook up about the deer but his parents try to tell him that it's natural for things like that to happen that night while he's in bed he starts to see weird things in bedroom the next day they go into to town and miles meets a man at the counter who gives him a little statue of the wendigo when miles shows kim the statue and tells her that a man at the counter gave it him the owner says the she only works there once returning home george takes his son sledding and while there sledding he's knocked off the board and miles is chases by the wind after gaining conciseness they go looking for george they find him outside the house where he tells them he was shot in the hospital kim tells the sheriff that otis may have shot him the shrieff goes to otis's place where he's bashed over the head with a hammer as otis drives down the road he finds that the wendigo is after him br br wendigo is a pretty good thriller that has some chilling moments check this out 10 10,1
i watched this with a growing sense of unease why would god in the shape of ian hunter help these particular people in their attempted escape from devils island and what was he doing there in the first place i mean i know god works in mysterious ways but helping thieves and murderers and prostitutes find redemption forgiveness and changes of heart in such a godforsaken location in any event it is hardly a likeable movie whatever gable had by way of charm is missing in this portrait of a thoroughly selfish man crawford is as endearing as ever she was i e to me not at all and the whole look of the film makes it seem as if it was made 10 years before compared to contemperaneous films like stagecoach and mr deeds goes to town this looks prehistoric,0
when you see this movie you begin to realise what a drastically under utilised asset the late dudley moore was there should be a dozen movies like this in our archive br br he was already top notch talent before he went to hollywood both as a comedian and a musician but mostly he is remembered for his pairing with peter cook on television and in one or two indifferent british movies perhaps the best of these was 'bedazzled' br br he always tended to be eclipsed by cook who's jealousy and meanness rifted their partnership and enabled moore to realise his true potential in america 'arthur' is the result br br this is a truly splendid movie moore's clownish comedy as a drunkard is undeniable the script is perfectly suited to his manner with lot's of hilarious almost surreal conversational digressions there is something so british about him that i'm actually surprised he found such an appeal to american tastes tommy cooper an anarchic comedian after the same fashion tended to draw a blank it is moore's almost childish vulnerability that is so endearing br br liza minelli and john guilgud tend to play straight roles against him but still have some excellent one liners john guilgud in particular delivers his with a sarcastic and acerbic authority that is a treasure to watch he invariably steals any scene in which he features and thoroughly deserved his oscar correct me if i'm wrong but he has never played any other comic role br br there is a follow up movie called 'arthur 2 on the rocks' it never attains the same sublime levels of fun that this one reaches but it is still rather good even so guilgud only gets a cameo appearance at the beginning and as a ghost it is darker and there is some interesting soul searching it will disappoint if you watch 'arthur' first br br hollywood seemed to loose interest in cuddly dudley after these two outings he eventually returned to britain dejected and apparently dying br br but 'arthur' is a sample of what might have been we can only imagine the other great movies he should have made br br your're sadly missed dudley,1
this movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that i've spent in a very very long time if you knew how often i went to the movies you'd probably say that's hard to imagine but never the less it's true after seeing the trailer for this movie i knew that i had to see it if you're a fan of horror mystery and suspense why wouldn't you the trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting unfortunately the movie is none of these br br from the cinematography to the script to the acting this movie is a complete flop if you're reading this planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills mystery action horror or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty five minutes i'm afraid you are in for disappointment br br why is it so bad you might be asking yourself let me tell you the movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful nothing about the movie made me the least bit on edge frightened or curious the script was at best laughable there were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous i began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasn't the acting was absolutely dreadful i like nicholas cage but this was a miss without exception every performance in this movie was incredibly below average the cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique finally the story is completely transparent you can see the end of this movie coming a mile away br br i am not usually a very harsh critic frankly when i go to see a comedy i want to laugh and when i go to see a mystery suspense horror i just want to be surprised this movie was boring poorly acted poorly written and an overwhelming disappointment do yourself a favor and go see something else,0
it's about time we see a movie that stays unbiased towards these old indian traditions at times it is clear how most of the 'doctors' are charlatans even lying about how they don't charge their clients while they are wearing their gold watches the 'donation' box is mandatory notice that there are only a couple of people who get 'cured' while we see quite a few cases br br keep in mind while watching that ingesting mercury is not toxic and that the smallest indian bank note is 5 rupee while the average salary in india is 1 700 ru month,0
generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending the acting was spectacular and the characters didn't stray from their persons i especially liked the plot although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie however i find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer extended maybe to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell for instance what happened to tristan's brother hayden for all we know he died in the hospital maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing who knows maybe there will be a sequel maybe if there is i cant wait to see it,1
went to wal mart and found this film on dvd and had no idea whether i made a bad purchase or a good one it is the later outcome to my viewing the entire film from beginning to end michelle rodriquez diana guzman bloodrayne '05 gave a great performance and her looks are beautiful sexy and at the same time a real study in the art of how acting is really performed diana did not like her home life and especially her own father for the abuse he gave her mother she decides to get boxing training in a local brooklyn gym and is not really well accepted by the male boxers in her high school there is plenty of friction between her female classmates and guys there is lots of action in the ladies bathroom and references as to private parts of guys if you like boxing and seeing a hot sexy gal do wonders in the ring and knock the boys on their you know what this is the film for you,1
no wonder pamela springsteen gave up acting to become a full time photographer it's a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one while this movie is not without its interesting elements mullets from hell etc it is outweighed by flaws for one thing angela the murderous counselor appears to be about the same age as the campers having an older more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film and then you have the murder scenes the budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly no pun intended although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is certainly original but overall there are a ton of movies out there that are scarier more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching,0
its like if you took the general themes of the usual suspects and fightclub take away all their style and class and mixed them together with a lot of pretentious new wave i'm intellectual so my movie must be hard to make sense of film maker rubbish mashed in a few extra styles for good measure chopped off the ending there you have revolver br br yes i did think about it for a little bit after watching and yes it did kind of make sense however that doesn't stop it being garbage br br waste of money waste of time br br up there as the worst movie i have ever seen with not even a bad movie novelty value to redeem it a little,0
the film is a collection of cliche's on just about anything out there it has no focus whatsoever no goals no real message symbolism is pushed over the top and stereotyping is abundant and outrageous this movie can't resist the temptation of making drama where non exists every small exchange of words turns immediately into a lengthy unjustified dialog that is so typical of an acting class rehearsal where there is no substance to this exchange the actors regardless of how good they are normally can't help but compensate with exaggerated emotion aka raising the stakes over acting to put it simply the directing is of no help here nothing can save this non story it is forced faked and boring to tears inaccuracies in portaraying punk rock with the who piercings and flashy 90's outfits characters wander without a role detail and motive locations are arbitrary this is boogie nights cum the good fellas cum saturday night fever with meaning and art ripped out br br good dp i'll give it that br br some films have flaws this film is lee's flaw he sold out like the rest of them became irrelevant he has nothing of interest to say anymore br br i have no desire to see anything again from this guy whom i'll refrain from naming from now on,0
i really didn't have high expectations and i must admit that i wasn't disappointed this movie is so terrible that i felt obligated to register an account here at imdb just to warn others not to waste their time the storyline is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie can it get any worse yes it can somehow they manage to make it worst by every minute and you end up thinking i want my 1 hour 35 minutes back somebody got to pay for this br br i dare you to find a movie which is worst that this br br i really didn't have high expectations and i must admit that i wasn't disappointed this movie is so terrible that i felt obligated to register an account here at imdb just to warn others not to waste their time the storyline is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie can it get any worse yes it can somehow they manage to make it worst by every minute and you end up thinking i want my 1 hour 35 minutes back somebody got to pay for this br br i dare you to find a movie which is worst that this,0
in this truly fascinating dark film a young impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money in return the devil takes his mirror image this is done brilliantly in the movie and eerily presaged when balduin the student is earlier practicing swordsmanship in front of the mirror a visual metaphor for a man at war with himself which portents his immediate future the student enjoys his money but the woman he loves is unattainable he has made a pact with the devil he is cut off forever from love and other riches of the soul you can have love or you can exchange your soul for money you cannot have both balduin is haunted by his double the intertitles express this beautifully as does the action some of the scenes are incredible the sense of doom when the devil disappears with balduin's mirror image is amazing as is the sense that his pact has forever cut him off from human society the scene where he runs away from his double and ends up in the 'wasteland' at the edge of the town no longer entirely human he has lost his soul he is like a hunted animal outside of human society there are so many other things to say about this incredible film paul wegener was an amazing actor and director a cultural hero of mine it helps if you know a bit about german history at the time this film was made and about german doppelganger tradition don't google it get a proper book just remember it's a very early film it's a little clumsy at times but considering what it has to say and it's tragic finale it's one of the best ever yes it is,1
the only explanation i can muster as to why this film isn't widely distributed is because it hits too close to home for some this movie was a genuine happy surprise the satire is genius this film turns the lights on in the dark that is organized religion and big media and the roaches scurry for cover rent the dvd and watch it for yourself if you haven't yet this film succeeds where many have failed dogma comes to mind to poke it's nose under the tent both by using humor and very clever analogies coupled with telling backdrops and locations can't comment in depth without revealing some significant spoilers there are some surprises in this film which even the seasoned film buff will be caught off guard by,1
this is an interesting idea gone bad the hidden meanings in art left as clues by a serial killer sounds intriguing but the execution in anamorph is excruciatingly slow and without much interest there is no other way to describe the film except boring the death clues are the only interesting part of anamorph everything connecting them is tedious willem dafoe gives a credible performance as the investigator but he has little to do with a script that is stretched to the limit several supporting character actors are wasted including peter stormare as the art expert james rebhorn as the police chief paul lazar as the medical examiner and most notably deborah harry who is featured on the back of the dvd case yet only has a couple lines spoken through a cracked door not recommended merk,0
as far as films go this is likable enough entertaining characters good dialogue interesting enough story i would have really quite liked it had i not been irritated immensely whilst watching at the utter disrespect it shows the city it is set in br br glasgow in scotland yet every character is english save for sean's girlfriend who is dutch scottish accents are heard only fleetingly in menial jobs roles as a scottish woman as a viewer who likes her real life films to be a bit more like real life i really don't think it would have hurt to use any one of the countless talented scottish actors or at least got english ones who could toss together a decent accent the futile attempt at using the word wee a few times did nothing but to further the insult,0
the clichéd polynesian males drink fight and make a stream of sexist stupid and unfunny remarks real life polynesians are much funnier than these stereotyped cardboard characters the supposedly samoan girl didn't look or act samoan at all seemed more like the stock white female who has sex with anyone on a whim with weak as water story lines you can't say anything about the acting even the most brilliant actors could do nothing with this script it's sad to see polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a film with not one good scene and only two or three 'jokes' what a waste of kiwi taxpayers' money what a lost opportunity to make a great film about a vibrant community it's better not to make movies if they're as bad and mindless as this,0
ever since i was eight years old i have been a big wrestling fan it didn't matter what federation i watched wwe wcw uswa to me the action is all i watched it for br br may 23rd 1999 that was my 19 birthday i ordered over the edge and i was just expecting another pay per view but this time i was wrong instead that was the night one of the best wrestlers to come out of canada a true human being fell to his death due to a stunt gone wrong not much you can do to change the situation but what happened affter owens death made me very mad br br rather then ending the pay per view and doing the right thing as human beings the wwe decided to protect what comes first and that was the money by keeping the pay per view going as if owens death never happened br br i gotta tell you vince mchmaon has made some stupid decisions in his life but this was by far the stupidest decision he ever made br br and this crap with saying owen would have wanted the pay pew view to keep going give me a break when someone dies on a pay pew view its comon sense to stop it thats like a police officer shooting a robber or a mugger with a run and then just leaving the man to die so he can go home and call it a day as if the mans life never mattered br br but no matter what happens owen will be missed and thanks for the memories for all the times you gave us,0
while i count myself as a fan of the babylon 5 television series the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there the pace of the gathering is slow the makeup somewhat inadequate and the plot confusing worse the characterization in the premiere episode is poor although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems i remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series,0
spoilers br br i was blown away by this movie i've been renting on movielink for a bit and decided to check this movie out alot of boxing movies seem to overblow the blood in this movie it shows it at the amature level though i do wish that perhaps more attention would have been brought to perhaps her improving her grades the movie points out the problems some families face with gender br br i was a bit concerned with the ending but the ending wasn't a disappointment either br br i think it was pretty clear by the title that she'd win what was unexpected was that the two of them got back together sort of at the end br br loved the score for some of the scenes highly recommended br br 10 10 br br quality 9 10 br br entertainment 10 10 br br replayable 10 10,1
guy ritchie's noble effort is beat up knocked down raped kicked around shot stabbed spit upon punched sodomized and abused and left for dead by madonna's dreadful performance her acting was very reminiscent of a graduate from the al gore school of dramatics and public speaking guy ritchie did do a somewhat noble attempt to remake this and if you exclude all of the scenes that his wife was in it's a fair movie at best i think that the best acting job ever had to be guy comforting his wife that her performance was good enough not to re shoot if you have an opportunity of watching swept away or clipping your toenails for 89 minutes go for the extended pedicure,0
dark remains is a home run plain and simple the film is full of creepy visuals and scares' that will make the most seasoned horror veteran jump straight out of there seat the staircase scene in particular these guys are good although they weren't working on a huge budget everything looks good and the actors come through dark remains does have one of those interpretive endings which may be a negative for some but i guess it makes you think cheri christian and greg thompson are spot on as the grieving couple trying to rebuild there lives' however some side characters like the sheriff didn't convince me they aren't all that important anyways i give dark remains a perfect ten rating for being ten times scarier than any recent studio ghost story japanese remake,1
well they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied i don't know if stella james sean young qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men she's still exploring trying to find more data so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now i can't agree however with anyone who says young is too old for the role if she is we should all age so nicely for the most part this film left me cold though it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see and unlike the recent 'eyes wide shut ' at least something happens in this one,0
closer to reality and containing more depth than breakdance stan lathan's beat street is still a pretty dull show again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother all growing up in queens new york each has their own unique talent one is a hustler one a d j another an artist who creates 'burners' while little bro' lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer br br lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day br br choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes but this alone is not enough to lift beat street to greater heights unfortunately the film really falls flat late on after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting br br sunday august 25 1996 video,0
i went to see this movie with my 17 y o daughter i insisted we go the matinée showing not because i'm a tightwad but just feeling i had in the nascar spirit this is a sponser's dream so much blatant advertising it almost qualifies as an info mercial if it weren't for the so called acting keeping with tradition the herbie franchise continues with its cheesy story lines the car is only a 'vehicle' no pun intended for this cornball of a motion picture earlier herbie installments although cheesy as well were produced during more serious times making them a little easier to digest ms lohan disney's reigning drama queen has little acting ability i was surprised that mr keaton and mr dillon would get involved in such a project only the snack bar was a bigger ripoff,0
i could not agree less with the rating that was given to this movie and i believe this is a sample of how short minded most of spectators are all over the world really are you forgetting that cinema used to be a kind of art before some tycoons tried to make it only entertainment this movie is not entertainment at least not that easy entertainment you get on movies like titanic or gladiator it has style it is different it is shocking that's why most of you have hated it so much because it does not try to be pleasing to you it's just a story a very weird one i admit but after all only a weird story it is not a great story not even a great cinema work but i believe it is worth a 7 stars rating only for the courage of both author and director to shot a story that is not made to please the audience thus selling billions of copies and making the big studios even richer this movie is for me european artistic like movie made in the us and everyone involved in the making of it deserves respect be it for the courage or be it for the unique sense of humor,1
good for an evening's entertainment but the plot was unconvincing garrison's affair with the first lady was unreal and passionless the president was a cardboard cut out and who were the real villains anyway nothing was developed or explained sufficiently i still don't know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole got involved the villains were nameless and undeveloped so you never felt involved in their plot michael douglas and kiefer sutherland did their best to inject some reality into the story the chase and confrontation were good but kim basinger and eva longoria were both unbelievable in their roles basinger totally lacked character and no way could longoria have been a secret service agent this could have been a very good film but somehow it missed the way with too many unanswered questions disappointing on the whole despite some very good scenes and did they use the 'west wing' set for the white house scenes i kept expecting cj or charlie to appear,1
oh well this movie starts off well it's kinda funny and seems like it could be a fun movie then it becomes a bit serious and goes off the rails it sort of wants to be 'boogie nights' but it can't achieve it if only it stayed with the tone of the first quarter of the film,0
this film is pretty poor the acting is abysmal and completely forced furthermore by shooting the film as a docudrama doesn't necessarily make it more believable you can't get out of it that easily mr dir don't let my comments mislead you however as i would recommend you watch this film as it does shed some light on the psychology or non existent psychology behind the perpetrators of such crimes however the climax of the film is absolutely rubbish there is no other way to put it it pure and simply fails to capture any sense of atmosphere what takes place does not translate to me any feelings of desperation panic fear or dread that one would surely experience in such terrifying circumstances no instead it leaves you with jaw dropping was that it spilling from your tongue and by no means are you haunted by these boys actions rather you just feel embarrassed for yet another film that started with potential but ended up falling flat on its face at the most crucial point zero day indeed zzzzzzzzzzzzz,0
i went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son he seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and i did the writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar disney excursion in fact i had a very hard time paying attention at all the movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that i was hoping my son would fall asleep so i could pick him up and walk out br br not to say that the film isn't an interesting concept it's just told so oddly bad screenplay especially when we meet the family for the first time i know we're supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord they could've shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes seemingly i didn't actually time it by that point i was scratching my head looking for an exit,0
this film is a very funny film the violence is bad the acting is well dani stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do the random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually frustrated goth lads in personally i think this movie really does suck the story and characters could be very good if say the directing the actors and other little nibby things were made better but the film is just bad the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has danni in it this film is possibly the worst b rate film ever and believe me that's hard to achieve especially when you're competing with def by temptation and over crappy excuses for serious horror movies i'm not a cof fan and so i just see this as another rubbish movie a really bad one if dani made this as a comedy then good going him very well done over than that though i rate it low for it's crappiness watch it when you're in a happy happy joy joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you're high on multiple different types of drugs,0
tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years no grant character transformations no hollywood ingredients just life and a little bit of magic the balance in speed in weirdness in comedy vs drama is perfectly weighed this film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how nice it was the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied the fact that this film is about nothing merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining it is brilliant because it is empty in between the lines it is happening to see or not to see that's the,1
i really have to disagree with guy yardley rees who should he have watched the entire film would have seen some absolutely stunning scottish scenery some of the best ever shot in skye and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant whole br br this is not a big budget film rather it is a film that has a strong community feel br br i can't say how much 'standard' films bore me pushing out the same polished stuff again and again seachd doesn't seem to be about that at all it really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more gaelic than any recent scottish film br br ok so the acting isn't in the style a blockbuster that's because the actors are seemingly real people i actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing and at times unusually beautiful br br seachd really bears a second viewing since there are many threads that become clearer second time around that really do feed into the ending br br overall the combination of music and at times stunning visuals plus a community approach to the acting and non normal structure has turned seachd into quite a distinctive and memorable film more of these please,1
this is not really a proper review since i did not see most of the film i stopped watching it the film is very violent with nasty drug dealers and street punks but that is not why i stopped watching br br here was the problem i watched just enough to be introduced to several characters all of whom were not interesting everyone was a tedious despicable psychopath with no engaging personalities giving me nothing to look forward to i found myself not the least bit curious about what they would do next or what might happen to them br br if there had been even one person of interest and i don't mean good or nice person i mean an interesting person i could have stayed with it watch state of grace to see what i mean in that film the gary oldman character is a complete lunatic but he is very interesting al pacino perhaps did a good job in scarface but his character just did not engage me,0
it has been said that deanna durbin invented teenagery this first film was one of the best the humorous story presented a delightful 14 year old deanna a little beauty with a gorgeous voice as the miss fixit in a family split by divorce for plot summary see other imdb entries but quickly deanna and her two older sisters plan to go to america from switzerland to prevent their father from remarrying with an excellent supporting cast especially barbara read and nan grey as the sisters good direction and editing the film succeeds in captivating one even on subsequent viewings of deanna's three songs only il bacio is from the classical repertoire but when she sings it in that police station scene the film's place in history is assured at least it was for this viewer who at the age of 15 was smitten for life with both deanna and classical music one of the many nice touches that occur throughout three smart girls is the brief glimpse of the drunk stretching his neck for a final glimpse of deanna as the cops hustle him by one unfortunate result of the success of this film was that subsequent writers for durbin vehicles became locked into the miss fixit theme which quickly became stale deanna herself never did her stature as an actress is more questionable than her charisma which she certainly had it seems to me that like many another film personality she substituted naturalness for the histrionic ability that she lacked the ploy worked well for 21 feature films,1
this film's kind of like conan the barabarian but with more sex rape and murder there is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers don't do a good job showing it which is a shame because it 'could' be a decent story richard hill gives a solid performance in the lead role as does the villain who sadly didn't appear in anything else of note the fight scenes aren't too bad either i love the way deathstalker lets his sword 'drink' the blood of his victims and there's plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout br br all in all not good but not necessarily that bad either,0
a slick romanticizing of the sexual exploitation of neworleans black women by white men of power and privilege ooh does that whet your appetite well then belly up to a vhs or dvd and gorge on this gratuitous trolling through a seamy segment of history for good measure it's adapted from the book by celebrated hack anne rice the directing is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheesy dialog most of acting is amateurish the production's sole worthwhile note is that it employed practically a dozen black actors all of whom have scarcely been in employed in today's market jasmine guy ben vereen pam grier eartha kitt including some faces that have barely been seen at all bianca lawson rachel cuttrell it also is despite itself a sterling showcase for nicole lyn the pompous and ponderous james earl jones is on hand as well so is the late ossie davis a minimal talent who owes his success to having been affiliated with the legendary negro ensemble company this film should be rated t for tripe,0
every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror diamonds are crafted and one becomes completely awestruck by its sheer brilliance this is no less than a diamond this is a film brimful of eeriness chilling anticipation and dark atmosphere and i think it's safe to say one of my favourite horror films of all time and of course it contains probably the single most flat out scary sequence in the whole of history of horror every time i see the film and it gets up to the point where you know the inevitably will happen i try to remember exactly when i will be frightened out of my wits but it never fails to happen i never get it right and i find myself as terrorized as the first time i saw it now it must be said to scare a jaded horror fan like that that is nothing short of pure perfection unlike the americans the brits know their subtleties they take pride in the art of acting they do not need any special effect in order to convey atmosphere they rely on the power of the potent story and the creepiness in this case of suggestion and anticipation every single element is impeccable from the set pieces the acting the story to the menacing atmosphere pauline moran surely could make the devil whimper that's for sure as an end note if you for some demented reason don't like this piece of insanity then you honestly don't know what horror is all about and frankly do not deserve to know it either thank you,1
this is bar none the most hilarious movie i have ever seen beginning with the four delinquents being sent off by their fathers to wienberg military academy a tone is set that steadily continues all throughout this goofball film and it does not let up for a second br br it's tough trying to describe this film the humor elements are so spot on and brilliantly concieved that upon a first look it appears as nothing more than a stupid 80's teen lust comedy but it is oh so much more than that fresh from the minds of those folks over at mad magazine up the academy serves up a formula and style that i have never since seen duplicated by any of the funniest offerings to come out of hollywood in years past basically the film is so full of infantile cornball material that you might guess that the writers were a couple of 14 year olds themselves see this movie if you love to act immature a classic,1
lloyd bridges as mike nelson and his boat were all the stars of this series what made it so good to me when i watched it was the real feel of going underwater the show exhibits a youthful energy energy for exploration under water which is infectious br br the show was educational as well showing the viewer things about scuba diving from someone who appeared to be a consummate pro mike nelson there were excellent shows and the program always appeared to be well produced granted the drama in the scripts sometimes hit the same notes in more than 1 episode but each show holds it's own with any other show produced during this era the infancy of american television,1
this movie is not about entertainment or not even a movie you want to see to pass the time this movie is a genuinely a display of true love that can only come from god one cannot help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie we have several dimensions of love that contributes to the value of this movie there is the divine love of god that is beautifully portrayed god's love transcends the heart and mind and endures and is eternal there is the love in a marriage while the main character grapples with his wife's disease he realizes through god's love that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine he knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated finally you have the love of child and parent the kids in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear dear friends love is not love unless it comes from god because god is love and love comes from god talk to someone and let them know you love them love does no good unless it is given to another i pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it amen,1
i have always been a fan of david lynch and with this film lynch proved to critics that he has the talent style and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that he's become known for in the past decade as much as the film is g rated it's pure lynch in style pacing and tone the film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power br br the cinematography is terrific as is to be expected from a lynch film and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking it's also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either good or evil br br richard farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast most notably sissy spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher and harry dean stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role br br with this film david lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80's with 'blue velvet' and 'the elephant man' critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as 'twin peaks fire walk with me' and 'lost highway' but with this film he showed that there was method to fwwm and lh and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film 'mulholland drive' considering the high praise it's received and the oscar nomination for lynch br br 'straight story' is to me one of the most moving motion pictures i've ever seen it's a loving story about family friendship and the kindness of strangers i would highly recommend it,1
basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970's classic kitsch horror 'death line' which ironically was like this cobblers also partly filmed at the disused aldwych underground station br br making good use of the now disused jubilee line platforms at charing cross as well as the aforementioned aldwych this film contains basically the same plot dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnels preying on the lost passengers who have missed the last train originality is not this film's strong point br br indeed strong points are sadly lacking the gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the sub gollum nutter is never really fully explained as seems little more than an under developed plot device br br franke polente has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnels and scream every so often indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film out acted by a small dog and a pack of tame rats br br if creepy films set on the london underground are your bag or you just want to play 'spot the tube location' them pick this up on dvd when it hits a bargain bin if you are looking for classic horror go and dig up a copy of death line aka raw meat br br if you are looking for a quality well written and acted film you will need to change trains,0
i found the fbi story considerably entertaining and suitably upbeat for my new years day holiday viewing its drama and action packed episodes were thrilling the hardesty character was well drawn and admirable overall the photography script and direction was perfectly creditable rather than taking the film to be a repugnant piece of propaganda as some might i enjoyed it as a well mounted portrayal of the necessity of ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime again the depiction of a family holding together even under the strain of the husband's commitment to his arguably important work i did not find to be a twee representation but an ideal and exemplary one,1
if you've read mother night and enjoyed it so much as i did that you just have to see the movie understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of vonngut's writing that beyond his story lies vonnegut himself and that you can't put a human mind on the screen his whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance i believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that vonnegut poses in his book but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen does this mean that the movie misses the mark of course not in my opinion the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page it succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of america's true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense i've seen other movie versions of vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel vonnegut's genius and loses grip on his own craft i would not place this movie as one of the best i've seen but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching by taking vonnegut's voice out of the movie's narration or trying to insert it however it can mother night tells his story brilliantly and preserves the story's fundamental lessons without confusion distraction or disappointment,1
i recently bought this movie and i do not regret having it at all as a matter of fact i am very please have this movie to add to my collection matt manfredi and phil hay movie directors took less than one month to film and spent about 1 million eur to produce this great movie this proves that not only big productions make great movies br br the title of this movie fits in perfectly in computer language bug means program error which causes reactions in computer function our reactions can cause these negative side effects but also great moments of beauty the vertiginous happenings in this movie start with the death of a bug a man witnesses the crime on the other side of the road from there onwards everything gets complicated br br i point out john carrol lynch fargo wallece the man who cannot make everything right at all,1
this is one fine movie i can watch it any time rauol julia gave an outstanding performance we lost him too soon richard dryfus is a great talent only thing it needed more of was dana delany what a babe,1
i can fondly remember bo derek's heyday and the uk press attention the mucky sun news of the world papers especially all following her small role in 10 with dudley moore understandably much fuss was made of her photogenic face crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly formed bouncing breasts br br unfortunately acting is and never was her forte i think they should make one of the triple disc collections you always find in the bargain dvd bins orca tarzan the ape man and bolero all these films could be nominated for the so bad they are great br br it would be a guilty must buy of mine should you ever read your press or this comment ms derek please do not be offended always had a soft spot for you and there are more important things going on in the world to worry about than your acting ability much love x,0
for me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding franks fanatasies when he is travelling with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings the problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasies funny situations again and again and again it is to predictable it is more done as a tv story where you can go away and come back without missing anything br br i like felix herngren as frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to it's audience br br,0
if you can make it thru classic meyer titles intro you can wade thru anything but would you want to i did not find a lot there to dig my teeth into i suppose if you go into it with low enuff expectations you will be delighted a la charlie's angels but for my money i'd like a little something more more visual more moving more i feel like i'm begging for gruel the foot of the master the mans got the goods but he just won't share,0
first some background i am english and have lived in london all my life i have been to many games at 'the den' and most other london club grounds i am familiar with the type of person who gets into hooliganism and i know just how they act and how they speak have to say this is a bad bad movie i can tell you that green street is one of the most unrealistic movies i have ever seen i spent most of the movie cringing with embarrassment i felt i should write a mini review because i felt i needed to point out a few things br br a people just don't talk like that in london in real life the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it sound stupid unfortunately hooligan types do exist but those you see in green street are more like parodies b the actor who plays pete dunham charlie hunnam unfortunately sounded about as 'english' or 'cockney' as osama bin laden he's from up north in newcastle and i'm just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him how are we supposed to take him seriously why they didn't just get someone from east london to play that part is beyond me i could have done 'a bang up job' myself hehe c mr frodo i mean how can i be expected to take seriously elijah wood kicking the ass of people twice his size and who are genuinely nasty hooligans he'd be dead simple as that honestly as a brit it was hard to watch this film i'm pretty sure this film will bomb here in the uk it may do a little better in the states because the americans just wont know or care how inaccurate it is br br please my american and foreign friends don't believe a word of this nonsense yes these firms do exist but it's all extremely underground and hush hush and on a vastly smaller scale the movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed some of it in london usually they try to film these things in cardiff wales or something and expect us all not to notice,0
handsome and dashing british airline pilot george taylor a solid portrayal by guiseppe pambieri gets beat up by thugs after a wild night in hong kong george meets and falls in love with the sweet and virginal dr emy wong a fine and charming performance by the lovely chai lee george regains his health and goes back to work when emy fails to hear from george for a lengthy amount of time she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute while director co writer bitto albertini does indeed deliver a satisfying amount of the expected tasty nudity and steamy soft core sex this film is anything but your routine wallow in leering sleaze instead it's a surprisingly thoughtful touching and tragic love story between two well drawn and highly appealing characters chai as emy wong is especially radiant and endearing the picture starts out bubbly and cheerful but the tone radically shifts into a more grim and harsh mood about two thirds of the way through emy's descent into vice after she falsely assumes that george has abandoned her is bleak and upsetting ditto the remarkably sad and heartbreaking surprise bummer ending granted the narrative is certainly melodramatic but never too silly or trashy moreover the sex scenes are quite tasteful and even genuinely erotic notorious italian porn star ilona staller has a nice sizable supporting part as george's jealous and uninhibited secretary helen miller guido mancori's polished cinematography offers many strikingly gorgeous shots of the exotic locations nico fidenco's funky throbbing score hits the groovy spot worth a look for those seeking something different,1
i love horror movies that brings out a real amount of mystery like say silent hill which i found to be quite good but still was missing something and movies that keeps you guessing this i thought was one of those movies at first the movie starts out with some really good suspense and builds up a good starting point for a good horror scene but after that it just rolls down the hill and from there it only goes faster and faster down i mentioned silent hill at first for a reason because i can see a lot of stolen themes from that movie in here all in all i would say watch silent hill instead of this one its better its more scary it has a lot more suspense and also the ending is a lot better and best of all you wont feel ripped off as i did with this one this just seems to be one of those i like that movie so i'm gonna re make it in my own really bad version kinda movie oh and one more thing lordi in a horror movie thats like trying to scare a kid with a care bear who has hug me and i will love you forever written on the stomach of it,0
like watching a neighbor's summer camp home movies indian summer is a sleep inducing bore eight alumni campers are barely introduced when unbelievably boring flashbacks begin for characters we know nothing about fine actors alan arkin and bill paxton are totally wasted in this film one camper's observation that everything seems so much smaller than i remember it is repeated at least ten times enough to make you squirm the anticipated pranks are neither funny or original unless you think that short sheeting is a real howler this movie was a great disappointment considering the ample talent involved indian summer did not make me homesick just sick merk,0
this will be best known for the ferrari that was crashed when eddie griffin was doing promotion br br tale of racing and betting is a poorly made by the numbers that appears to have a director who couldn't see the numbers largely a point and shoot affair with a group of actors in it for a paycheck this is not a good movie but its not bad enough to be watchable and end up as a some what nothing film isn't worth bothering with no matter how you look at it br br misogynistic despite the fact one of the leads is a woman this is a film that was clearly made just to get the producer and director close to pretty girls want evidence there are long lingering shots of women in next to nothing that serve no purpose other than perhaps to get a rise out of people too afraid to rent a porno or the sports illustrated swimsuit dvd br br avoid this movie at all costs,0
while it does crack the odd good joke the humour is generally quite dry with members of the panel frequently pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokes br br unlike what an other comment says i don't think this is the best rte have ever made its really dry and sarcastic sarcasm is the lowest form of wit there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud people seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which aren't really that good overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often it can be fairly mediocre its not as good as jasper carrot or dave allens stuff i find benny hill funnier,0
it is a pleasure to see such creativity on tv again this show is poetic artistic and good fun the characters relate well and the writing is not bad i think it will improve as they get their legs definitely worth a look br br the girls steal the show so far in this series chuck is adorable as is olive the two aunts are a delight i sincerely hope they write them into bigger parts as they are magic br br well that's all the news that is fit to print go make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun in an old fashioned way this is like dr seuss for adults,1
definitely not worth the rental but if you catch it on cable you'll be pleasantly surprised by the cameos iman's appearance is especially self deprecating it's also an opportunity to watch all the male supporting cast members from the sopranos typecast themselves,0

jungle fever is too highly stylized stereotyped and comes across as essentially dishonest wesley snipes was wrong for the lead and there was no chemistry between him and annabella sciorra even though there's plenty of talent in this movie it's mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to little more than decorative cameos also instead of simply showing racism for the ugly and stupid thing it is spike lee chooses to wave it around like a flag in a most whining and irritating manner i made it through most of the film but i couldn't quite finish it and that for me rarely happens,0
teresa pavlinek was a popular member of the toronto second city cast she has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in canada finally someone has the sense to create a show for her the supporting case seems quite good too i have now watched the pilot several times and i still find it refreshing though i am not sure why the show is listed as the jane show 2004 i might be wrong but as far as i am aware the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on global tv in canada in early 2006 it is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well too bad this couldn't be paired up with corner gas now i know corner gas is on ctv but the two shows would be great companion pieces,1
having read the reviews for this film i understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good however this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time the majority of reviews that i had read said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow and whilst some parts do leave you confused the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you've missed so much it's not like lock stock or snatch in the sense that it isn't that funny in fact it's pretty dark and it is a lot more intelligent in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints and in one of the best scenes of the film jason statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself the way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned is that it is full of memorable characters specifically statham who gives a fantastic performance as the lead and ray liotta who spends most of the film in speedos but gives a great performance none the less if you've got time and have time afterwards to think about the film and even watch it again you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film i think it's fantastic and that guy ritchie is a director on top of his game,1
a damsel in distress is a delight because of the great gershwin songs fred astaire joan fontaine and a terrific supporting cast headed by gracie allen and george burns br br typically silly plot for an astaire film has him as an american dance star in england with burns as his publicist and allen his secretary they concoct a story about his being a love bug with women falling victim to him left and right he runs into fontaine who is being held captive in her castle by a domineering aunt and docile father silly plot br br the great songs include a foggy day things are looking up nice work if you can get it and i can't be bothered now fontaine does not sing but does a brief and decent number with astaire surprisingly good in a few dance numbers with astaire are burns and allen including an inventive and fun romp through an amusement park br br also in the cast are reginald gardiner constance collier montagu love harry watson as albert ray noble and my favorite jan duggan as the lead madrigal singer br br jan duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio who sings nice work if you can get it her facial expressions are hilarious she was also a scene stealer in the w c fields comedy the old fashioned way playing cleopatra pepperday br br much abuse has been heaped on this film because of the absence of ginger rogers who as noted elsewhere would have been hideously miscast the tcm host notes that ruby keeler and jessie matthews were considered yikes two more would be disasters fontaine is fine as alyce and the dynamic allows the musical numbers to belong to astaire with ample comic relief by burns and allen br br fun film great songs good cast and jan duggan in a rare spotlight,1
ok this movie could have been soooo good all generations have been exposed to thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie the craft themselves and tracey island were realistically transferred to the big screen whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with sophia miles was simply fantastic as lady p and bill paxton whilst not exactly who i envisaged jeff tracey being was solid enough but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machines br br it's not so much the fact that the movie was centred around the children that made me feel like jonathon frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film it was the fact that alan tracey was so obnoxious in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brothers who were at least 19 20 seriously these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the case br br the film didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical it tried to pay homage whilst satirising and it just generally fell flat on its face 3 10 2 for the machines 1 for lady p,0

i got to see an early preview of this movie and i hope they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it before it comes out aug 3rd it stars andy samberg from saturday night live as 'hot' rod kimble he's plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father when we meet him he's jumping a mail truck on his mo ped yes a mo ped and almost makes it this would be worthy of a 'jackass' movie if he wasn't honestly trying to do this isla fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl next door denise she seems to like rod enough to join his 'crew' jorma taccone also snl plays his half brother kevin who documents the stunts with a camcorder sissy spacek plays rod's mom marie she remarried frank powell played by ian mcshane frank's a real tough guy who enjoys beating rod in some real drag out brawls it's clear that rod's not going to earn frank's respect till he can beat him we find out frank needs a 50 000 heart transplant and rod is determined to raise the money just so he 'can beat his ass' once he's healed and prove himself a man a long fall down a mountain side convinces rod to 'go big' on one stunt rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life like the human torch at a children's birthday party there were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts just when all hope and money is lost along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses rod wants to jump he gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle the whole town turns out and the world tunes in does he make the jump does he get the girl do they raise the 50k does frank get his ass beat by rod wait till this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out,0

i grew up watching scooby and have been a fan forever this cartoon moves away from the same old routine that can get boring to viewers the crooks in mask routine gets old and this cartoon is a change from that it's not meant to replace the scooby gang it's just a break from the same old crime scene for both viewers and writers i'm sure the cartoon's focus is on scooby and shaggy who inherits a large sum of money and use that money to thwart world conquest plans from a mad scientist and his goons small homages of the gang and the gang themselves are featured from time to time if you are a fan of scooby doo you can still appreciate the bond between a boy and his talking dog along with the jokes that come with it just enjoythe cartoon and support the creators writers and producers so that this won't be the last scooby cartoon,1
this is the only david zucker movie that does not spoof anything the first of its kind the funniest movie of 98 with night at the roxbury right behind but i did not think theres something about mary was funny so that doesnt count except for the frank and beans thing he he dont listen to the critics especially roger ebert he does not know solid entertainment just look at his reviews anyway see it you wont be dissapionted,1

while watching this movie i got sick i have been grewing up with pippi and every time was a real pleasure when my wife came to sweden she was looking at the oldies and had a real good laugh but this american version should be renamed and never be shown again it is terrible from beginning to it's end how can they manage to make it soo bad well i guess someone blames the translation ha ha ha but they are never close to pippi may this movie never been seen again and never sent out on a broadcast burn the movie and save the kids if you want to look at pippi then look at the original movie and have a good laugh we love pippi inger nilsson sorry tami erin you will never stand up to be pippi oh yes when read the spoilers explanation 'spoiling' a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film well i guess the director stands for this you are looking at this movie at your own risk it is really a waste of time,0
i remember watching this is its original airing in 1962 as a five or six year old and really enjoying this i recently had the opportunity to watch it again for the first time since then as it was aired on walt disney presents on the disney channel i'd forgotten most of it and some of it was geared towards kids but it was still enjoyable i can't wait to show it to my niece and nephews,1
i'm not going to approach and critique the theories of raw i mean this is a site about movies and whether the movie delivers or is well made and not a site debating philosophy br br having said that this video really blows it's one talking head shot of raw after another some of it is archival video so you can see how he has aged over the years and that's pretty cool but otherwise the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous br br it's a strange comparison but i kept thinking of the sunday afternoon when i watched some of the barbra streisand star vehicle funny lady another really bad movie after a while i was so od'd on barbra i kept wishing there would be one scene that she wouldn't appear in you know a meanwhile other characters in the movie were up to something else moment but it was all about barbra well this video is raw's funny lady br br so if your idea of a good time is to look at multiple takes and angles of the face of raw while he prattles on with his theories assembled in a lame structure that doesn't add any interest or insight then be my guest for me i couldn't take it after 20 minutes,0
a simple comment br br what can i say this is a wonderful film that i can watch over and over it is definitely one of the top ten comedies made with a great cast jack lemmon and walter matthau wording a perfect script by neil simon based on his play br br it is real to life situation done perfectly if you have digital cable one gets the menu on bottom of screen to give what is on it usually gives this film stars but in reality it deserves stars if you really watch this film one can tell that it will be as funny and fresh a hundred years from now,1
a friend clearly with no taste or class suggested i take a look at the work of ron atkins if this is representative of his oeuvre i never want to see anything else by him it is amateurish self indulgent criminally shoddy and self indulgent rubbish the whore mangler of the title is an angry low budget filmmaker who murders a bunch of hookers there is a little nudity and some erections but no single element could possibly save this from the hangman's noose the lighting is appalling the dialog is puerile and mostly shouted and the direction is clueless i saw a doco on american exploitation filmmakers during the recent fangoria convention atkins was one of those featured he spoke like there was something important about his work but after a viewing of this i see nothing of any import whatsoever there is no style either and the horrible video effects like solarization only enhance the amateurishness not even so bad it's fun avoid,0
the father of the who's alcoholic drummer keith moon was named arthur i found so many similarities between dudley moore and keith moon in this movie liza minelli who usually overacts did quite a good job in this one and was able to turn cheek on dudley moore in every turn yes i agree sir john stole absolutely every scene it was a very different movie enabling the viewer to have a glimpse into another life we often try to catch a rerun of this movie on satellite god rest dudley moore this was such an enjoyable movie much satire and thumbs down to the rich and snobby affluent the close friendship between moore and sir john is rather endearing,1
it's difficult to put into words the almost seething hatred i have of this film but i'll try br br every other word was an expletive the sex scenes were uncomfortable drugs were rampant and stereotyping was beyond the norm if not offensive to italian americans br br i'm not saying the acting was terrible because leguizamo sorvino brody espisito et al performed well but almost every character in the film i despised not since the bonfire of the vanities have i disliked every character on screen,0
joe don baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there he was alright in goldeneye and made a pretty good bond villan in the living daylights and has appeared in various other movies one thing he can't do is carry a movie as the lead which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in malta joe don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to italy but some guys cause the plane to set down in malta and the killer gets away the rest of the movie is seeing joe don chase the killer here and there joe don getting taken into custody various times joe don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on the movie is quite bad and you won't find yourself exactly pulling for joe don's character you will be amazed at how many times joe don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be the crowning part of the movie comes when joe don chases the killer all over malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around malta this movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever,0
this film was seen by my wife and i when it came out in 1978 it was a revelation to us we actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children obviously we were wrong love may come from where you don't expect it and maybe don't want it but we both chose that love anyway br br and no it never changed our sexual orientation that kind of stuff is for the christian wackos br br when we were young we both had affairs but never with the opposite sex as we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs br br this story is not far fetched however the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me my wife and i have been sleeping together for the last 40 years we are still gay end of story,1
warning minor spoilers br br i ran into this one partway through and watched from there not knowing what it was or what the plot was it certainly held my attention i didn't know until the ending that it was based on a true story the guy she used to do the dirty deed came out looking like a seriously nice guy who just got his head twisted around by a devious girl i have to question how true to life that portrayal is anyone who would murder a husband and wife as they slept just can't be entirely nice still i did have some sympathy for him as he had been set up and taken advantage of that much was made clear br br my main complaint is with the ending here comes the biggest spoiler skip this paragraph if you don't want to learn it a few minutes before it ended there seemed no way for the truth to be discovered the way it got discovered was in a sting operation but my question is how did the police get convinced to go along with it the movie didn't show us that and it seemed a bit too convenient absent the explanation of how they were persuaded to do it br br i think the way they handled that was done for dramatic purposes as the omission of the explanation lent an aura of suspense to the crucial scene which otherwise wouldn't have been there we would already have known what the scene was about and what was going on with brad in it br br otherwise this is a pretty good film i give it 7 10 it made me think now i'm interested to find out the facts of the real case br br one more thing the movie was done in 1996 some of the reviews here seem to be treating it as a more recent movie br br p s meadow sisto is lovely i hadn't seen her before she can act a little too always a plus in her line of work lol,1
this would have been so much fun to see in a theater back in 1996 there is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste which really appreciates really well done shocker movies br br the dentist is panned sometimes probably because people usually have strong feelings over dental matters maybe the ada launched a campaign against it since dentists report they have to apologize for this movie and for the marathon man which only has one scene comparable to the many in the dentist br br it's amazing to note that according to the trivia page the movie was shot in 21 days of course post production can take longer than movie shooting sometimes and the editing for the dentist is picture perfect the quick cuts heighten the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist takes care of his wife there's only two quick cuts showing what is happening the rest is left to our very fertile imaginations corbin bernsen was a good choice for the role since he has lots of experience playing psychologically off characters and he completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist br br for me the pacing of the movie was just right the film makers reveal the wife's naughtiness in just the right way all of the characters in the dental office look like they are actual people working in a real office there's lots of tension while they are dealing with impatient people awaiting the dentist's arrival meanwhile the dentist is off on the cusp of a huge psychotic breakdown unlike so many movies of this genre the script is very very tight all the victims fall into the dentist's trap in very calculated ways two law enforcement types even get involved in a little subplot that ends up creating a shocker of a showdown near the end br br definitely not for the faint of heart or the dental phobic but a real roller coaster ride and heavily recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests,1
this is the worst movie i have seen since i know who killed me with lindsey lohan br br after watching this movie i can assure you that nothing but frustration and disappointment await you should you choose to go see this hey tim burton i used to be a big fan of yours did you even screen this movie i mean seriously what the f k br br without giving anything away here is the story in a vague nutshell nine wakes up he does stuff his actions and decisions are irrelevant and the movie ends oh wait here comes a spoiler br br spoiler alert spoiler alert at the end of the movie it rains i think a part of my soul died while watching this movie,0
what a snore fest br br of all the bits of nostalgia that hollywood has decided to remake and update this is by far one of the most pointless this was a totally pointless show in the first place and we really don't need a 'modern' update br br never mind the bigotry and sexism inherent in the system from the beginning so many advances have been made socially since the show ran that the entire point of the show if it ever had one has been lost br br also what is the point of having a character named boss hogg if he's not overweight,0
i have seen it i like it melissa plays her part well it was actually believable my brother in law saw it with my sister i and when i mentioned to my sister that i forgot it was based on a true story i had seen it a few years ago he said just because its on lifetime you think its true both my sister i were like it was so anyway i was wondering if anyone knew what murder it was or like who was really involved was because i want to prove it to him i love lifetime movies especially the ones that are true or just the ones that teach a good lesson i thought i saw something about it a week ago but i cant remember where any help would be appreciated,1
how can a movie with amy posey and raechel have nothing funny in it believe it or not 'house bunny' did this better and funnier hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got some money this movie is an embarrassment to all of them it is a cliché from beginning to end clichés can work well with a script or at least an idea this movie does nothing but use cliché after cliché rather than ideas or script it uses the preexisting persona's of the actresses rather than develop characters bad sad and rubbish now i apparently have to have ten lines of text for a comment really why as an it ops manager this is another example of sloppy coding,0
semana santa or angel of death is a very weak movie mira sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in people mira has an italian accent which falters from time to time couldn't she just speak english all the other characters have a forced mexican english accent which is distracting the dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden the cinematography looks nice but that's not enough to save this tripe this next part of this review does contain spoilers br br during the climax it looks like the villain is going to get away but then he comes back down stairs to get shot and do a cool stunt down the railing that just shows this script has no originality whatsoever avoid,0
here is what happened br br 1 head of bbc3 needs to make programmes aimed at different audience to bbc1 and bbc2 to keep licence and job br br 2 lenny henry offers his unfunny friends up br br 3 head of bbc3 snaps them up completely ignoring the fact that they are not funny br br worst of all it is arguably racist as all the characters play up to bad stereotypes if a white person did this kind of thing there'd be uproar br br trash,0
after reading the other reviews for this film i am of the opinion that the high markers are probably paid studio lackeys as the film i saw was absolutely dire with wooden acting lacklustre scripting and plodding predictable directing one of the few plus points has to be the stunning scenery as this film features some stunning backdrops with great sweeping vistas and dramatic skies and wide open prairies sadly when the most memorable thing in a film is the part featured behind the actors this has to be a warning sign as to the quality of the movie all in all a thoroughly uninspiring addition to the western genre which even at the very reasonable price it can be obtained on dvd is best to avoid,0
i don't have much to say about this movie it could have been a wonderful tour de force for peter sellers but it is one of the most tragic misfires in movie history that it was sellers final movie makes it all the more painful br br the terrible screenplay direction and shockingly wooden performances all come dreadfully together to make this one of the most unwatchably awful movies ever made br br i wish so much that i could find even a snicker or a chuckle buried somewhere in this pile of putrid blubber but it's a lifeless humorless disaster the truth hurts br br peter why couldn't you have stopped at being there,0
a top notch columbo from beginning to end i particularly like the interaction between columbo and the killer ruth gordon br br as an avid columbo fan i can't recall another one in which he doesn't set up the killer at the end as he does in other episodes in this one as he's trying to determine the correct sequence of the boxes and the message that the nephew left behind it finally dawns on him br br the music in this episode is very good as well as it is in many of other ones,1
you like to solve mysteries you like complex narrations this is for you brilliant clever movie by francis leclerc son of a legendary french canadian signer felix leclerc flashy photo and clever editing is the word of leclerc strongly helped by roy dupuis who's dythirambic in the lead role br br the plot is about alexandre tourneur veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer's sufferings on the road throughout the struggling he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him br br not spooky but very mysterious and well played movie i have my hypothesis on the ending i think the indian caused the accident but this ending was open to any explanations br br i strongly recommend it 9 5 10,1
this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen i saw it at the premiere at sxsw and was extremely disappointed the director knew little about john lennon and even said as much at the premiere this is a drama but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was that's never a good sign the only saving graces were dominic monaghan and jason leonard as livien's roommates bandmates they were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously the cheesy dropping of beatles lyrics was just absurd the soundtrack was excellent however and was probably the best part of the movie unless you're one of those crazy rabid dominic monaghan fans don't bother with this one,0
i hadn't laughed this hard for a movie in a really long time the garbage that hollywood has been putting out lately drives me up a wall this one was definetely fresh and witty if you look at the demographic figures for the ratings only a few women have voted i don't want to ruin the movie for you but i'm sure that every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave it a poor score why because the movie puts men in their place that's why if more women vote for this movie because of its actual humor value and not because it is damaging to men it could easily be a 7 rated movie,1
grey gardens is shocking amusing sad and mesmerizing i watched in amazement as ediths jr and sr bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past their existence in a dilapidated mansion which they had not left for more than fifteen years is both a comedy and a tragedy this is a film you will not soon forget,1
i married a japanese woman 14 years ago we're still together br br however in the 1950's it would never have been as easy br br life in the military had been mined for action drama and comedy for years by this point mined to death the mixed relationships gave it new ground to cover this is old hat today but then marrying an asian back then meant you either owed somebody something or you were a freak of some sort this touched on both possibilities along with the third maybe it is love br br brando did his usual good job garner did a better job than he usually does he's good but this showed how good he could be umecki chan had a helluva debut here and while i think she earned her statue she didn't really stretch it was a role that no one who hadn't been overseas would have recognized and the newness was the corker br br the real scene stealer was red buttons red was the best thing in this film bank on it and the japanese lifestyles were shown in an admirable light as well br br a classic,1
the godfather citizen kane star wars goodfellas none of the above compare to the complex brilliance of the sopranos each and every character has layers upon layers of absolute verity completely and utterly three dimensional we care about tony soprano wholeheartedly despite the fact that in the simplest model of good vs evil he is evil soprano is the most provocative intricate and fascinating protagonist ever created to this point in history if you're in the mood to be overtly challenged as a viewer and to be forever altered on your feelings toward entertainment watch the sopranos i defy anybody to sit down and watch the very first episode of season 1 and not want to continue with the series each season is completely brilliant in its own way dvds are essential to anybody's collection of out 4,1
really excellent movie one of the best i've seen touching and simple just like life sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and it's just beautiful not too much of anything just as it's suppose to be really loved the idea of the movie noone is bad or good all or just people sometimes make mistakes mostly because of society's pressure everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that you don't have reasons to get angry you can do it but eventually the anger goes away and then you to need to let love come back in although it's hard there lies the true happiness br br great actors and cast the movie really gets you into the feeling of the movie br br nice nice nice br br i recommend to see it especially if you like to see italians' life,1

i guess that this movie is based on some kind of a true story it's about two young girls who molest a grown man for 48hrs i don't see where the terror comes into play here there are some weird' and surreal sequences in the movie and the two girls sandra locke and ah oh well play the roll of two psycho man haters to the hilt they do a pretty good job although some of it is just a tad over the top the movie's not good and it's not horrible it's just really really dated i mean this thing is dripping with the 70's it's not really bad if you like that sort of thing you know that thang,0
this movie is using cinematography fantastically the depth of the camera catches each character denzel washington and kevin kline put on awesome performances though washingtons accent does die in certain scenes how is this movie laying forgotten unable to rent nor hire in recent times it threatens to be lost forever a worrying idea attenborough at his best since ghandi this master piece stands for what it should in movies such as these no worrying about gaining audiences rather a cry for freedom in the south african apartheid though critised for the biased nature the movie is faithful to the book by donald woods and faithful to the message intended to express to the world ta and peace,1
this is one of them movies that has a awesome video box but has wired camra work and unknown actors that speak with bad dialogue its so dark when the killings happen you can hardly see it plus the movie is hard to understand the only star in this is wcw s vanessa sanchez tygres in wcw before it folded and she is a good actress i like low budget film especialy ones that has errors because they are fun to watch but severed unfourtunatly isn t one of them this movie is ok to see if you like voodoo and severed heads but this is no blockbuster but if you need something new to watch then rent severed,0
with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene the movie plays much like a dream and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices the film works isn't trying to work as history but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies br br i would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever and there is a wild imagination in its style i can completely understand why people would hate it but i give it 9 10,1
i can see the guys doing the budget preparation for this flick well lets see now we spend 50 getting dirk benidict cause battle star galactic and the a team were cool the we spend 40 making a demon costume never mind that the demon is supposed to be incorporeal in the script and we spend the rest making the movie this was pretty bad and very cliche have a loved one present when watching or bring a good book,0
as has been noted this formula has been filmed several times most recently as you've got mail with tom hanks and meg trout pout ryan of the several versions this is my least favorite the problem i think is that the studio coasted on the stars charisma which doesn't quite cut it here br br the chemistry betwixt the two leads never comes to a boil in this movie there are no real sparks van johnson and judy garland remind me of day old donuts pleasant but bland and when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow judy in particular is disappointing she looks like she has no neck i don't know if she was having trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it's head into it's shell all hunched up and everything i couldn't figure out what van johnson was getting so hot about i would have made a bee line for that cute violin player and van wasn't great either i've always thought of him as a rather generic hollywood leading man and he doesn't do anything to dispel that image here br br if you're a fan of the stars or the early 1900's then you might like this movie but there are a lot more entertaining romantic comedies out there and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale confection,0
vivah is in my book the best movie of 2006 period in my book it is one of the best 100 movies ever made in bollywood its sad that this movie doesn't have that many reviews and isn't having that much popularity br br vivah is once again a true achievement from a director who does it again after hahk and maine pyar kiya sooraj has once again pulled off a brilliant one vivah br br this is the most simple and cute movies that i've seen this year after seeing don 2 which was crap and later dhoom 2 which even beat don in that matter i finally see a movie which is so close to my heart and my culture br br i don't know why bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture which we have and are making hollywood remake style crap movies like dhoom 2 and don br br the story is beautiful and relates much to the indian system of arranged marriage which i too would like to be a part of our system which teaches us to obey elders follow them and of course obey their thoughts is so brilliantly shown in this movie of course there isn't any force in choosing your life partner and it should be a brief meeting between the couple and its up to them to decide as it is brilliantly shown in this movie br br coming back to the movie vivah is a story of journey between the beautiful period of engagement and marriage the phase where the guy meets the girl both understand each other both try to assess if they could love each other for seven generations as our system says and the various which occur during marriages br br amrita rao is brilliant in the movie shahid is ok and alok nath and anupam kher are awesome the songs are brilliant i especially like the hamari shaadi main hafte reh gye chaar and do anjaane ajnabi br br overall a must see for anyone who still believes in the indian culture and tradition and i certainly do br br go see this movie i just have to say one word br br bliss,1
resident evil code veronica is a great well made video game it has great graphics very comfortable controls a great storyline and high fun factor the storyline to this is claire redfield gets taken to an island for trespassing on umbrella grounds and reaking havoc at they're main lab while looking for her brother code veronica's graphics are very good the fire and rain effects are great looking the controls are comfy but the button pattern doesnt fit the dreamcast control makeing it hard to get used to its still fun going around some wierd disturbing place shooting the guts out of zombies code veronica also has a little bit of romance between the two main characters you also get to play as chris redfield from resident evil 1 the sound in this game is better than ever for example even though i hate the new feature when the giant spiders crawl they're feet make a disturbing scampering sound and the guns sound alot more realistic great graphics outstanding story comfy controls and realistic sound makes resident evil code veronica a definite loved i give it a 10 out of 10,1
i had never heard of this flick despite the connection to george clooney whose company produced and he appears in a very funny supporting bit and his ocean's 11 director steven soderbergh worse we picked this up in a discount bin for 4 99 canadian dollars at that what a grand and pleasant surprise but then i'm of the opinion that if william h macy is in it you can't be disappointed this was very reminiscent of those ealing comedies from england in the 1950s ok with more profanity this is an oddball and at times gut splittingly funny film the actual heist made me laugh so hard i was crying perhaps the funniest use of underpants in movie history maybe it was the low expectations i had going in but i watched with a group of people and we had a blast best 5 i've spent in ages,1
i wondered why john wood was not playing dr falken until i watched the film bad plot bad science bad acting and overall a bad film please don't watch this film rent the original war games if you are feeling nostalgic br br i didn't like the bending of the plot to beat the terrorist threat idea either in the first film w o p r was built because russia had 1000s of warheads pointed at the u s a in this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat politics aside one of the good thing about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end no such insight is offered in this film,0
i feel totally ripped off someone needs to refund the 4 95 i spent at blockbuster to rent this homemade mess this is not a musical it is a complete waste of time and my evening what i don't get is why did this get distributed in the first place somebody must have been doing some heavy drugs the night that deal was made i've seen better films come out of film schools and i have been to film school so i can say that as a fact the quality of this work is also just so very bad to view shot on dv nuff said the songs are not songs but just banter that sounds the same in every section want to see a good musical then don't rent this movie,0
not many movies were made about the lighter than air lta aspect of aviation but this is one of them and it's damn good just a fun film to watch br br most of the movie takes place at the navy blimp operations at nas lakehurst with nas tustin playing the role wallace beery plays a likable but munchausen like senior chief ned trumpet an enlisted pilot whose tall tales have gotten so frequent nobody really believes him half the fun is near the end of the movie when events start proving that most of his more outlandish tales are actually true br br set during wwii the main plot centers around bachelor trumpet wooing a local widow only to end up having a father son relationship with the widow's crippled son jess told he would never walk without crutches by doctors chief trumpet pulls some strings and a navy flight surgeon helps in restoring the lad's crippled leg jess goes on to join the navy to become a flight officer flying blimps back at lakehurst and facing a whole new set of challenges br br a very well done movie albeit not without some corny hollywood dialogue slipping past the technical advisers and beery's apparent inability to march in step otherwise this movie gets good grades for technical accuracy and gives a rare look into the navy's lta operations the cash register scene an exchange between trumpet and jess's future love interest cathy is an absolute hoot,1
why can't this type of compact entertaining mystery be filmed in the new century it keeps the viewer thinking and guessing all the way the cast is a great ensemble william powell exhibits true star quality who knows perhaps he was rehearsing for his future as nick charles he is a joy to watch one also can see why eugene pallette made more than 200 films he is a great supporting character actor and his excellent chemistry with powell is fun to watch mary astor does above average work in a not very meaty role all other hands chip in to make this a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend 73 minutes i suspect michael curtiz had a ball directing his one bravo,1
adrian has just gone out of the asylum being rich and with no parents his life seems empty one day he meets gonzalo a poor boy whom mother is prostitute desperate for earning some money gonzalo helps adrian to search about his life and who where his parents this is a movie from a new director and it is perfectly clear in most of the film scenes not correctly directed dialogues a little forced some incoherences in the script anyway the ending is unexpectedly well done well just a little and that saves a little the film actors are known and with great quality nevertheless they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting all of them have done better papers in other film the film results boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking how much time will pass until it ends of course there are lots of worse films but sure there are many many better ones,0
thanks to the bbc for this show i used to suffer from an inferiority complex i hated leaving the house talking to new people and i had an overwhelming sense that people hated me however after watching one episode of 4 non blondes my fortunes started to change after episode 2 i started applying for new jobs wearing fashionable clothes and i actually felt talented when the series had finished i was running the sales department at work banging a plethora of women and frequently won the karaoke competition down my local if you ever have a confidence crisis and don't know where to turn then take a trip down to poundland and pick up the dvd it's only 99p,0
my friends and i rented this from blockbuster because we saw nana visitor's name on the box this movie is a travesty i hope she negates from her cv br br the plot was lose and flaccid the acting was mostly dry and unbearable in some parts the movie made no sense whatsoever the rough plot of an alien parasite species that infects humans has been done many times by films with much better scripts than this for example invasion of the body snatchers and the faculty br br if you ever have the misfortune to come across this movie i suggest you burn it br br how it classes itself as a horror movie when there was no use of fear suspense gore terror or any of the usual horror film techniques i don't know however if you still find yourself wanting to watch this film i suggest you have a lot of sugar before hand so you can find parts of it funny,0
cause it's crap the kind of movie that makes you want to go and smack the movie maker and say why horrible camera work count the times the camera tries to remain steady on one person and can't the dialog is ridiculous the acting is comical it looks like they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible i'd bet 10 they used home video cameras to make this either that or most of the cameramen were drunk truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie if you ever want to host a worst movie party bring this one want more entertainment stare at a wall,0
i have to be 100 honest with you fellow imdb users i wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster doesn't charlotte gainsbourg looks extremely sexy and charming smiling that way i'm in love with that woman i got what i expected but only half this film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations br br while i don't agree with another fellow imdb user who states that the movie is overrated i must admit that préte moi ta main has plenty of flaws br br my main problem with the film is the lack of on screen chemistry between the main characters there isn't a single scene previous to the climax that shows the main characters sharing a moment of romance or even a clue to suggest that they're interested in each other br br in fact the only scene were both share a moment is tremendously awkward when both are in the couch and does not help the audience understand about a possible love interest i didn't buy the dinner sequence br br still the movie delivers very funny moments and has a strong dialogs that support such an ingenuous premise i mean with ingenuous that it would be very difficult to execute such a farse by a 43 year old man in these days br br i understand it's a movie and that's why i accept it as a funny situation plus the humor is versatile there are moments involving s m funny lines with chabat's best friend some lesbian references funny situations involving the family women and more br br charlotte gaionsbourg's performance is top notch and she's by far the reason to watch the movie she's funny sexy looks very thin and fine and demonstrates she's a versatile and talented actress who can pull out a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance br br alain chabat is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance i think the supporting cast do what they can br br the score art direction and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the film br br those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be pleased after the ending credits it's a good example of feel good cinema,1
footlight parade is fascinating on so many levels there is no way the supposedly staged theater prologues could have been produced in any theater on earth of course think of the huge pools and three story tall fountains for by a waterfall for instance berkeley directed john garfield in they made me a criminal six years later and had the dead end kids singing by a waterfall as they took their showers br br shanghai lil is the best production number in the picture it's a catalog of '30s warner bros sensibilities note the african guys mixed into the scene with white and asian prostitutes you would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others i also get a thrill when the military dancers do a card section presentation of roosevelt's image there's also the nra eagle the logo of the controversial national recovery administration of the new deal fdr was the new president and hopes were so high that he'd pull the nation out of the depression you'd never see something so working class oriented coming out of mgm of course warner bros wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the f d r administration br br dear little miss ruby keeler was never better than she is playing the chinese hooker lil she hardly even watches her feet as she dances which was one of her signature flaws br br the pre code stuff is fun the by a waterfall number is wonderful in that regard the girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through times square with all its lights on the spread eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for 35 years in a few months the production code would eliminate such naughty pleasures,1
an art house maven's dream overrated overpraised overdone a pretentious melange that not only did not deserve best picture of 1951 on its own merits it was dwarfed by the competition from the start place in the sun detective story streetcar named desire abbott and costello meet the invisible man you name it if it came out in '51 it's better than this arthouse crapola the closing ballet is claptrap for the intellectual crowd out of place and in the wrong movie few actors in their time were less capable at acting or less charismatic than kelly and caron my 12 worst of '51 i saw 201 movies and among the 5 worst best picture oscar winners,0
one of the ten best comedies ever br br this seems a comedy so joyous and light that sings keaton's comedies are innerly harmoniously intelligently ordered thought br br wonderfully amusing deliberately delightful and inventive three ages should belong to a draft of a comedies top ten if i were to sketch one a threefold love story will enchant the viewers i want to bring here this approachkeaton's comedy is like lang's destiny upsidedownor À rebours again a couple traverses the waters of timeand of epochsin the stone age in rome and in keaton's timesin a mohammedan country in renaissance italy and in china the same device works in the both moviesone a grim eerie melodrama the other a light virtuouslypaced comedy at keaton it's essentially the same couple and maybe the same is with lang the babe desired by both buster and beery is nice i have found three ages well written and smart without being ostentatiously sophisticated the plot is basically very popeyelikethe babe is a piece of furniture the only protagonists are the two male rivalskeaton and beery br br keaton's movie is simply enormously likable and perhaps one would be tempted to assert this looks like ambitious funyet it's not but it is grand fun large fun ample fun and wallace beery makes a fine nemesis,1
all i can say is before watching the movie i did not have a hint indication who annemarie schwarzenbach was or what was her life story and i have to confess that the movie was hardly a help to reach these data and even it was not successful to persuade me to do some research by typing few words on google website however all i can say is that the actress jeanette hain was great with her mute facial expression she really played well and showed a deep depression mental status as it is in real br br after all based on the script the movie has happened in turkey and tehran as well as afghanistan but believe me i am familiar with the area it was all about an arabic desert in morocco turkish people and persian people are completely different in face and culture as well as in language which is not arabic br br i suppose for making a film like this documentary type a thorough research about all these minor elements is mandatory,0
it seemed as though the year 1984 was anything but the orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with george orwell's science fiction novel 1984 turned out to be one of the happiest times in american history the upsurge in the economy and a reemergence in basic american values cultivated an idealistic aura of resumed innocence which was viewed by the american people with a very auspicious disposition there have been many ersatz renditions of classic movies in the past but the originals are almost always considered superior purple rain is such a movie in this category made in 1984 purple rain provided a doggerel of eighties happy go lucky quality music which they incorporated into the making of this excellent film certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed classics screwball comedies neon accented clothing and of course the music eighties music is considered by experts to be the best decade for music in american history set in minneapolis purple rain accommodated the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city when i was a little kid i lived in minneapolis for about eight months back then the non white population was under 3 by 1984 african americans had made some in roads into minneapolis and thus they established a firmly embedded culture of their own as well the movie purple rain evokes an eighties style clothing and music ensemble which effortlessly captivated the movie audience i loved the music to purple rain and the innovative approach this film takes to confrontational success is indeed brilliant see this movie if you have not seen it already prince became an eighties icon with this masterpiece for a short time he dated kim bassinger he must be doing something right purple rain put prince on the map this film gets my emphatically assertive verdict of thumbs up,1
i think that this movie is very neat you eithier like michael jackson or you don't but if you like him then you have to see this movie i think that it is a very neat film with great song play and good imagination not to mention the film center piece smooth criminal which has some of the best dancing you will every see,1
the third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear it is a political film more than a plain entertainment jason bourne will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures he was submitted to in order to kill his old identity he really killed some one who became his corpse but the film is finally revealing that all this had been organized and planned by the cia within a blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aiming at eliminating all american citizens who tried to prevent the control of the whole society by an established and limited group of people who was one essential officer of the cia up to 1980 when he became vice president that goes along with what is being said on the internet then the truth will come thanks to jason bourne himself but the main person who will be able to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision concerning the cia is a woman and that woman gets the senate involved in a general investigation a woman and the senate read my lips in the usa politics are fought in the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign it is music and the cinema right now hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia academia and intellectuals are using the cinema in general and this film in particular to build up the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the senate so go and watch the film it is pretty entertaining and it has the sweet fragrance of the end of a period and of the great change some are expecting and others are waiting for but no one is able to pretend it won't come the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines,1
i do agree that though this story by melville just might be unfilmable this isn't even a credible try to move the story into the 20th century just outrages the original story's intent and nature possibly you might have been able to move it over to england but it must be a period piece even our story narrator the proprietor tells it in a flashback going back even further somewhere around 1800 towards the end of the 19th century a strangely disobedient worker would be discarded without a thought and the 20th century come on give me an expletive deleted break even around 1800 such behavior didn't work very well in view of the ending and the movie's ending i don't know what it was because i didn't watch the entire travesty i had to stop this was like setting streetcar named desire in elizabethan england,0
it's only 2 episodes into a 5 part drama but i can already state that this is one of the best things i've ever seen that's on tv silver screen or even in real life br br as a writer it's so good it's almost demoralising as a viewer it's so entertaining that i'm annoyed the episodes are over a fortnight instead of monday to friday it's clear that all these negatives are actually positives br br i'm a modern guy who previously turned over from tv dramas in comparison to movies tv dramas always seemed to be dated quite tame and well generally boring five days has really brought tv drama into the 21st century so for me at least it's mind changing go watch it,1
forget credibility br br you must not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an endless string of unbelievable feats being trodden upon in the process but recovering at lightning speed and transforming innocuous gadgets in lethal weapons especially when renny harlin is directing br br cliffhanger is no exception but the movie has numerous assets breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed stunning special and visual effects the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film excellent musical score welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension and a solid cast two heroes stallone star and cowriter has the lion's share of the footage but the excellent michael rooker more than stands his ground a charming heroin janine turner and one of the most darstardy bunch of villains ever priceless john lithgow and deceivingly feminine caroline goodall but also rex linn in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it leon craig fairbrass good solid entertainment then if no credibility as roger ebert wrote about another film it's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much br br,1
wow this is the worst movie ever the only reason i signed up for imdb was so i could complain about this movie i have never walked out of a theater or stoped a dvd but i almost stopped this one and i should have but i watched it all the way to the end just to get let down again with an absolutely terrible ending wow if this is all that wes craven can produce his time is long up i've never seen the first one and will never after watching this its terrible acting with a terrible plot hey looks someone is shinning a mirror at us lets go check it out and the sad part is that when this movie came to dvd it was completely checked out at blockbuster forever so i feel bad for all the people that saw this junk,0
without question one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s gaots seems to really really want to be something important the tragic truth is that it's so entirely valueless on every level that one can't help but laugh reaching in desperation for the earthy elements of ingmar bergman's films it follows a city couple's day in the wilderness they walk along a shady path allthewhile pontificating like a u c berkeley coffee clatch almost every line of tarradiddle dialog delivered here is uproariously bad i feel that life itself is made up of as many tiny compartments as this pomegranate but is it as beautiful after what seems like an eternity of absolutely nothing happening well ok we are treated to some nudity and a tepid soft sex scene there is finally a very anticlimactic confrontation involving a pair 'nam vets who are making the nature scene and performing some pretty harsh folk ballads with an acoustic guitar br br nothing at all eventful or interesting happens in this entire film i thought the larry buchanan picture strawberries need rain was a weak example of a bergman homage golden apples is every bit as bad but the ceaseless random verbiage it presents makes it memorably awful 1 10,0
why did i go to see this film honestly because jim carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter so do you really blame me for expecting that again additionally the premise the funny trailer his co star jennifer aniston's involvement and the fact it was a massive hit stateside encouraged me br br however as my one line summary suggests i was disappointed for various reasons br br reason 1 it wasn't funny in a 2hour movie i laughed for about 5 10minutes all together the rest of the time i sat thinking i really should have got some ice cream i admit that maybe it is wrong to judge jim carrey on his previous films but what does he really expect when he makes gem's such as 'the truman show' 'liar liar' 'me myself and irene' 'dumb and dumber' 'the mask' and the 'ace ventura' films then produces in bruce nolan's own words such a mediocre film br br reason 2 jennifer aniston's role was criminally underwritten i mean hello she's been around in the public eye for about ten years now and in this film she gets about four lines to say wrong br br reason 3 one word cliché br br reason 4 a casual deployment of specifically american references jimmy hoffa walter cronkite 'sweeps week' is a clue to the film's specifically home grown appeal a teenager says no to drugs and yes to an education that's a miracle want to see a miracle soon be the miracle god tells bruce a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the us but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety additionally i still go to school and that statement suggests me and all of my friend's are miracles or maybe it just means we have brains br br in this film there are enough funny carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent bruce almighty from being a total calamity but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards,0
don't be swayed by the naysayers this is a wonderfully spooky film this was a thesis project for the writer director jt petty he did a great job of having me on the edge of my seat i never really knew what to expect and for a jaded horror movie goer this is nirvana the film concerns an elderly man who lives in a isolated log cabin in the woods one day while searching for his cat in the woods he witnesses the murder of a child or does he he agonizes about this the rest of the film what is most unusual about this film is that here is no dialogue until the last few scenes i found this to be intriguing the writer manages to get hold of your senses and gives them a relentless tug give this film a go you won't be disappointed,1
i saw this movie when i was in israel for the summer my hebrew is not fluent so the subtitles were very useful i didn't feel lost at any point in the movie you tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutes br br this movie blew me away it depicts two of the most prominent taboos in the middle east today a homosexual relationship between an israeli and a palestinian it allows a person to enter both realms of the conflict simultaneously the dilemma the emotions entailed the movie climaxes in tragedy when anger and rage drive one of the lovers to one extremist side an absolute must see,1
it might not be the best movie of 2006 but it was a just a movie to excite and to think about the sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as in the line of fire and the manchurian candidate the basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this a plot to kill the president of the united states michael douglas stars as secret service agent pete garrison who spearheads the operation only to find out later that he has been framed kiefer sutherland co stars as a sort of rival by the name of david breckinridge and eva longoria as jill marin who is a rookie agent going under the guidance of agent breckinridge and academy award winner kim basinger as first lady sarah ballentine one improvement for this movie could have been more action as it is by some sources considered just as much an action film as is a thriller film but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the us president it also concerns a mole traitor in the secret service who is leading the president in the wrong direction,1
new york i love you just like its predecessor paris je t'aime is a compound of various stories that reflects the different kinds and aspects of love but unlike it the rhythm is much faster and the stories much shorter the movie offers a unique view of the city of new york with its various and different landscapes new york i love you offers a first class cast featuring such great actors like shia labeouf natalie portman ian mckellen hayden christensen chistina rcci and orlando bloom ethan hawke james caan and robin wright penn among others and some excellent writers and directors like brett ratner and anthony mingella,1
i'm surprised this movie is rated so highly although if i were to go with typical grade scale 71 is a c or d so perhaps that's all right but this movie was just a typical thriller except boringly slow and unrealistic not that a typical thriller is realistic but this one seemed to be trying to and yet the woman who got rapped didn't press charges because she didn't want to be cross examined in a court even though she would be putting the man who broke her arm beat the crap out of her and raped her away for life not but also protecting the lawyer whom she had feelings for and his family not just random people she didn't even know there were other similar problems with the movie which would have been all right if there was some kind of moral to take away from the movie but the few moral questions like whether it was right to try to kill beat kady before he did anything illegal were presented a little one sided since kady ended up being just a crazed bastard bent on revenge so sure the lawyer was justified in protecting his family since waiting for kady to actually rape his daughter so he could do something legally about it would be a bit absurd so now i've just waisted more of my life for this stupid movie so please don't see it so at least your life won't be waisted and that way my 2 1 2 hours or so has meant something,0
some amusing humor some that falls flat some decent acting some that is quite atrocious this movie is simply hit and miss guaranteed to amuse 12 year old boys more than any other niche br br the child actors in the movie are just unfunny when you are making a family comedy that does tend to be a problem beverly d'angelo rises above the material to give a funny and dare i say it human performance in the midst of this mediocrity,0
not to be confused with the british black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994 but this shallow grave is a worthy addition to the 80's backwoods slasher br br the plot goes 4 sorority girls from a convent are planning the spring break of a lifetime in florida but they're plans are put on hold when one of them witness a man murdering a local woman and when he realizes that he was seen well let's just say it becomes a deadly game of cat and mouse and things get even worse when he turns out to be the local sheriff br br shallow grave in my opinion is one of the more enjoyable slashers that came out in the 80's especially the late 80's which was when the slashers kinda went downhill this was one of the few that didn't and this movie should be more well known it's a pity it isn't this is one film that actually confounds stereotypes just try guessing who the final girl is going to be i got it totally wrong the principle cast are all likable and it's one of those movies that you kinda hope they all get away which of course they don't this coupled with the fluffiness of the film's first half an hour jars in a good way with some flashes of real nastiness the second murder provides a real jolt and some unexpected sleaziness even though this isn't a high budget thriller i didn't expect the topless scene where a woman is strangled with her own bra accompanied by a hysterical religious radio broadcast in a film from this late in the 80's br br there are one or two bad things about this movie well not bad just minor like the sub plot with the two teenage boys which doesn't go anywhere and the ending which was stupid and plus the deputy inability to follow logic there aren't any sharp implements in shallow grave but to my mind at least it's a slasher flick through and through the scenes where the girls are hunted through the woods by the malevolent sheriff are tense and exciting br br all in all a very enjoyable and worthwhile slasher with great performances from all four of the main girls and that psycho sheriff,1
bottom of the barrel unimaginative and practically unwatchable remake of the road warrior this film follows the exact plot as the filipino film stryker and is worse by far bad acting dialog effects dubbing pacing action sequences the list goes on and on italy made literally dozens of road warrior rip offs in the early 80's some good some bad this is the worst by far no contest not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half there was 1 one good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding but everything else about this movie seriously reeks for actual post nuke fun go track down a copy of endgame after the fall of new york or escape from the bronx instead they're much more enjoyable than this rubbish,0
if this film had a budget of 20 million i'd just like to know where the money went a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really really cool on an original play station 1 game and early pc games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made what puzzles me is where did the money go pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa 1975 83 and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing or ruining in this case for about the same 20 million this is quite possibly the worst film ever made i would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again i hated it completely i regress i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan 9 or killer tomatoes or santa claus conquers the martians these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them you love them there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it i sold it to a guy for a dollar i'm betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew shame on you pendragon films i want my money back,0
according to the director this movie was popular in asia it is somewhat difficult to take these mats helge movies seriously since most of his films are shot on a very tight budget almost no usd at all but it is fascinating to establish that mats helge eventually completes something which can be called an action movie the ninja mission is i think the best one among all movies directed by him some special effects are quite enjoyable this is not a b or c movie it is a z movie but an enjoyable and fun z movie,1
eddie izzard is nothing short of a comedic genius and this is eddie at his very best his material is extremely witty and hilarious and his delivery is some of the best ever witnessed on stage instead of insulting the audience's intelligence he relies on it to draw humor from his wardrobe preferences hitler the moon landing and the british with so many memorable laughs one can't help but repeat some of his lines forever more do you have a flag should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine every fan of top notch standup comedy needs to see dress to kill by far the best british standup comedian i've ever witnessed eddie izzard has struggled for success off of the live stage however his lack of commercial success in film should not be indicative of how extremely talented he genuinely is dress to kill is a treasure one that luckily has found its way to home video and can and should be enjoyed again and again,1
i like monster movies generally even if they are implausible and silly but its hard to like this movie when its so implausible and silly and tries to take itself seriously all at the same time like in a really posh kind of way br br while the idea is somewhat factual like orcas are known for killing great white sharks its really hard to find it scary when i can't help but just see an angry shamoo destroying stuff especially that one scene where some building exploded cause of the orca's doing and while it explodes the thing jumps out of the water and it felt like i was watching a show at sea world with fireworks plus they kill a lot of the scary moments before they even hint that they're going to happen on top of that it takes a few jabs at jaws its like hey look we're being factual and we can come up with better reasons why the orca is attacking br br yes you are ignoring your outrageous ups in logic of course but jaws had one thing your movie doesn't its scary yes its implausible yes its somewhat outrageous but quite frankly factual or not a killer shark is not close to being as scary as a great white and the poor attempt at character development and writing just hurts it more even jaws the revenge is scarier than this,0
i turn on 700 club once in awhile and only agree with some of the statements made i'm one of many believers that is considered liberal by most christians and conservative by most non christians i vote my mind and its usually not rep or dem i don't believe 700 club tells people what to believe but that it represents many older christians that grew up in very conservative backgrounds i think many folks misunderstand what is said on 700 club it bums me out to hear name calling either direction i think 700 club folks really do love jesus but are so busy trying to get people to vote conservatively that they've forgotten to show love to certain people and promote peace like jesus did please don't judge jesus based on ignorant individuals that believe on him and let's also not be as ignorant with our comments about them why are people so mean to each other,0
i love old burt reynolds movies they're funnier and better than every other movie combined they might as well have stopped making movies after cannonball run 2 but i guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones man this movie's good burt reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot and the luxuriant loni anderson is on hand looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way burt and loni those were the days i used to have this magazine that had loni anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner i sure loved that advertisement plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something stroker ace burty r is doing and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment i laughed so hard i almost passed away into the night if you can find this movie rent it and then never watch another movie again because i tell you right now there's no point,1
redundant everlasting shots useless shots useless scenes are what you will find in this film in other words it seemed technically poor to me the musical bits are amateurishly directed no synchronization in the would be dancing badly post synchronized bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time etc br br the film is long and boring eventually it makes few point and even less sense br br there are some good ideas though some of the comic elements are actually efficient especially the opening scene however the film gets worse and worse so that it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand by the end br br the trailer i saw was very dynamic that is not true for the film that is to say the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual film is something very close to a rip off,0
this movie is just great if you have a chance to see it then you should run to see it even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932 pacino does a great job playing as tony montana to get around br br pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just great if you thought that pulp fiction was good with the swear words if you saw it then you should also see scarface to see another angle at how an actor can say them its quite sweet br br even though the movie is has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct it is still easy to follow along but you must keep your eyes peeled at all times to not lose anything personally i have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a breeze it is really just that great br br this movie is one of thoe movies that is acted and directed so well that not only do you forget that this movie was made in the crappy 80s but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy so say good night to the bad guy,1

there's a group of fox tv executives sitting around a boardroom table wondering what new show to commission br br 'how about aiming for something like 24 or the west wing ' says one of them but they all agree it would be too expensive and cheap tv is less likely to harm the station if it flops br br 'well how about getting together some great comedy writers and doing a quality sitcom ' offers another and is fired on the spot 'don't you know good writers cost lots of money ' the big chief barks 'that's why we invented reality tv ' br br 'we could do yet another crime drama ' suggests a man in a bland suit 'i'm listening ' the boss replies suddenly interested 'people like csi so let's do another copy of that ' blandman adds br br 'but there are already far too many csi clones out there what can we do to make ours stand out ' a naive junior enquires and is sacked instantly 'stand out if we do that people may be confused let's give them more of what they already like ' the big chief screams br br 'let's just add more violence and make it really grisly we are fox after all ' another suit suggests to a hearty reply of 'now you're getting it' from the big chief 'we could make them the deviant crimes unit ' he goes on to add clearly on a roll br br 'by jove he's got it ' the big chief laughs 'and the victims could be beautiful and vulnerable women who wear very little on screen ' 'well that would certainly distract people from the average acting and poor scripts ' blandman points out br br 'then it's settled we just need a name ' the big chief announces 'we could call it sex cops violence ' br br 'too literal how about killer instinctit conveys violence but sounds a bit like basic instinct which had lots of sex ' br br 'puuurfect' the big chief replies and then they all slap each other on the back and go and cancel arrested development,0
i too like dafoe as an actor but i wasted a few hours of my life actually watching this film i still cant believe i managed to watch it in its entirety was there actually a point to the film and the ending well im glad i never paid to see this awful pointless piece of pathetic excuse of a film br br im not sure without hunting the facts out but is dafoe married or seeing the awful actress in this film in real life if so was it an attempt to kick start her career if so im afraid it must have failed br br i post this in the hope i can actually put someone off watching this film even if 1 person takes heed of my comments and decides they would much rather watch paint drying i will feel i have made some good in the world if only i had had the same advice,0
a number of factors make it easy for me to state that i still think this is the most important science fiction film ever made despite some of the acting outdated dialogue etc br br first there is the scale of imagination in describing the krell a humanoid race native to the planet now all dead who were 1 million years more advanced than earth humans us and their technology particularly the 8 000 cubic mile machine br br second there is the music and sound effects which are inseparable from each other it creates an eerie unearthly feeling unlike 2001 which had traditional classical music br br third its monster is not only the most powerful and deadly ever envisioned it's also based on real science and doesn't break the laws of physics and biology br br finally and most importantly forbidden planet is the only movie ever made that attempts and more incredibly succeeds in making an honest intelligent and mercilessly logical statement on the limits or ceiling of human or any other biological entity's development no matter how long we survive as a species br br in other words it predicts our inevitable destiny,1
the video quality is awful the sound quality is pathetic the acting is horrific the dialog is painful the lighting is dismal the editing is laughable i could go on but it would be pointless snitch'd is a third rate amateur video being passed off as a feature film this one is best left to collect dust in the video store bargain bin,0
i just got back from this free screening and this osama witch project is the hands down worst film i've seen this year worse than even catwoman which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction br br in september tapes a film crew of documentary journalists heads to afghanistan despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip the conditions and oh yeah the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife's death on sept 11 to track down osama bin laden br br they made eight tapes on their journey which now document their travels and of course their attempts to kill the terrorist leader the eight tapes thankfully all end at points significant in the narrative which is convenient for a documentary br br the psychotic idiotic protagonist who is given to long significant speeches that he probably learned watching macgyver cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps i don't know why he didn't just wear a sign on his back that said shoot me br br the crew's translator supposedly their sensible voice of reason does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom br br you wish they'd brought along someone on their trip to call them all morons br br around tape 4 i began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew,0
after 30 seconds you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap knock off the story is taken from great movies like texas chainsaw massacre and hills have eyes i like those kind of movies even if they're duplicated well wrong turn timber falls carver br br but side sho is hard to watch the actors are really bad the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and totally misplaced you do not care at all what happens to the characters the so called bad guys are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypical so how about the blood and gore well there is some although it is rather cheap and the action is executed very poorly 2 points just for the gore and blood but do understand that this is hardly worth a look even for the gore hounds,0
i enjoyed longstreet which followed in the steps of raymond burr's successful ironside tv series and was intended to give it competition but this show was canceled after one season because it was decided i believe wrongly that longstreet was not able to compete with mr burr's ironside br br i may add that the pilot for this show was especially well done and very memorable i hope that a box set of longstreet will appear br br writers should note that this story idea was only briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show the play and interplay of disabilities on tv,1
it was fabulous the photography editing cinematography music combined to transport us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination it was the enjoyment of slumming without going through the danger we were there the dream sequences and flashback sequence ending were fresh it spoke to me keep up the good work another of that genre is city of god also don't laugh the comedy desperately seeking susan nice ensemble types with great performances by all sorry i think training day fits that genre as well with fantastic performances by an ensemble cast i had to switch the channel on some of the gritty sequences but all in all a great film,1
this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise i live in minnesota and even i can't believe they dumped cleveland yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league but still be consistent anyway i loved the first major league liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the indians would finally go all the way to the series you can't tell me this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed what happened anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don't watch this junk,0
a dreary hopelessly predictable film set in a most unpleasant setting lower coachella valley acting is as amateurish as any i've seen looks like a screenwriting 101 script however it does function as a great sedative,0
joseph h lewis was one of the finest directors of film noir this is surely his best br br it doesn't have some of the standard features of what we now call film noir though american made it is set entirely in england it lacks gangsters it lacks a femme fatale it does not lack crime br br the title character answers an ad she is overjoyed that she'll be making some money as a secretary instead she wakes up days later as the pawn in a frightening plot only a very strong person could survive such a terrifyingly unsettling ordeal and nina foch gives the sense of a strong woman as julia br br part of the excitement comes from casting against type ms foch has an elegant manner she is no screaming cowering victim she is actually a bit icy and patrician albeit impecunious this makes her character's plight all the more believable br br surely the single most fascinating element is the casting of dame may witty she was and is probably most famous for the charming title character in the lady vanishes she has a sweet manner and a harmless slightly dithering manner but here she is far from a heroine br br george macready is excellent as her extremely troubled son the whole cast in fact is superb br br it seems that this famous and brilliant movie was made almost by accident undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing but he did it on a low budget that is the thrill and charm of film noir the real film noir it is small convincingly lowlife and in this case unforgettable,1
spoilers br br i was very curious to see this film after having heard that it was clever and witty i had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom i felt br br the idea behind the film would have been acceptable depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience what made me dislike the whole film were two things br br first of all the film was so down to earth that it looked as if by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day to day basis it became itself ordinary and dull br br secondly the overall sloppiness of the production with dialogues that were barely understandable br br too bad,0
the '80's were not very kind to one time major star charles bronson starting with 1982's death wish ii and ending with this truly gruesome film from '89 bronson's screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness d w ii left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of bronson's character's daughter a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail 10 to midnight was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards nothing redeeming about it other films like the evil that men do and the remaining death wish films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge i'm not sure if the producers usually pancho kohner got a kick out of showing a weary looking senior citizen aged bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what but the shoddy craftsmanship and terrible scripts of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated br br kinjite the last of these films is fairly well made but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness in this film bronson sodomizes a perverse john forces a pimp to eat his rolex watch allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things i've thankfully forgotten also depicted is the gang rape of a young japanese girl fortunately this was off screen though well implied br br what were people thinking when they made this film what was bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films for anyone interested in his best movies check out most of the films he made in the '60's and '70's like the mechanic death wish from noon til 3 once upon a time in the west red sun the great escape the magnificent seven rider on the rain etc etc,0
not that he'd care but i'm not one of simon pegg's friends if i was there's a good chance we'd fallout if he continued to make dross like this the trouble is he found a successful formula as the bumbling ordinary guy next door type in shawn of the dead run fat boy run etc but it's starting to wear thin here his character has no discernible qualities he's rude and obnoxious and thinks he's funny when he frankly isn't when transferred to new york from london and i presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the atlantic he proves equally out of place with his new colleagues still is it any wonder when amongst his jolly japes he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting an act of revenge for his boss yet somehow kirsten dunst starts to warm to him even though he's done nothing nice oh and because he's a superficial male he falls for megan fox at first sight possibly because her character is as shallow as his it all makes for a predictable film conclusion although i can't see any viewer expressing how this mirrored their life the shame is that on paper this is a cast supposedly worth watching pegg though plays himself kirsten dunst seems to just go though the motions creating no on screen chemistry and megan fox isn't stretched at all the one huge plus is miriam margolyes as pegg's new york landlady now if she had been on screen longer,0
saw this movie when it came out in 1959 left a lasting impression great group of actors a little short timewise but a great movie all the same have only seen once since then and that was some time ago hopefully they'll put it out on dvd if they haven't already,1
that's not the sound of bees that's the effect induced by watching this extremely long extremely boring badly acted movie how i ever made it through all 3 1 2 hours without falling asleep i'll never know the plot is simple 3 thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for 3 1 2 hours and you thought rohmer was deadly this is even worse if that's possible i must really be a masochist if i could watch this entire movie without turning it off or killing someone,0
i read the running man from kings books as bachman and i felt for the main character john and his family this movie could have been so much more the trouble it was set during the big action movie craze i watched the movie and was in pain during the whole thing i felt nothing for the character and less for his cause yes it had funny scenes or laughable though i think that it did not save the movie in my eyes if you read the book you can feel the climax and the fire in the heart of john as he gets his final revenge br br i give this movie a low number it may not have been this low if i had not read the book,0
when american author edgar allan poe visits london he is approached by british journalist alan foster who becomes the target of a peculiar wager not believing poe's assertion that all of his macabre stories have been based on actual experience foster accepts a bet from poe and his friend sir thomas blackwood that he cannot spend an entire night in the blackwood's haunted castle once installed in the abandoned castle foster discovers that he is not alone as he is approached by various beautiful women and handsome men and a doctor of metaphysics who explains that they are all lost souls damned to replay the stories of their demises on the anniversary of their deaths the first time i watched this glorious bit of classic horror i was mesmerized the entire time i found the movie genuinely creepy and at the same time sorrowful babs steele is undeniably beautiful the music score makes the atmosphere twice as terror inducing the topless scene threw me for a loop as i was not expecting it it looks as synapse did a great job with picture enhancement because this movie looks damn fine for its age and it's the uncut international version to boot this is the movie responsible for me starting a babs steele and klaus kinski collection,1
this is a pretty bad movie but not so bad as it's reputation suggests the production values aren't too bad and there is the odd effective scene and it does have an 80's cheezoid veneer that means that it is always kind of fun watch out too for jimmy nail's brief appearance his attempt at an american accent is so astoundingly rubbish it's fantastic fantastic too are sybil danning's breasts they make a brief appearance in the movie but the scene is repeated umpteen times in the end credits in what can only be described as the 12 remix of sybil danning's boobs has to be seen to be believed as a horror movie it isn't scary the effects are silly and christopher lee turns up to sleepwalk through his performance i guess he was buying a new house and needed some cash for the deposit the two central characters the man and the woman were so negligible that i have forgotten almost everything about them and i just watched this movie earlier tonight the werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original movie in fact bizarrely they sometimes look more like badly burned apes the eastern european setting is quite good and the music provided by the new wave band babel while being pretty terrible does at least give the film some added cheese br br overall good for a laugh not good quality but did you seriously expect it to be and at the very least you've always got sybil's knockers,0
i grew up watching and loving this cartoon every year i didn't think they would be able to take a half hour 20 min cartoon and make it a movie they did it with flying colours fabulous funny heart warming effective movie,1
fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately blood surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid redundant pulp horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal 'crocodile' directed by a disappointing tobe hooper and 'lake placid' blood surf is every bit as bad as these other films and  on top of that  it likes to exaggerate tremendously the saltwater crocodile supposedly is 90 years old over 30 ft long and it kills for fun during the film he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer dudes dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark congested area the only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location even though it's a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this the lagoons and nature looks marvelous every other aspect is simply disastrous there's a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable the dialogues are downright painful to listen to you won't believe some of the lines these actors have to say i know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but i hope for their own sake they're not that stupid early in the film one of the characters refers to jaws as being a 'mechanical toy' but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than spielberg's great white shark the visual effects in 'blood surf' are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress i won't say too much about the acting since it's secondary in flicks like this the girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast you guessed right blood surf is a very bad film so bad it becomes fun again but 'funny' for a whole other reason than james hickox intended,0
an excellent family movie gives a lot to think on there's absolutely nothing wrong in this film everything is just perfect the script is great it's so real such things could happen in everyone's life and don't forget about acting it's just awesome just look at frankie and you'll know what i thought about this picture is a real can't miss,1
bingo is the game bullshit is the name rarely has the screen been smeared with such a blown up hodgepodge of half baked conspiracy theories puritan prudery and new age gibberish the bulk of the story is set at viciente a cristian resort in the peruvian jungle think tolkien's rivendell meets star trek's planet baku inhabited by dimwitted followers of a not so mysterious but surprisingly narrow minded cult of love and peace thanks to gruesome acting and tacky production design the rainbow colored visualization of the mysterious all healing energy is particularly hideous the celestine prophecies looks and feels like a discarded 1980s twilight zone episode factual errors regarding church history and nomenclature abound i can't believe hector elizondo agreed to be a part of this maybe it was made without his consent bowfinger style may the lord have mercy on the director the screenwriter the author of the novel and the poor souls who see the movie or read the book,0
this is just usual indian garbage that gets turned out as cinema as indians we can proudly boast that we have the biggest cinema industry however it also the worst br br how can other poor countries have films with real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies and we just keep on pumping out garbage take a look at russia iran china and latin america look at the brilliant films they have and we get crap like kisna br br get real people no wonder the international community in general laughs at indian cinema,0
this show is freaking hilarious the jokes are original god and i love eric and kelso yeah i know what they say after the 8th season it's not funny anymore because eric and kelso are no longer in the show and randy is a real dumbass randy is comparing to eric and kelso br br you cant take the funniest characters and switch em with i'm a cool guy kind of guy randy it isn't his fault anyway but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny it's still is not as much as the earlier seasons but its alright br br the 360's are awesome the circle red is a real kind of mental abusing dad and kitty is always half high half pie hyde tries to be cool all the time he has his moments too the least favrioutes characters are jackie and donna they're cool but not without kelso and eric br br great show dumbass,1
are you kidding that was awful br br but that notwithstanding i got given this film and 3 others and they were all on dvd the film starts of pretty much an ok movie but goes downhill from about the middle onwards br br and the ending well let's just say it was one of the most anti climatic endings in recent film history lots of gore in the end sequence and if you like a dose of schlock horror then this is the film for you br br 3 10,0
once again jet li brings his charismatic presence to the movie screen in the film black mask in this film li plays tsui an escapee from a super soldier program who seeks to regain the humanity that the program had taken away from him to do this tsui decides to become a librarian in order to live a normal and peaceful life but fate demands that he clean up problems from his past before he can continue to seek peace other members of the super soldier program had escaped at the same time as tsui but they want to get even with the world rather than find inner peace thus tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former team mates from releasing information that could cost many innocent people their lives this film screams across the screen at a frantic pace and never lets its audience go the martial arts is amazing but because it uses wires it may not be appreciated as much as it deserves by american audiences if you like action movies that have an interesting story and demand good acting performances because they deal with psychological as well as physical conflicts then black mask is for you i am glad to see that some of jet li's movies are finally getting main stream release in the united states and look forward to seeing how the changes that that release will require things like dubbing and soundtrack will affect the film this is one of li's best films go out and see it on may 14 when it is released in america,1
paulie sounds like the most saccharine lachrymose and sentimental garbage you could ever find yet it's actually much better than you might expect the daftness of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film but actually in most other departments the film is charming br br in case you're wondering paulie is a parrot bought for a little girl with speech difficulties paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her he even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons and eventually becomes a super intelligent speaker himself however paulie is sent away by the little girl's mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from n y c to l a to be re united with her br br so why does this awful sounding film succeed relatively well firstly it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects secondly and far more significantly it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving often humourous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline thirdly it has several surprisingly strong performances including jay mohr as a wily crook gena rowlands as a kind old lady and cheech marin yes the dope smoking cheech marin as a musical immigrant it might not be a classic but paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages,1
there have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that i really liked this was not one of them br br it was overacted and used camera techniques that made me feel like i was watching a soap opera it was ludicrously predictable and took most of the movie to get going then left you asking that's it once i decided not to take the movie too seriously and watch it from a purely corny point of view it became more enjoyable this is one movie that would have wound up on mst3000 if it was still on,0
i was to young to ever know much about prince but in the past few years i've seen a lot of purple rain novelty tee's and i thought they were cool but i didn't want to buy a shirt i knew nothing about so one saturday it came on fuse and i decided to watch it i didn't know what the movie was going to be about before i watched it but it was great once i found out in the movie prince wasn't known as prince but as the kid all the performances where great to me but my favorite were purple rain darling nicki and i would die for you all the songs tied into what was going on through out the movie when his mother and father were always fighting the song when doves cried described what he was feeling i also like how clever prince was with the way he flirted with apallonia i liked when prince and appallonia first met in the club and he stood behind her standing and then once she turned around he disappeared great movie and now i cant even find one of those tee shirts,1
there are way too many subjects avoided in cinema and eating disorders is one of them this film shows it as it is it is not glamourised for the viewers to enjoy it is shown with real truth which makes it all the more powerful i've only seen it once and that was a few years ago but i can still remember everything about it and how it made me feel it is a very powerful film and is good support for anyone suffering from a eating disorder to give them the willpower to stop this is what films should be about they should be there to help people and not glamourise things that are wrong,1
land of plenty is not a film it is a tombstone for the directorial career of german director wim wenders br br many felt it in the million dollar hotel and now land of plenty makes it perfectly clear not only has wenders lost it he's actually turned into a bad director creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes br br one might argue that the time you lose it comes for every director but wenders' case is extreme it's as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again only to get sloppish results br br in a few words this film does not deserve your time,0
it's telling that as of the entry of this comment no females have submitted a vote of any kind for this movie not surprisingly cheesy science fiction doesn't appeal to them quite as much if you like a good b movie and especially if you like to satirize them as you watch you will like this if you don't have fun watching bad movies this one's not for you,0
this complicated western was a milestone in the career of james stewart after his return from war service wanting to change his image by doing a western which is largely regarded as the reason for the influx of westerns in the '50s since it's very impressive too bad it wasn't photographed in technicolor br br stewart wins first prize for the gun that won the west but then has to spend the rest of the film trying to recover it when it's stolen shelley winters is a shady gal with an unsavory reputation and stephen mcnally is the local bad boy gunman in dodge city will geer is wyatt earp and dan duryea is shelley's bad boyfriend and wouldn't you know that it being a universal international film tony curtis and rock hudson both quite unknown at the time have bit roles br br an interesting sequence features the first indian attack whereby charles drake reveals himself to be a coward who rides off leaving shelley alone in the horse drawn wagon he later redeems himself but it's just one of the twists and turns that has the gun passing from one unsavory hand to another but finally ending up with the rightful owner br br stephen mcnally and james stewart have quite a final shootout that is almost as melodramatic but not quite as duel in the sun's blazing guns finale mcnally makes the perfect villain and dan duryea is equally treacherous in the kind of villainous role he played throughout the '40s as a low life gunslinger br br tightly constructed story is extremely well directed by anthony mann and it's fun to see rock hudson credited as young bull wearing indian war paint and tony curtis as a young soldier who casts longing glances at the then slim and attractive shelley winters br br well worth viewing and definitely an above average story,1
the movie is a fantasy the story line is thin but serves as the structure upon which some wonderful songs are sung and sung beautifully i still cannot believe that such handsome and attractive people could sing this well some of the dialog is wonderfully clever the costumes made me feel as though i was watching a haute couture fashion show from 1942 br br movies are designed to serve various purposes this one is designed to entertain and it certainly does if i have one negative comment it would be that nelson eddy was a little too old to be the handsome dashing count some of the closeups made me uncomfortable but he could still sing and sing magnificently however jeanette macdonald was just as dazzling as ever she makes a spectacular angel br br this genre is well before my time and i an new to the jeanette macdonald nelson eddy films and related conversation the music in this movie is beautiful as much as i love the classic rock music which fills most modern movies there is no question in my mind that this music is simply and clearly more memorable more delightful better constructed the stars in this movie are more talented than the stars i see in the movie theaters today and jeanette macdonald without the benefit of beverly hills plastic surgeons was more beautiful than the stars i see today i am unclear as to why so many other posters are apologetic about liking this movie and more generally this group of movies they say it is dated and try to explain why it is the way it is and those that do not like it say that it is not very good but compared to what i think this movie will doubtless still be entertaining people when so many other movie are long forgotten there is just too much quality in every way in this movie for it not to be remembered and enjoyed i recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who appreciates great talent great beauty and great music,1
by 1941 columbia was a full fledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as mgm paramount or warners that's the best thing that could be said about adam had four sons a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by ingrid bergman top billed for the first time in an american film and warner baxter bergman plays a frenchwoman this was the era in which hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another hired as governess to baxter's four sons and staying on with one interruption caused by the stock market crash of 1907 until the boys are grown men serving in world war i just about everyone in the movie is so goody good it's a relief when susan hayward as the villainess enters midway through  she's about the only watchable person in the movie even though she's clearly channeling bette davis and vivien leigh it's also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles  but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous no wonder bergman turned down the similarly plotted the valley of decision four years later,0
it's hard for me to criticize anything that mitzi kapture does she just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress that notwithstanding yes the plot was predictable i think perhaps if jill had slept with richard then it may have made him a little crazier than he already was which would have added more to the suspense it would have also been nice to see jill and her husband find out about richard's little problem with his ex wife maybe a bit more back story i was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie i would have liked to have seen more closure with zack's death and possibly closure with her husband i do have to say though i will never be able to look at a flare gun and not picture her standing there it was a very fitting end for richard of course mitzi rocked i am so looking forward to her future projects,1
waterdance explores a wide variety of aspects of the life of the spinally injured artfully from the petty torments of faulty fluorescent lights flashing overhead to sexuality masculinity and depression the experience of disability is laid open br br the diversity of the central characters themselves underscores the complexity of the material examined joel the writer raymond the black man with a murky past and bloss the racist biker at first these men are united by nothing other than the nature of their injuries but retain their competitive spirit over time shared experience both good and bad brings them together as friends to support one another br br most obvious of the transformations is that experienced by joel who initially distances himself from his fellow patients with sunglasses headphones and curtains as he comes to accept the changes that disablement has made to his life joel discards these props and begins to involve himself in the struggles of the men with whom he shares the ward br br the dance referred to in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep one's head above water to give up the dance is to reject life waterdance is a moving and powerful film on many levels and i do not hesitate to recommend it,1
this is one of the few movies released about a what if type of situation that made me think it was amazing to hear them speak to each other and reminisce about all the wonderful and not so wonderful things that happened between them i actually think that there is a very good possibility this occurred like the movie implies and they actually made peace with each other those are good memories for every fan to hang onto and to ask what actually happened between them would be selfish what an amazing movie this was the comedic aspects of the movie were wonderful to think that they were together to patch things up between them in such a way is a comforting thought to people who wish they had a chance to clear the air with someone they didn't get to to see john as such a caring laid back character was refreshing from hearing all of the trash that was spoken about him,1
warning i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment br br although i haven't seen them all the hamiltons sure did deliver one lowsy piece of entertainment which it did not entertain me at all i thought that in common with the semi bad acting stupid plot scheme and the twist at the end of the movie which was very retarded this movie sucked okay so supposively these are people who eat other people yeah notice i said people not humans not because they aren't human or wait i think they are oh no wait they didn't tell you so okay are these people cannibals or are they imbreds or what are they i mean maybe they're just things that came here to see what people taste like or are they cannibals who have eaten people for a long time now or maybe this movie was hhoorriibbllee which it was so if you think the hamiltons is good i ask of you why why why why why was it so awesome because to me it was just flat out terrible one big booooooo for the hamiltons go see the gravedancers tooth nail or borderland for a piece of entertainment,0
in its way mister foe originally and more appropriately titled hallam foe  i can't see addressing its title character as mister is a tribute to good acting both jamie bell as hallam a physically attractive voyeur creep and sophia myles as kate his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance are convincing the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life a young man who spies on the intimate details of people's lives the way hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp and a woman in kate's situation would be repulsed and frightened she would probably call the police br br these things are not however what happens in the movie poor hallam's mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he's been having an affair hallam of course hates his stepmother and lets he know it she has sex with him kate's some kind of an employment person who places hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games she looks like his birth mother it all ends happily with hallam resolving his issues br br forty some years ago the play and brilliantly acted movie who's afraid of virginia woolf had a similarly optimistic ending with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart the trouble is it doesn't always work that way especially when nobody really cares in virginia woolf the ending's plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation in mister foe the emotional revelation never really happens,0
'the omen 4 the awakening' is a made for television sequel to the original 'the omen' film instead of satan possessing the body of a little boy he possesses the body of a little girl adopted by rich parents who is bullied at school and who ends up getting revenge against those who do her wrong the film seems to struggle with any horror factor and a lot of the events that happen are simply silly rather than particularly frightening and it is difficult to believe that this little girl is satan even with all of the events that surround it i just did not find this film very suspenseful or frightening particularly when compared to the original,0
this was barbra streisand's first television special and is must see viewing for any streisand fan even non streisand fans will enjoy this highly energetic and entertaining piece of entertainment history performers like this only come our way once in a lifetime brilliant,1
i had the misfortune to sit through the full 102 minutes of what in my opinion is this shockingly bad film it fails on pretty much all levels the cast is awful the acting ham at best and the plot lacks any depth leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story lines br br plan b has none of the charm this genre has the scope to convey and i found myself physically cringing at the various points where the script makes its regular misjudged meanderings anywhere towards the region of comedy br br a bona fide saccharine coated turd of a movie,0
this was a pretty good movie i liked it i thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and how it's not about dieting it's about having a pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal with it and they choose this beth was a very accurately drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mom about the eating disorder you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is that she is feeling i also think one of the best lines in the movie is where beth yells the words it's not about you to her mother those words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie i think that that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie,1
i cannot believe how uneducated this movie is it's like watching police academy except it's with people that have no clue of what they are talking about and wait there is a stupid robot that is supposed to be a sidekick i can understand suspension of disbelief but this is just complete stupidity not only is there no plot to this movie it's like watching someone that pretends to be a doctor throw non medical words around as if they were chief of staff at a major medical facility plus the people are wearing clothes that are un befitting for a space program i feel like i'm watching a valley girls b movie in space,0
this is definitely an appropriate update for the original except that party on the left is now party on the right like the original this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty it is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over zealous and over powerful federal government kowalski serves as a metaphor for waco and ruby ridge where the us government with the cooperation of the mainstream media threw around words like white supremacist and right wing extremists as well as trumped up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its' citizens rights with the willing acquiescence of the general populace that message is so non pc i am stunned that this film could be made at least not without bringing the federal government via the irs down on the makers like they did to juanita broderick katherine prudhomme the western journalism center and countless others who dared to speak out live free or die is the motto on jason priestly's hat as he brilliantly portrays the voice and that sums up the dangerous to some message of this film br br,1
the major fault in this film is that it is impossible to believe any of these people would ever be cast in a professional production of macbeth hearing david lansbury's soft voice struggling laboriously with the famous tomorrow tomorrow and tomorrow speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him for the role i kept believing therefore that he didn't get the part because he was a lousy actor not because a bigger name was available then when we see portions of the play in rehearsal it is difficult to believe the director is not parodying things with a hopelessly miscast misdirected travesty of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and directors who see the play through their own screwball interpretations sometimes directors are so anxious to have their films done and writers think they have the ability to direct their own works that they settle for less this appears to be such an example,0
this movie is so bad it's funny it stars scott backula as some coach but that's not important what is important is the large black fellow who plays 1st base first off he has to be at least 75 years old yet still plays minor league baseball second he starts out the movie in the outfield despite not being able to walk let alone run coach backula brilliantly moves him to first citing the fact that when he attempts to run he stays in the same place for too long a period of time backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy in the end of the film spoiler he tells his star player downtown to hit a home run clearly downtown viewed this as a good move he hit the home run and won the game for his team a minor league squad playing the twins who were the class of the majors in the movie now if only tony muser manager of the royals would be as smart a coach as backula and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat the royals would never end an inning let alone lose a game,0
if you have ever seen a movie by brian avenet bradley and compares it to the feedbacks it gets on imdb you know that most of the comments and votes are faked trust me you will be bored people of the production team write their feedback themselves sometimes they even admit it but that's not enough they also click constantly no whenever there is a negative comment on the movie that's why negative critics are always placed behind the hyped ones br br the movie itself is bad bad bad bad acting bad lighting bad script bad ending believe me now if not you will believe me later br br brian avenet bradley might be quite a good business man otherwise it cannot be explained that he finds people who still finance his movies okay they are cheap but nevertheless but as a creative person he is a complete failure,0
having heard of modesty blaise before but never having read a novel or a comic strip my wife and i liked the film a lot it delivered in a captivating way a good introduction to the character and her background br br although it has some action flick elements it is much more an intimate play excellently written sadly this is also where a major drawback of the movie is revealed an intimate play lives on the capabilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast delivered while alexandra staden did an excellent job as modesty blaise her counterpart nikolaj coaster waldau as the villain miklos did not smiling his way through the plot as if it is an extend toothpaste commercial he fails to build up an atmosphere of anxiety that would have made the movie a masterpiece the supporting cast is somehow similar from some stereotyped gangsters and sluts to decent performances from fred pearson as professor lob and eugenia yuan as irina,1
this movie for what it is may be one of the most amazing indie films of recent day made on a super small budget the film has special effects that blow away alot of the current films if you have a chance watch it,1
oh dear god this was horrible there is bad then there was this this movie makes no sense at all it runs all over the map and isn't clear about what its saying at all the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman the fact that 'edison' isn't a real city takes away since i live in vancouver watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable why didn't they make it a real city the only writing that was decent was'tilman' in which john heard did a fantastic job he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy it was actually a shame to see john heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time and the movie be a washout too bad hopefully someone important will see it and at least give john heard credit where credit is due and hire him as lead bad guy again which is where he should be on the a list,0
like most of the festivals entries hamiltons makes for an interesting watch a film thats all ideas and little execution although impressive for it's obvious low budget the film falters in it's final twist and becomes dreadfully long during it's drawn out and obvious conclusion the film is about a family of murderous outcasts trying to survive after there parents have died they kidnap people drain the blood from them and feed something locked away in their basement there's some nice darkly humorous performances from mckellhar and firgens and the rest are just so so the film never feels realistic or very disturbing for that matter but for the first half taps into an oddly humorous and dark mixture which is a surprising accomplishment the next half isn't so successful as it receeds into film oblivion with unrealistic twists into a ridiculously cocky finale that turns the entire film into utter crap it's a shame though there is no doubt that some talent was involved with this production and although deeply flawed it remains original and creative too bad that when it comes to the delivery it completely fails on every level br br 5,0
watching the first 30 minutes of sands of oblivion gave me high hopes it seemed i was in for a cheaper version of the mummy the setup was promising in the 1920's cecil b demille makes his opus of the ten commandments it seems in using real egyptian artifacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil don't they always aware of what had been unleashed demille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site the movie's first mistake but hey those period costumes are expensive and this is a sci fi channel movie the first sightings we get of the anubis monster are well done and it's a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy cg effect then the body counts starts this is were the movie went south for me the reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do they make the usual stop to the guy who knows the truth but never told anyone after getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site no they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk really i'm not the most motivated person but if i knew a demon from ancient egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me i'd put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem after this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the anubis monster in the usual way by racing around in dune buggies and shooting it with a rocket launcher while it's standing by a pile of phosphorous grenades for a sci fi movie it was above the usual crap they put out which isn't saying much at all what disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had wrote a decent script for it,0
this film looked promising but it was actually pretty bad the premise was o k but the plot itself was terrible the actors tried their best with limited material but they could not rise above the mean spiritedness of this tacky college film jason schwartzman was once again immensely irritating even more so than in rushmore the rest of the cast were quite non eventful scenes that should have been fun turned out to be off putting incredibly juvenile tries to be a road trip american pie but fails dismally on all levels a total waste of everyone's time,0
i had never seen a silent movie until july 24 2005 i had never seen a movie with mary pickford in it i've seen thousands of movies very few are hypnotic to me i found last of the mohicans and unforgettable ray liotta to be hypnotic so consider the source as you read this i started watching tess of the storm country on tcm just to see who this mary pickford was who has been credited by many for launching hollywood i had no idea what i was in for two hours later i snapped out of it and realized i'd watched one of the most beautiful women i had ever seen playing a role perfectly suited to her imagine a movie fan in 1922 having never seen anyone that gorgeous and that expressive before you would have to see her again and again the setting was perfect for a girl that expressive she was a poor squatter couldn't speak the king's english but you had to admire her what a movie time to start my mary pickford movie collection,1
a powerfully wonderful movie you are held in a death grip once you let yourself get involved with the story a successful dentist alan johnson don cheadle is torn in a life crisis of balancing his career with his family he notices his former college roommate charlie fineman adam sandler and wants to touch base he finds that charlie who lost his wife and family in the 9 11 attack on america is no longer in touch with reality choosing to involve his mind with his favorite music from the past and video games the former roommates rekindle their friendship and strengthen their former bond johnson has his friend angela oakhurts liv tyler a psychiatrist to try and bring charlie out of his grief but it is alan that accomplishes in getting his friend to emerge from his deep darkness jada pinkett smith plays johnson's wife writer and director mike binder plays the role of charlie's attorney guardian also in the cast saffron burrows donald sutherland adell modell and robert klein outstanding soundtrack featuring the likes of bruce springsteen graham nash pear jam and the pretenders br br note i have never been a sandler fan but i found him outstanding in this role in some of the scenes i thought out loud why has he never been approached to play singer songwriter bob dylan in a biopic,1
the class is a comedy series that portrays a bunch of 27 year old former class mates br br i like the idea of the show that's why it saddens me that the class is not funny even though it has the obvious potential it's not enough corky just dorky haha this is due to a slowish tempo and the lack of actually hilarious punch lines also some actors have difficulties with timing br br most inventively written characters are the twins kat and lina warbler lizzy caplan and heather goldenhersh but even they seem just a little too square for the good of the show on the other hand the characters i find most uninteresting are the main character ethan and the used to be couple duncan and nicole br br what bothers me with the series is that the only latino character aaron is being picked on for his accent even though by a non respectable character but anyway,0
corky romano has to be one of the most jaw dropping and horrific comedy's ever made br br while the sometimes amusing chris kattan who pulled off a very funny performance in the hilarious 'undercover brother' his character in corky is so stupid and so unfunny which is a shame since the premise is a wonderful idea to bad they ran out of them when they got to page 3 on the script,0
this was a very good film i didn't go into it with very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the acting the script and the scenery miranda richardson was fantastic and so was joan plowright they stole the show but the other actors played their parts wonderfully also very enjoyable film,1
girlfight follows a project dwelling new york high school girl from a sense of futility into the world of amateur boxing where she finds self esteem purpose and much more although the film is not about boxing boxing is all about the film so much so you can almost smell the sweat technically and artistically a good shoot with an sense of honesty and reality about it girlfight is no chick flick and no rocky it is rather a very human drama which even viewers who don't know boxing will be able to connect with,1
before watching this movie i thought this movie will be great as flashpoint because before watching this movie flashpoint was the last jenna jameson and brad armstrong movie i previously watched as far as sexual scenes are concerned i was disappointed i thought sexual scenes of dreamquest will be great as flashpoint sexual scenes but i was disappointed except asia carrera's sexual scene any sexual scene in this movie doesn't make me feel great you know what i mean the great jenna jameson doesn't do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of felecia and stephanie swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concerned br br although its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor this movie is very good if typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies story acting direction sets makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great the actors of this movie done really good acting they all done a great job dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies,1
yes this movie is a real thief it stole some shiny oscars from avatar just because politicians wanted another war hero movie to boost the acceptance support for the wars u s is still fighting today i do not really want to go here into politics but come on this is more clear than the summer sky hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding no real plot at all i really feel myself in the 50's of hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like the same propaganda movies were produced that time only with the exception that those were black and white even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the u s wars are cool genre you surely have much better movies to choose from,0
a very slick modern keeping it sensually hip revamp on the dracula story although staying with the traditional customs with quite an interesting if not fully grasped back story of the prince of darkness the first time i tried watching it i could only make it halfway through before losing interest again it gets off to a good start especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with dracula but then for me it got less involving when it hits new orleans to focus on van helsing's daughter a great place to set it but never took advantage of its settings despite etching a paradise in damn where dracula could flourish produced by wes carven and yeah they throw that name out there but written directed by patrick lussier artistically it had its moments with few dreamlike visuals but some kinetic editing and cheap jolts don't help the messy script does get considerably silly lussier does a polished job that remains rather glassy inserting a lot of blood the make up is suitably achieved and a lot of virgin advertising no i don't mean virgins it's the music company as it does get in numerous shots and helsing's daughter works there too oh that wasn't obvious planting the soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes now the performances are all over the shop but there are few familiar faces to spot danny masterson sean patrick thomas nathan fillion shane west and lochlyn munro gerard butler as dracula just didn't come off as not much of a presence was formed he was simply out shined by the succulent ladies of the night jennifer esposito colleen fitzpatrick and jeri ryan as dracula's brides the likes of jonny lee millar and justine waddell are respectably okay christopher plummer gives out a grizzled turn as van helsing and omar epps has fun with his role,0
i was really impressed with this film the writing was fantastic and the characters were all rich and simple it's very easy to get emotionally attached to all of them the creators of this movie really hit the nail right on the head when it comes to creating real life characters and getting the viewer sucked right into their world further the music is terrific they employed some independents to do the score and some of the soundtrack and they do a fantastic job adding to the movie if you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or at a film festival like i did i highly recommend that you go see it also on a personal note paget brewster is beautiful in this movie that's reason enough to go check it out,1
i was really hoping that this would be a funny show given all the hype and the clever preview clips and talk about hype i even heard an interview with the show's creator on the bbc world today a show that is broadcast all over the world br br unfortunately this show doesn't even come close to delivering all of the jokes are obvious the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame and they are not given any new treatment or twist all of the characters are one dimensional the acting is well mediocre i'm being nice it's the classic cbc recipe one that always fails br br if you're muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters and if you're white you'd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted ignorant or both not that making fun of white people is a problem most of the better comedies are rooted in that it's only a problem when it isn't funny as in this show br br canada is bursting with funny people so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis so how come the producers of this show couldn't find any,0
this is almost certainly the worst western i've ever seen the story follows a formula that is especially common to westerns and martial arts films hero learns that family friends have been murdered so hero sets out to exact revenge foils the ineffective lawman rescues the kidnapped loving damsel and murders the expert arch nemesis in a brutal duel this formula has often been successful otherwise it wouldn't be a formula but gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see the scripting is atrociously simple minded and insulting it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth maturity and realism the sound is bad it sometimes looks dubbed the cinematography is lame and the sets are sometimes just facades the acting is pitiful sure some of the performers could blame the script but others cannot use that excuse i hope i never see chris lybbert in a speaking role ever again every time he says a line that should be angry or mean he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho and speaking of chris lybbert who plays hopalong check out his duds if you dare to watch this film he wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like roy rogers than a hard working down and dirty cowboy if you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of hopalong cassidy then get this but if you have more than two neurons watch something else,0
it takes guts to make a movie on gandhi in india in which he is not shown as a man who could do no wrong this movie shows how a mahatma failed to be a decent father at least in the eyes of his son br br the performances are terrific the cinematography fantastic the direction fabulous but the film drags if the intention was to make this movie without any box office expectations which i assume is the case here then its a brilliant attempt but if the makers were expecting this to be a commercial success then the film's fate was doomed the day they chose this subject br br 20 yrs from now this movie will be remembered for the brilliant portrayal of harilal by akshaye khanna he deserves an oscar nomination for this one and honestly his is not the only performance worth applauding shefali chhaya is terrific too br br watch the scene where harilal hears about his father's death no dialogues no screaming but a speechless shot by khanna its one of the finest scenes ever shot in the history of cinema br br gandhi my father is not at all exciting cinema but yes its excellent cinema and a must watch brilliant attempt,1
this is one of the worst movies ever made trite predictable flat br br the only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes highlighting barcelona i imagine they would use films like this in guantanamo or some other hidden cia nsa prison to torture suspects br br often bad movies have some redeeming features this has nothing if i was in it or worked on it i would change my name truly a turd hard to write more than this but i feel the world's film watchers needed a head's up on this on the other hand it will make a great gift for people you can't stand br br you could send it to politicians you dislike in laws ex wives teachers you hated former employees dick cheney w and a host of others,0
when i rented this movie i had very low expectations but when i saw it i realized that the movie was less a lot less than what i expected the actors were bad the doctor's wife was one of the worst the story was so stupid it could work for a disney movie except for the murders but this one is not a comedy it is a laughable masterpiece of stupidity the title is well chosen except for one thing they could add stupid movie after dead husbands i give it 0 and a half out of 5,0
this movie is directed by renny harlin the finnish miracle stallone is gabe walker cat and mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists renny harlin knows how to direct actionmovie stallone needed this role to get back on track snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow ice cold and bad weather than finnish man action is good music in the film is spectacular the bad guy is john litghow other stars micheal rooker the portrait of serialkiller janine turner strong medicine the is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie overall good movie br br remember extreme ääliöt special collectors edition with good extras comig soon in finland straight to video,1
atlantis was much better than i had anticipated in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age although this film did demand a soid attention span at times it was a great film for all ages i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis,1
this film is something like a sequel of white zombie since it is made by the same man halperin and features zombies halperin the george a romero of his day fails to deliver with this one though br br we have a man who can control the minds of people in cambodia and a search to destroy the source of his power so the zombies can be sent free also a love interest for the evil man br br where this film really excels is in the imagery the cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and the zombie look very powerful in their large numbers unfortunately we don't really get to see much of the zombies in action and the love story seems to play a much too large role for a horror film though this has a valid plot reason later on br br i would have loved to see some 1930s zombies attack helpless city folk but this film just did not deliver and no strong villain like bela lugosi was waiting to do battle against our heroes and the use of lugosi's eyes a nice effect but misleading as he is never in the film why not recreate this with the new actor's eyes overall a film that could be a great one with a little script re working and could someday be a powerful remake especially if they keep it in the same post war time frame heck if they can fix up the hills have eyes then this film has hope,0
yeah the archetype of a simple but inspirational movie the very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever i see it that's just brilliant joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life the way he interacts with danny glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and exhilarating a very nice family movie with i concede a rather corny happy end but hey it doesn't really matter the movie retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes,1
i had a personal interest in this movie when i was 17 and just out of high school i got a job at 20th century fox as a member of the laborers and hod carriers union at the end of my first day sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier i was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc for one or two weeks when i arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward san diego just short of there we stopped at an army base called either camp callan or camp hahn once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into camp pendleton the big marine base there on the beach we started building what was supposed to be a japanese pacific island base it took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation which included a water tank gun entrenchments sand bagged trenches and living quarters all this was at very high pay sometimes 'golden time' which was triple our regular hourly wage our food was also first rate prime rib at lunch etc which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home br br once the job was finished i waited eagerly for the movie to come out which was about eight or ten months later then i waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen then it was no more than three or four minutes maybe less of the movie's heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens a bit disappointing but still fun br br in spite of the disappointment i enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since i learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and fox was paid on a cost plus basis which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there bob weverka,1
freddy's dead the final nightmare the sixth installment of the nightmare on elm street series and once again another bad sequel i think this is tied up with the last sequel of the dream child i was lucky enough to get the nightmare on elm street series box dvd set for my birthday so i got to see all the sequels may i say that i'm just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels at least the past two it just seems like freddy lost his edge it's almost like the writers were trying to give freddy a soul and they're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story this was a sequel that wasn't needed sorry to robert englund but this was very much below what freddy krueger represents br br freddy is back but he's got something we don't know about a daughter maggie she's not aware that he is her father but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help she has to do her best to resist his powers but it's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father ironic isn't it but freddy isn't giving up without manipulating her into his ways br br freddy's dead the final nightmare is also presented in 3 d radical huh note the sarcasm this is one of the worst sequels it's tied up with the fifth sequel of the nightmare on elm street series i'd rather watch the second nightmare on elm street to be honest this just had bad acting stupid editing and just over all a bad idea for a story i didn't like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who freddy krueger really is the death master of nightmares not father knows best br br 2 10,0
horrible waste of time bad acting plot directing this is the most boring movie ever there are bad movies that are fun freddy vs jason and there are bad movies that are horrible this one fits into the latter bottom line don't waste your time,0
the movie lacks credence with the helicopters which didn't exist until the 1950s but no woman would do what was done here even a woman before the women's movement of the 60s and 70s about the only portion of the movie that you could believe in was that germany would want to know where the landing would be ignore for the moment that the british had captured all the spies but even if they had not they wouldn't have let one roam around like this just to reassure the germans that the landing would be at calais it isn't one major thing that makes the movie not work it is the culmination of all the things wrong that makes the movie fail bad directing bad scripts no attempt at authenticity at all all combine to just make the movie fall flat generally speaking spies should fade into the woodwork the suspense comes in with the spy wondering if the information they have is valid or not and worrying about being detected on this one that game was over from the start this spy was doing anything but spying your only chance at getting something that has some credibility and instills some suspense may be to read the book,0
this is a beautiful movie that is wonderfully acted by all players it will make you laugh and it will make you cry the very end of the movie gets me to mist up every time if you want to see a great movie this is it jimmy stewert supplies a wonderfully witty performance and frank morgan as mr matuschek is spellbinding morgan's diversity of character is nothing short of amazing william tracy as pepi is terrific comic relief and delivers some of the movies most important lines and performances felix bressart delivers a fantastic performance as perovitch a stumbling bumbling shop worker who's life's ambition is to please those he works with it is a simple story of how close co workers can become and how two people who have great animosity towards each other fall in love though unusual circumstances,1
stephen j cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and dabble in horror the result dead above ground is an abysmal piece of junk now had i noticed his name in association with this particular film i'd have put it back but no i didn't have my glasses on and therefore i missed it damn i really do need to bring those with me while video shopping first question would be who the heck is the target audience for this it's almost like a scary kids movie but then again there's topless babes and some gore and some bad words spouted here and there the main characters are so cute that you want to see someone anyone go after them with farm implements of some kind seems that a guy opens a bed and breakfast that has a checkered past a child murdering witch that collected children's teeth lived there probably something the real estate agent failed to mention of course now in the modern day there's a little girls ghost around to warn the real live little girl that now lives there that something bad is going to happen it does and there's also two bubbas that were squatting on that property when the new owner took over so they're out for revenge too this whole thing has the feel of some made for cable junk that's for the kids at halloween except for of course the things that aren't suitable for little kids so not only is this mediocre it's confused too a big boo and hiss to anchor bay for putting this out too considering their usual track record with fine releases this is a new low the uk gets a phantasm box set we get the tooth fairy hardly seems fair 1 out of 10 absolute garbage,0
clair denis again revisits her theme of estranged fathers men who follow their own bliss in determined fashion heedless of the emotion toll on their family but while nénette and boni from the earlier film live in a narrow world of marseilles our examination of louis trebor in the intruder takes us from a remote location along the french swiss border to half way around the world to korea and tahiti again the film begins in mid stream with louis in his sixties coping with an ailing heart while attempting to maintain a high level of fitness we learn that louis is no stranger to violence as his cabin is the location for smuggling and gunfire a regular occurrence louis sleeps with a large knife under his pillow with rifles nearby denis is in no hurry to move the action along and we must patiently build our understanding of louis from his daily activities and the few people he deals with along the frontier including a son sidney grégoire colin almost unrecognizable with long hair and a wisp of a mustache who rejects him as a lunatic shown as a dedicated father of two there are many brief scenes which while seemingly unrelated build up an impression of louis and his milieu ms godard's camera work is exhilarating here the controlling metaphor is louis's heart transplant for which he goes to korea and then to tahiti to search for another son not found and where louis's new heart rejects him just as sidney rejected the old we are accustomed to brief scenes in denis's film which are inexplicable nénette astride boni feeding with a spoon a drive by shooting of boni's father and then the briefest of images of boni with a gunshot wound in the head a scene of louis in a morgue with a cadaver with the scar of a transplant but the body of sidney the implication of the last two is a rejection real or imagined by a father kills something indefinable in a son,1
someone release this movie on dvd so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the so called films of the 1990's and see how vapid they were for the most part and how lars von trier tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece as it stands zentropa or europa as it is referred to outside the us is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the bleakness and almost psychotic uncertainty that oozed out of post wwii europe namely the decimated german landscape whose physical horrors were matched only by the damage to the psyche of its people von trier brilliantly paints his vision on screen you will feel like you are watching some lost espionage noir classic from the late 1940's with the perfectly lighted black and white scenes while at the same time feel you are on the brink of something beyond the cutting edge especially in scenes like the assassination aboard the train literally when you see this movie you are witnessing the evolution of an art form br br for some reason von trier got caught up in his own dogma movement shortly after this and while his breaking the waves and dancer in the dark are classics in their own right it is with zentropa that he truly lifted the art of film making to new and exciting heights 10 10 ages like a fine wine and begs for a dvd release,1
i've now just realised that by watching this film i have lost valuable precious moments of my life i will never get back thsi film isn't just poor its dire it reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made br br i regret watching this film br br flixmedia reckons its a race issue apparently white people don't like it because it doesn't have white actors mate i think you'll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of drivel br br please stop making crap films,0
i honestly don't understand how tripe like this gets made the worst junior high talent show skit you've ever seen is more entertaining than this film will ferrell's wrestling fetish provides the only briefly humorous moments utterly horrible,0
enjoyed the movie and efficient confucian crime drama the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man no doubt representing modern society i thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big d was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long i loved the scene and for once in a chinese movie the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest on thing that always amuses me about hk films is that the main influence the british seem to have had is to introduce 'yes sir' and 'sorry' into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone they are still there,1
you are warned this is a spoiler this movie is so bad that i doubt i can write enough lines great direction the shots were well thought out the actors were very good particularly richard pryor tho i would have liked to have seen more of him madeline kahn and john houseman were classic dudley more god bless him could have done better john ritter again i would have liked to see more of him in my opinion this failure is due totally to writer failure maybe the producer could have pulled the plug once he saw what he was creating its just too bad that so much money went into this boiler when with a little change here and there would in my opinion fixed it they must have paid the writers standard rates to produce one chuckle,0
i can't think of much to say about this film br br this was an awful movie i can't even tell you what made me decide to view it it had so few redeeming qualities that i don't even know where to begin br br the plot moved from implausible to downright absurd my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done by the end of the movie i found myself feeling beyond relieved br br the editing was poor the acting was sub par and the storyline was weak francoise robinson was cast as a native american even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage br br if a movie is going to be this idiotic it should be laughably stupid at the very least it wasn't it was just pathetic,0
there are movies and there are films movies are more often than not merely cinematic candy whereas films are true works of art fraulein doktor is certainly well placed in the latter as most viewers i was highly impressed with the battle scenes but the poignancy of the portrayal of the central character is what i consider to be the most sterling quality of the film having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of deutschland all the while in the throes of morphine addiction die fraulein is treated very shabbily by the german high command despite all of her efforts the scene in which the doktor is being conveyed in the rear seat of a mercedes benz command auto alone desolate and sobbing is perhaps one of the saddest yet truest depictions of a spy's lot in life only the emotional pain presented by richard burton in the spy who came in from the cold comes close fraulein doktor is a far deeper film than one may realize upon a singular viewing i only wish that its producers would see fit to release it on dvd so that those who have never experienced it can and those who have seen it can again perhaps again and again enjoy this exceptional motion picture,1
well cube 1997 vincenzo's first movie was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas that i've ever seen when talking about movies they had just one scenery a bunch of actors and a plot so what made it so special were all the effective direction great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal like rats in a labyrinth his second movie cypher 2002 was all about its story but it wasn't so good as cube but here are the characters being tested like rats again br br nothing is something very interesting and gets vincenzo coming back to his 'cube days' locking the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room but instead of a thriller sci fi even some of the promotional teasers and trailers erroneous seemed like that nothing is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world we're living once again vicenzo amaze us with a great idea into a so small kind of thing 2 actors and a blinding white scenario that's all you got most part of time and you don't need more than that while cube is a claustrophobic experience and cypher confusing nothing is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperate br br this movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget of course that the movie fails sometimes but its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaws there's nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that i had in movies since cube,1
a very good adaptation of the novel by amrita pritam urmila and manoj bajpai have given their best br br there is a natural flair in the movie and i felt it right through it looked like bollywood finally gave away it's glamor and had some quality artists performing on screen br br content wise the movie depicted very much what exactly happened during partition by showing the sufferings of a particular family and also shows that trust in one's life goes beyond religion br br the best part was they did not make it a drama with a lot of tear shedding and melodrama br br i simply loved it,1
i got the dvd very cheap and i'm a total drewbie and thats probably the only constellation where this movie could ever interest anyone br br an early drew movie she's looking great and she gets a quite lot of really cute scenes of her like a shower scene a sexy dance scene quite a number of sexy outfits etc she does never show the friendly charm we know from her more recent movies br br the movie itself is pretty average or sub average and much more looking like being made for the tv than one for the cinema there is no real horror or tension built up and the dialogs are often cheesy br br the most interesting part is probably the end because i honestly don't understand it but maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway but at least you don't get the end you would be expecting and it also comes much sooner than one would have expected br br overall i think this movie is exclusively for drewbies,0
although there is melodrama at the center or rather at the bottom of this film the story is told beautifully and subtly and the acting is superb br br yaara studying at princeton returns to her native israel for the funeral of her oldest and dearest friend talia because yaara practically lived with her friend's parents after the death of her own mother she has lost her adoptive sister and because yaara blind from birth has been guided and guarded by talia her friend's suicide is as unbearable as it is inexplicable br br inevitably the blind girl is the one who determines to solve the mystery of this death though without sight she has insight though she cannot see she is able to find what is out of sight than the normal people around her the film thus becomes an absorbing mystery as yaara scours for clues in memories of her relationship with talia in her adoptive family's house in tapes diaries and people in talia's past and present br br told from yara's point of view the film is also seen from her point of view as she visualizes what she hears believes and imagines the solution to the mystery is rather conventional but the search is conducted with such subtle care and the answer rendered so beautifully and without fanfare that the pat moment is easily forgiven the truths emerge gradually yet inexorably clarifying not only talia's life but also her relationship with yaara tali sharon as yaara uses her mobile face and voice effectively and is utterly believable as both the adult and teenage girl we accept fully her ability by the film's end to find her place in the world more confidently br br noteworthy is the precision by which places and actions are repeated with small but significant variations that never become tedious the dead on acting by the minor characters and the interesting decision to represent talia only as a teenager i will quibble with yaara's final declaration as stands with gadi talia's last boyfriend at a cliff's edge but that trip to the edge is so fascinating that the image will remain in sight longer than her words will be recalled,1
my take a funny take on the lion king posing as a sequel surprisingly amusing br br surprisingly lion king 1 1 2 is actually another funny straight to video that's worth a theatrical treatment i don't see why disney released this straight to video and release crappy movies like chicken little and return to neverland theatrically those movies are better off seen in the video stores in the new releases area rather than seeing their theatrical posters outside the theaters br br this one is merely a spoof of the first film although the events in simba's pride hasn't taken place yet on timon voiced by nathan lane and pumbaa's voiced by ernie sabella point of view we get to see them make fun of the events in the first film original voices from the first film like matthew broderick woopie goldberg cheeche martin and robert guillaume return to their voicing roles from the first film while julie kavner and jerry stiller give some hilarious comedy relief as timon's mom and grumpy uncle br br so doesn't this sound fun maybe not now but go watch it for yourself the fact that it's not that serious in its plot makes it the more enjoyable it's kinda like mst3000 with timon and pumbaa br br video movie rating 1 2 out of 5,1
this horrible the acting costumes production values editing the script everything about this film is as bad as it can get it looks as if it was filmed with a video camera can you give a movie a negative rating watch the ring instead,0
wow this film had a huge impact on me it moved me it is an amazing story about a girl in cambodia who is sold into the sex trade i can not stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named holly the setting of the film is realistic the film was an eye opener i can not imagine anyone walking away from it with out wanting to help make a change with this horrifying problem that exsists br br the content of the film was very very moving it was one of the best films that i have seen this year the br br girl who plays holly does a fantastic job with her character ron livinston gives a fantastic performance the film moved me to tears it tells an important message that needs to be heard worldwide everyone should go see this film i think this film will make a difference i loved it,1
i've read a few books about bonnie and clyde and this is definitely more accurate than the beatty dunaway version in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang particularly well done is the death of buck barrow and the capture of his wife blanche this actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of blanche grieving over her dying husband however this movie is still hollywood and our anti heroes stay pretty to the end even after being shot full of holes in life bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death the script is tedious and the acting is poor particularly the leads very disappointing stick with beatty and dunaway their's may not be the true story but it's a great film,0
it wasn't the most pointless animation film experience ever but it certainly can't be admired as much as it tries to be good combining dreamworks animation and computer graphics this is the story of a mustang later named spirit matt damon providing the first person narration and his journey through across the frontiers of the old west basically he is born free amongst all the other horses in the beautiful countryside then he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse he manages to throw off all who try to ride him however when he escapes his cage along with little creek daniel studi the two of them form a friendship oh and he obviously has a thing for little creek's female horse in the end after a few more escapes being chased by the colonel james cromwell and his men and making a final big leap across a gorge little creek lets spirit go and he also releases his female horse and they run home to their countryside and fellow horses also starring chopper bernet as sgt adams jeff lebeau as murphy railroad foreman john rubano as soldier richard mcgonagle as bill and matthew levin as joe i was expecting to see the horses talk in this film but it turns out to be more like a dumbo thing throughout and the songs by bryan adams aren't the most engaging but it isn't a terrible film it was nominated the oscar for best animated feature and it was nominated the golden globe for best song for bryan adams' here i am okay,0
i had absolutely nothing to do the past weekend and tagged along with my friends to check out a movie any movie and since the only movie we'd not seen was inspector gadget we decided to go in for that br br big mistake this is a movie that might appeal only to kids oh and it's not like i don't enjoy movies targeted at the younger audience but this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention if you have nothing to do at home go to sleep better than wasting hard earned cash on this go check out the film if you're a kid or if you're a parent with a kid,0
although the production and jerry jameson's direction are definite improvements airport '77 isn't much better than airport 1975 slick commercial rubbish submerging this time literally a decent cast jack lemmon is the pilot of a packed airliner which gets hijacked by art thieves and crashes into the sea all the publicity claimed it was near the bermuda triangle but there's no mention of it in the film itself when the rescue ships come to raise the airplane out of the water we see all their cranes dropping rather blindly into the ocean and it's hard not to laugh imagining the cranes plugging the plane the passengers and the waterlogged script nbc used to air what appeared to be the director's cut with at least an hour of extra footage mostly flashbacks injected into the proceedings with all the subtlety of a gilligan's island episode most exciting moment is the plane crash and some of the players have a little fun lee grant is an obnoxious drunk brenda vaccaro a no nonsense stewardess joseph cotten and olivia de havilland are flirting oldsters still the personality conflicts and the excruciating military detail eventually tear at one's patience from,0
david duchovny plays the lead role in this film now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn't even bother watching it very unfair to say the least david made his name on the x files and is a decent actor dr eugene sands duchovny is a drug addicted doctor struck off for malpractice by sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire raymond blossom however the fbi take an interest in using eugene to snare blossom angelina jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare the gangsters moll she puts in a solid performance timothy hutton playing blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character duchovny himself isn't as bad as many people would think and in the end i would rate his performance his credible his familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present but dosen't detract too much from the film,1
even though there are no new episodes and it is rarely showed i used to love the magic of sabrina and the teenage witch i never got to see the last episodes but i do want to know what happened to miles or josh and why did the aunts have to disappear out of the show for good i'm sure the ending went to be perfect but there are a lot of questions unanswered and i want to see the last episode of s t t w because i heard she decides between erin and harvey on her wedding day i really hope that she picks harvey and may i say nate richart is hott too bad hes too old for me though melissa joan hart has her own sense of cuteness that she adds to the show but there are many little stupid things for the show such as how famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs and all the cast is listening its kind of stupid plus the cat starts to really get lame as the show continued the jokes began just to get stupid and the things that the audio controlled audience would laugh at i would think it was so lame don't get me wrong at some parts it was funny but i think the show just kind of lost its magic so to speak as the show went on i give kudos to all the cast though for trying although that soleil moon frye girl had no taste and she was a horrid actress i wonder what melissa or any of the cast is doing now for that matter now that the show has ended,1
ray liotta and tom hulce shine in this sterling example of brotherly love and commitment hulce plays dominick nicky a mildly mentally handicapped young man who is putting his 12 minutes younger twin brother liotta who plays eugene through medical school it is set in baltimore and deals with the issues of sibling rivalry the unbreakable bond of twins child abuse and good always winning out over evil it is captivating and filled with laughter and tears if you have not yet seen this film please rent it i promise you'll be amazed at how such a wonderful film could go un noticed,1
and it's not because since her days on clarissa explains it all that i've had a bit of a crush on melissa joan hart who at the time this show was popular was already well into her 20s but was still able to get teenage roles sabrina the teenage witch was hart's next big leap after her clarissa days based on the comic strip sabrina spellman is you guessed it a teenage witch who attempts to balance her witchcraft antics with the demands of everyday teenage life she is aided in her endeavors by her two aunts and a wise cracking black cat as she goes from high school to college and finally to her career in journalism br br as usual hart is the show's heart soul sabrina the teenage witch is quite moving and very funny and it's a shame that it took me so long to realize how great it was i only wish there were some newer episodes that we could all enjoy br br 10 10,1
the beginning of this movie was good it started to get really dumb after he told the people he wanted to kill himself i think if i came from a little town like that i would be offended after seeing this movie they made a lot of these people look dumb and crazy how could these people have so little to do that they follow him around all day a lot of times these people were telling him ways to kill himself like they were urging him to do it how can so many people have little respect for other people i also think they could have made a much better ending for this movie there were some good parts to this movie also some people might like it but i wouldn't recommend this to anyone,0
i bought this while i was playing chess in hastings i am from denmark though it is very good definitely with an understanding of the horror genre the monster towards the end is very scary people who criticise this on imdb should recall that it was a huge succes among serious horror critics br br,1
to say this film is simply a demonisation of catholics and a misrepresentation of history is untrue that is not what this film is br br what this film is is a comment on the abuses of the church although this could be substituted for any powerful body the ways that this abuse affects people and families and the way so many people choose to simply allow and often participate in the abuse without thinking for themselves the fact that it is the catholic church which is in the wrong is simply because of the nature of the true story the film is based upon to label this as propaganda against catholics seems to miss the truth about what the catholic church has done at times its history is often not great and is something that films like this highlight and that needs to be highlighted yes we should comment on the abuses committed by other organisations but that is not for the remit of this film br br it is an amazing film which brought me to tears and well worth watching 'if we do not study the past we are bound to repeat it',1
i should love this movie the acting is very good and barbara stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me the movie makes working class people look low and cheap the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy barbara stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it again the acting was very very good and worth watching i really don't like the story line just a personal preference thank you,0
the final season of roseanne was a roller coaster ride of crazy this final episode does just what a previous comment says it tells us that as much as we might have thought we knew the characters we did not roseanne reaches back to season one and tells us that this show has been her rendition of her life she says in this final episode that she changed events and people as she sees fit scott was not really with leon but he existed mark and david married opposite wives in real life and dan died when she made him live as events happened in her life she changed them in her writing don't we all wish we could do that don't we all have a moment in time that we wish we could just use an eraser and change to our liking this is what she did with the entire episode and to another comment i would say that i don't feel cheated the family was real in my mind she just changed the way that events happened in their lives an a ending to an a show,1
clara lago is wonderful as the title character of the film essentially a film about a spanish american girl who moves to spain with her mom at the time of the spanish civil war it turns out the mother goes home to die and she is left with her grandfather she also makes friends and experiences much in a short time tomiche juan jose ballestra is at first a nuisance to her then they become close the film is shot beautifully bathed in soft colors mostly carol yearns for her dad who is a pilot in the war and you can feel the love sher has for him while the war itself is kind of taken a back seat in this film it envelops the character's lives i think you'll like it see it especially for clara lago who does a great job as carol she is definitely one to watch,1
this is one of the most hateful and cruel movies i've seen in a long time sadly i was duped into sticking with it since donald sutherland's presence misleadingly gave it some credibility that's the last time that'll happen br br lesley ann warren's character was annoyingly whiny and as stupid as they come there were smarter characters than hers who were killed in the film thats just one of many things in this movie that made me ask where is the justice br br why is late night cable so filled with sadistic garbage filled with pathological mayhem most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women and seem to focus on them being terrorized and murdered this film could have been every bit as suspenseful without being sick and twisted in the process all it ends up doing is turning the viewer's stomach with its sickness and insulting the viewer's intelligence br br the cast is misleadingly good my guess is that they bagged sutherland first and used him to lure the others like lemmings into this br br i'm kicking myself for wasting time giving this piece of garbage a chance,0
final score an average of various classic cinematic qualities acting visuals creativity payoff humor fun ect br br 4 3 out of 10 br br had atlantis the lost empire come out a few years ago it would have seemed like a bold serious new direction in disney animation however it comes just a year after the innovative and nearly genius the emperor's new groove and marks a step back in freeing disney from it's repetative disney formula i'm a big fan of the feature length disney animated films have to see them all love it or hate it atlantis is an animated throwback to 20 000 leagues under the sea and similar live action sci fi adventures of the 50s and 60s problem is that this version hardly contains one original idea it feels like a remake of something even more so than actual disney remakes tarzan the hunchback of notre dame the characters are little more than a walking cliches of the usual suspects that typically populate these type of films the oddball mechanic the gung ho general the sassy tough women beyond milo thatch fox and rourke garner the supporting cast is flat out obnoxious the movie also suffers from it's succinct pace instead of fleshing it out into an epic story disney jams a lot in the usually brief running time brushing over opportunities to develop suspence characters anything really they thow us into this new and wonderous world and barely let us get our barings the awkward pace sometimes makes confusing what is a relatively simple story the animation is dark and dreary and cheap this thing looks like a slapped together saturday morning cartoon let's hope they haven't forgotten that 2d traditional animation can still be wonderous the iron giant among others proved that br br negatives the visuals pace and sheer lack of originality br br positives quite possibly the coolest death scene for a disney villain in a long time it's the creative highlight of the movie,0
drones ethnic drumming bad synthesizer piping children singing the most patronizing world music imaginable this is a tourist film and a lousy one what really kills it is the incoherent sequences india egypt south america africa etc etc no transitions no visual explanation of why we're suddenly ten thousand miles away no ideas expressed in images just a bunch of footage of third worlders with baskets on their heads as another reviewer said walking along endlessly as if that had some deep meaning if these guys wanted to make a 3rd world music video all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of koya were shot and film in mexico that would have been a much better setting for life in transformation br br but no what they decided on was a scrambled tourist itinerary covering half the globe and mind deadeningly overcranked filter shots the only thing to recommend this film is that it doesn't suck quite as much as naqoyqatsi br br rstj,0

i've seen many of guy maddin's films and liked most of them but this one literally gave me a headache john gurdebeke's editing is way too frenetic and apart from a tour de force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object does nothing but interfere with the actors' ability to communicate with the audience br br another thing i disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than maddin's earlier works though his films have always had dark elements his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity this one seemed more like harshness for harshness' sake br br as i'm required to add more lines of text before imdb will accept my review i will mention that the actor playing guy maddin does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well,0
okay like many other such films spawned out of a snl skit but tim meadows does a fairly fantastic job of making a 3 minute one dimensional character into a moderately viable comedic movie character he drops amusingly consistently threated one liners with fair frequency billy dee williams is in it though his lando days are long gone and the entire thing is shot pretty well true it's not great art but if you went into wayne's world looking for the gone with the wind you did something wrong enjoyable for what it is,1

first be warned that i saw this movie on tv and with dubbed english which may have entirely spoiled the atmosphere however i'll rate what i saw and hope that will steer people away from that version i found this movie excruciatingly dull all the movie's atmosphere is lost with dubbing leaving the slow frustration of a stalker movie i'm sorry but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow except when the movie about philosophy i didn't see any deep philosophical meaning in this movie maybe i missed something but i have to tell it like i see it i rated it a 1 what can i say u s oriented tastes maybe,0
i saw this at dances with films and it was awesome i really felt for jake talk about adding insult to injury not only are your parents getting divorced but there's a monster after you br br it was both heartfelt and scary there were several moments where the audience screamed in genuine fright it kind of reminded me of a japanese horror film except that the story was actually good br br and that's what separated jake's closet from the usual indy film pabulum an excellent script with compelling characters also by mixing elements of the horror film with family drama the movie gets the best out of both genres and avoids the clichés of both br br if it's not coming out in theaters definitely get the dvd,1
this movie grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence which tricked me into a complete reversal of perspective so i was hooked by the time the title came on the theme of this movie is that everyone is acting trying to re invent themselves but not in a tricky way like identity or the usual suspects but in the way we all try to make whatever banal life we find ourselves in a little more interesting the scenes in the chicken warehouses are spectacular at one point jorgen who owns the chicken farm attends a seminar in laughing where he's the worst student his discomfort at this lets you see the depth of his yearning to change himself the movie made me wonder about the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the most commonplace people i see every day there's not a lot of plot here guessing the old man's secret is pretty easy but the fascination lies in trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they figure it out this movie appealed to me in the same way that sideways did although the characters couldn't be more dissimilar,1
jason alexander is a wonderful actor but it's ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead the fact that he dances so well croons so effectively and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy in his more cutesy moments with the girl in the train station in the final number with rosie i couldn't take my eyes off him he was so repellent you keep expecting him to drop the nice guy act and start snarling vanessa williams was the real star the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie by the way if you see a production of the stage musical the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie you'll see three versions that have more revisions different songs same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations than any other musical i've ever seen,0
this movie leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story i too cannot understand why people would trash this movie br br if you are a jerry bruckheimer fan this movie may not suitable for u br br this movie presents high degree of realism the actors and actresses' performance is examplary not fake just natural br br no special sound effects so special side effects br br the camera work is excellent the music is oh so good i can't wait to get the soundtrack br br it leaves your body numb like constant garderner the directly has raw talent certainly not a follower,1
this is my first cg animated film that i've ever seen usually the look of other animated films made me reticent to see them not ice age i wanted to see it the moment i saw the trailer with scrat the hilarious sabertooth squirrel br br ice age was sporadically funny and overall fun film to watch the story is basically an animated version of three men and a baby set 20 000 years in the past the visuals were great simply beautiful it's one thing to create convincing aninmation it's another thing altogether to create visually arresting stuff and ice age is great to look at with its stylized visuals blue sky studios is a company to look out for in the future,1

who in their right mind does anything so stupid as this movie br br accidental killing of a security guard characters that are so two dimensional that a two year old could have painted drawn them and better br br a red toolbox of death please br br hypothermic weak thugs br br acting from hell br br stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy thriller voyeurism and female uhm rambo br br unbelievable and it's an insult to any thinking person do not watch walk away it's more horrible than you may imagine br br and on top of it all it's trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it's violence br br mrs montford shoot 'em up was fun and funny this is just pathetic and terrible good luck next time,0
a friend of mine bought this film for £1 and even then it was grossly overpriced despite featuring big names such as adam sandler billy bob thornton and the incredibly talented burt young this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole it uses tired bottom of the barrel comedic techniques consistently breaking the fourth wall as sandler talks to the audience and seemingly pointless montages of 'hot girls' br br adam sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women when the ship's resident comedian the shamelessly named 'dickie' due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender is presumed lost at sea sandler's character shecker gets his big break dickie is not dead he's rather locked in the bathroom presumably sea sick br br perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time,0
the film is about a young man michael who cares for the elderly one day he decides to kill some of the relatives of his clients around the same time he decides to model his killing after the zodiac killer of the 60's he gets in touch with the author of a book about the zodiac killer and they form a friendship michael has a gun aparently the only gun as it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors only not portrayed as the same gun and he goes out a killin' original br br this is a great film if you like b movies i thought the idea of the movie was good but the editing and the acting really drowned the plot i thought the 'blood' was just too fake the lighting was horrible in some places and the dialog was just too standard the movie was shot on video which is okay but the editing of the film just made for some weird 'plan 9' scenes not a bad movie for fans of the b movie genre but if you want something with a bit more polish move on to something else,0
just to mention one more thing about gentleman jim i agree with all the assessments that make this among errol flynn's greatest outings in a career of great outings i would think this role playing boxer jim corbett is more like his real personality than the swashbucklers he was typecast as flynn seemed like a party animal from his memoirs and was one guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life the extra thing i wanted to point out is notice the great montages transitions and still inserts that punctuate the film although the director was raoul walsh a frequent collaborator with flynn with cinematographer sid hickox the montages were made up by an up and coming editor named don siegel i never knew siegel went that far back but he's listed right in the credits he would go on to a great career as action director himself,1
we taped this when it aired on tv back in 1995 and have waited all these years for its release for it quickly became one of our family favorites the kids are now teens and must have seen it a ba zillion times yet they still watch it religiously with friends it's timeless appeal reaches across all ages groups similar to grease br br vanessa williams is spectacular jason alexander delightful and wonderfully light on his feet i've noticed other commentators on this site are pretty rough on him but our family gives him top ratings we loved his 'giant step' number marc kudisch as conrad supplies us with comedic relief and wonderful musical numbers and brigitta dau as ursula just flat steals the show probably our favorite character in the entire movie br br the one disappointment was chynna philip's performance of kim part of that has to do with the writing kim's role is completely one dimensional complicating that philip's delivery is flat unimaginative unbelievable and just plain awful the director should have seen that and corrected it or never cast her to begin with br br overall though the picture is delightful and i highly recommend it for families of all ages,1
the sopranos was probably the last best show to air in the 90's its sad that its over its was the best show on hbo if not on tv not everything was spelled out for you throughout you had to think it was brilliant the cast was excellent tony james gandolphini is a great actor and played his character excellent as well as the others each character had flaws thats what made them so real and allowed the viewers to connect with them and thats one reason it lasted so long the last episode was good i'm not sure how to take it many different things can be construed by the ending id like to think that tony didn't die but meadow walked in and sat down with them and that the blackout was just for suspense tony will have to go to trial and deal with that hopefully is not dead thats how i feel long live the sopranos and tony soprano,1
okay so the plot is on shaky ground yeah all right so there are some randomly inserted song and or dance sequences for example adam's concert and henri's stage act and leslie caron can't really um you know act br br but somehow 'an american in paris' manages to come through it all as a polished first rate musical largely on the basis of gene kelly's incredible dancing talent and choreography and the truckloads of charm he seems to be importing into each scene with caron he needs to because she seems to have a problem with emoting br br the most accomplished and technically awe inspiring number in this musical is obviously the 16 minute ballet towards the end of the film it's stunningly filmed and kelly and caron dance beautifully but my favourite number would have to be kelly's character singing 'i got rhythm' with a bunch of french school children then breaking into an array of american dances it just goes to prove how you don't need special effects when you've got some real talent br br not on the 'classics' level with 'singin' in the rain' but pretty high up there nonetheless worth the watch,1
okay this is stupid they say their not making another nightmare film that this is the last one and what do they do they go on making another one not that the next one part7 was bad but why do they play us anyway this movie made no sense what so ever it was extremelly dull the characters were highly one dimensional freddy was another joker which is very stupid for such a good series the plot is very very bad and this is even worse than part 2 and 5 i didnt get the movie its a stupid tale in 3 d pointless id say i hated this film so much i still rmember all the parts i didnt like which was basically the whole film this is so different than the prequels it tries and tries but this one tried the hardest and got slapped back on the face again there were hadly any death scenes although they were different they sucked bigtime how can they have gone this far didnt they see they made the biggest mistakes at parts 2 and 5 yet they make this its all bout the money do not see this sad excuse for a nightmare series br br i gave a nightmare on elm street six 6 3 out of 10 br br good points of movie had potential with plot br br bad points of film terrible acting lack of deaths too funny to be classified as horror very confusing,0
sort of family parody blending an officer and a gentleman heartbreak ridge full metal jacket and without doubt other movies i am not able to remember now into a rather dull movie with some bright spots the gags are always there where you would expect them and damon wayans's lines are well predictable as i said unfortunately this movie never surprises you,0
i felt brain dead i'll tell you this is the worst film i have ever bought in my ignorance i thought this was the peter jackson film of the same name the performances are so terrible they are laughable the special effects have not stood the test of time and look dire the script promotes that kind of tv movie stare into the middle distance kind of acting the cast look as if they have been taking lessons from joey tribbiani they have one look each and stick to it plus i have never been confused by a movie until i sat down to watch this the is it a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within a few minutes avoid like a plague,0
this was the worst movie i've ever seen yet it was also the best movie sci fi original movie's are supposed to be bad that's what makes them fun the line i like my dinosaur meat well done is probably the best quote ever also the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream i can imagine it now the writers waking up after a long night of getting high and playing dance dance revolution then putting ideas together for this space marines got to alien planet which is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it to protect a science team studying the planet best idea ever in fact in fits the complete sci fi original movie checklist guns dinosaurs medieval times space travel terrible acting br br so go watch this movie but don't buy it,1
after losing the emmy for her performance as mama rose in the television version of gypsy bette won an emmy the following year for bette midler diva las vegas a live concert special filmed for hbo from las vegas midler who has been performing live on stage since the 1970's proves that she is still one of the most electrifying live performers in the business from her opening number her classic friends where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap styled number called i look good she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections the section of the show where she salutes burlesque goes on a little too long but she does manage to incorporate her old sophie tucker jokes here to good advantage even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it but her ad libbing until she remembers it is hysterical bette also treats us to rose's turn from gypsy and the title tune from her smash film the rose as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie the first wives club she brings the house down near the end with stay with me baby from the rose and her only 1 hit record wind beneath my wings from beaches it's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for midler fans it's a must,1
ok i didn't have high expectations but this film descending into depths i could not imagine br br the plot as it were involved a priest of an obscure 2 member order investigating the death of the founder of the order by a sin eater the sin eater allows for catholics to achive salvation outside the authority of the church and is yet another immortal in film with loads of ennui nevermind that this makes no sense since then a baptist could give you salvation we'll move on br br i'll layout the plot w o giving much away the priest goes to rome with his buddy to investogate he brings with him a mental patient i'm not making this up who shot him during an excorism and who loves him not one lick of this btw is explained a drunk irish priest and peter weller as a cardinal they get to rome find some creepy kids who do nothing in the film meet with a bondage gear s m anti pope that the drunk irish guy knows not explained and who gives information by killing people oh btw he's a bad guy so he has an industrial techno soundtrack and then umm seriously i'm not sure the plot meanders about heath chills with the sin eater flies to new york with the sin eater for an overnighter and then some other stuff happens and then all off camera the anti pope falls and the film ends br br about 1 hour into the film one really wonder if anything has happened by the end something has happened but you can't be at all certain that it matters and since most of the drama takes place either before the movei or off scren you're really feeling cheated,0
this film is a delightful light hearted look at both sides of where the club kid rave scene blends with the new york art music and performance art worlds with a cameo by the omnipresent miss bunny this is torch song trilogy for the perky post teen girls that girl for our disaffected affected millennium times br br the dialogue is fast and funny and parker posey's costumer deserves if not an academy award at least a stadium wave of kudos br br of course this film rests on the very stylish platform heels of miss posey and she is perfectly cast like a lot of her acting work it may not be very deep it is often self referential and well posey but it all works she is a talented comedienne an incredible entertainer and this film entertains she carries it on her shoulders like a faux leopard wrap and never lets it drop to the floor br br mary is a superficial party fashionista who isn't above stealing designer clothing from a friend's closet or making out with someone else's boyfriend on a deeper level this is a story of a girl and her friends who are care less in every sense of the word including about other people and the process of learning that caring is necessary to life br br the script is beautifully crafted witty and the only performance that disappoints is the aunt in a role that was much too one dimensional and heavy handed a more nuanced performance from her would have deepened the relationship between the two but hey this is comedy a surprisingly deep role that gives this film some substance and world vision is the fallafel selling boyfriend we should all be so lucky is he the one for mary or the one that gets away br br i rate this as a 8 because it isn't a great moment of film history it is not a classic and it is not great art all of which get deeper and richer on re viewing like desperately seeking susan it represents something very true about it's time period but may become irrelevant with time still it has everything an entertaining film needs and is worth viewing several times for the clothes alone,1
this film is a stunning piece that will convince even the most skeptical viewer that gerard depardieu is one of the finest film actors of the last 50 years his performance shocks entertains disgusts and charms you while leaving you breathless this film was shot in the very early days of his film career and is very raw but still is able to convey the mastery of depardieu a must see for any depardieu fan and by far his best early work,1
i will never forget the wit and great comedy of the original vacation movie the lines pacing and timing of events in that film are outstanding however this european vacation sequel is a major let down br br in this sequel the griswalds win a european vacation on a game show the problem is that many of the jokes in the film are little more than mild ha ha laughs for example a flight attendant on an airplane asks clark do you want your coke in the can clark answers back no i'll have it right here that's really about the only line that is funny in this film br br european vacation's humor is strained as if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first movie tried to re hash a script that had been done before and relied on a ridiculous slap stick chase scene sequence toward the end of the picture just to kill time br br worse the natural comic standouts like randy quaid as cousin eddie and the original kids who played rusty and audrey from the first movie so well are nowhere to be found their replacements are not funny can't act and just look like they are going through the motions most of the time there are also a few crude sex jokes and comments that are not only not funny they are in bad taste br br the griswald's should have stayed in wally world the place that made them legends don't join them on this european dreadful adventure viewers should re watch the original vacation movie in place of this you'll be glad you did,0
wow the sort of movie you could watch ten times and still delight in its nuances absolutely incredible if this was visconti's debut film i shudder to think what would happen if he got any better from film to film the only other one of his i've seen at time of writing is death in venice which was absolutely incredible more dazzling visually than ossessione obsession one of the most beautiful films i've ever seen but its story was not as involving as ossessione if you click on miscellaneous on this page's links there are stills from the movie on those websites they won't really do justice to the experience of the movie such graceful camera movements such beautiful composition such wonderful faces such terrific characters such a great story development the first movie adapted from james m cain's the postman always rings twice br br i can't believe this was made in 43 eight years before brando was supposed to have introduced realistic acting to the world with streetcar named desire 1951 the actors in this may not have used the method technique ie they may not have truly felt everything themselves i don't know anything about it but they're some of the best most genuine and realistic performances up to this date in cinema also eight years before streetcar named desire brought a new sensuality to the screen ossessione was electrifyingly sensual the most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema yes i'm being superlative but ossessione was just that terrific br br the reason ossessione didn't cause the impact streetcar did was that it was made in fascist italy and banned by mussolini and re cut in america american audiences didn't see its full glory till 59 eight years after streetcar br br i won't say any more about it just writing to tell you its one of the best most beautiful and exciting movies i've ever seen and tell you to go out and see it like another reviewer i'm going to buy it as soon as i can find it,1
silly often ridiculous romp involving the landing of a space ship and the resulting havoc this causes on tim jeff daniels and the people in his orbit br br am always amazed by daniels he showed such depth and promise in 1983's terms of endearment as shirley maclaine's philandering son in law as the years have passed daniels has been unable to get his hands on a good meaty role instead he is in inane comedies such as dumb and dumber br br as for this picture it fails because of the subject matter at least the television show brought about a variety of situations in the film we have constant slapstick and people turning into monsters as the government is thwarted into capturing the martian martin br br the part of mrs brown is a perfect example of the non success of the film on television pamela britton portrayed a ditsy individual caught up in situations with the martian leaving her perplexed in the film version a blond bomb shell as brown tries romantic entanglement br br television star ray walston has a small role as a government agent or is he really that br br a very big disappointment for those who enjoyed the television show so much,0
the dukes of hazzard will academy awards best actor and actress 4 the persons who can say with a straight face that this was a great movie br br this movie was a torture to watch so sad how an weekly half hour entertainment was destroyed by these amateurs the only good thing about this crap was the car i remember when daisy was a real threat to look 4ward 2 who's the moron that decided that jessica simpson is hot we know she can't act but come on in the tv show daisy was a fox and brunette br br all members who contributed in these waste of time please please please don't even think about makin a sequel a prequel or anything that's got 2 do with a former tv show br br i gave a empty dvd so this movie could be burned 4 me i sat trough it and i want my money back,0
films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning while there are some exceptions the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes the kids in paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds as they're both very annoying and they don't have an ounce of acting ability between them in short they're rubbish this isn't good considering that they're the leads and it especially isn't good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors it's a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isn't not completely it follows a young girl who after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created it soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings and so sets about making various changes until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare oh dear br br as you can see this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie however it is squandered through a number of fatal faults first and foremost in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness the movie is extremely stale the central plot is hardly played with at all and the result is an entirely boring experience the lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just don't care any more which is due to a lack of ideas thanks in part to it's lead characters the film feels like a kids movie throughout this is to be expected as it stars kids but bernard rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story as the horror in the movie is laughable at best the film is also very cheesy and the 'romance' between the two leads is extremely cringe worthy and makes for very painful viewing in fact if i had to sum this travesty up in one word i would choose 'painful' paperhouse is poorly acted laughably plotted very corny and dull on the whole save yourself the pain see something else,0
this movie down shifts from 4th into 1st without bothering with 3rd or 2nd grinding gears all the way to the sappy b movie finish line the con at the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the movie that is worth seeing the scene with harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast you may miss it definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by robert osborne in his tcm intro to this bad to mediocre confusion there is no real conflict and all of the characters in this supposed fringe society turn out to be saints especially the unbelievable character al i wonder if he's got a job for me in cincinnati,0
what a disgrace i was checking this out hoping it would be an undiscovered james garner gem and what a stinker it turned out to be the production quality was fine but the plot was undeniably lame and i can honestly say that i am only a couple hours older and a lot dumber now the movie really had no redeeming qualities and if this kind of stuff keeps coming out it will give hallmark a bad name for those of you who insist on knowing what it was about it's about nothing and in this case it's not a good thing we are subjected to watching one old ornery woman who is one of the dumbest creatures ever to roam the earth who happens to be married to a real sweetheart who is probably the only person alive that could put up with her she drags him through one mess after another gets him into one embarrassing situation after another and is proud of herself the whole time then the movie ends what a relief that was not worth the time it would take to watch it so do yourself a favor and skip this one you'll be glad you did if you knew how bad this one really is,0
except people apparently buy into this garbage as shows like moral orel have shown even if you tried to make the most outrageous over the top parody of evangelism you could possibly think of it wouldn't come close to the hilarity of this show it's hard to tell what's even going on when you're watching it is it a news show a talk show who knows they start out by reporting on various international news stories but at seemingly random points the news is interrupted by this odd troll like little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face mumbling and laughing and generally being creepy br br pat robertson doesn't even seem like such a bad guy at first glance he just seems like a senile yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs like most of our grandparents but this is a man who has called for an assassination who has befriended and offered aid to not one but two murderous dictators who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mines who has supported forced abortions in china and who regularly implies that caucasians straight american male caucasians in particular are superior to all other races br br still this would all be funny except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later either that or enough money to bribe some tv executives who don't give a damn what they show the idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people somewhere must be watching it and hanging onto every word even when robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is people still listen to him i don't know if it's funny or scary i guess a healthy mixture of both,0
nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing this time it's being brought to you by the never inevitable fred olen ray as far as exploitation movies go this one doesn't click as science fiction it's plain unoriginal all that we see is an an ugly feminine android wearing a bikini out to destroy the earth and showing off all that's nearly bare to resist give me a f ing break if this kind of entertainment is your thing then why not dust off those old si swimsuit mags from the attic for a change this would have been much better if it didn't set the sleaze factor on very high but that still wouldn't make this one great i'd like to point out another film called the assault 1996 by jim wynorski which resembles the identity of alienator it illustrates why top notch 1st person femme fatale action movies don't translate well in america sorry fellas,0
oh dear good cast but to write and direct is an art and to write wit and direct wit is a bit of a task even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right im not putting it all down there were parts where i laughed loud but that was at very few times the main focus to me was on the fast free flowing dialogue that made some people in the film annoying it may sound great while reading the script in your head but getting that out and to the camera is a different task and the hand held camera work does give energy to few parts of the film overall direction was good but the script was not all that to me but i'm sure you was reading the script in your head it would sound good sorry,0
this show is awful no comedy no plot no good characters america are you blind give the award to real shows i hate this show along with 30 rock honestly i'm so glad they canceled this show thank you cbs keep two and a half men keep christine keep rules of engagement keep how i meet your mother which really isn't funny but a lot funnier than this this show is a rip off of friends with the same director so thats okay but keep this show gone and never bring it back never ever ever ever the only reason i didn't give it a 1 rating is because it keep my awake instead of asleep those are the types of movies or tv shows that i give a one the only reason i was still awake was because of the audiences laughter and i was looking forward to the next show i really wish this show was funny sorry but my opinion stupid very stupid i don't see why everyone loves it my opinion again but i also find big bang theory kinda stupid my bad smart the class bye bye now i have a smile and it is not from watching your show,0

i have been a fan of without a trace from the premier episode i really cannot express my disappointment in the episode last week this is a real problem that far too many afican american families have dealt with and continue to deal with the lack of media coverage crucial in the first 48 hours has been documented by a recent study law enforcement including local state and federal are also complicit what was the purpose of advertising this subject matter and then copping out on the ending seemingly television can deal with almost any subject matter except race this is shameful get it together or don't explore it next time,0
republic pictures comes late in the game to the werewolf er werecat genre the plot has a writer returning to paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had blackouts he is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller the french government wants to know if he had access to secret documents something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a catman suspicion really falls on the writer when his fiancé ends up dead complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer doesn't know if he's the killer or not br br okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed there are too many musical numbers early on and too much dead time when things are all talk in the middle and later sections the acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people i know only remember the top hatted killer he's the most interesting thing in this film despite its short running time just over an hour i think the reason that this film was rarely seen on tv was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience with it as good as the talk is i just wished someone would do something when it finally did happen in the closing minutes it was too little too late br br take a pass,0
although i rated this movie a 2 for showing a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror film it was a 10 on the unintentional funny scale i couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were but i didn't care because i knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie but i believe this is because they started filming without a script the fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile it doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be confused with enjoyment i particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks i believe the doctor refers to this as treatment genius,0
star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br mcbain played by gary busey before the name became synonymous with the character in the simpsons is a typically unorthodox cop who gets results but winds his superiors up something rotten avoiding the cliché of his partner being killed at the beginning of the film the plot instead takes a different turn and sees him assigned to travel to mexico where a top secret american super tank with incredible firepower and imaging capabilities has been smuggled through only to be taken hostage along with the crew by a gang of terrorists br br this cheap looking even by 80s standards boring little action film was a bizarre career move for gary busey after making an impression as the flame haired villain mr joshua in lethal weapon he just goes through the motions with his cardboard character here edgy and zany as ever with 'butthorn' being his trademark put down for the bad guys but without the material to back him up henry silva has presence as a screen villain but he's totally miscast here as an arab leader in a red beret and the awful script gives him some really clunky lines of dull dialogue that make his performance come off as laughably wooden he's just one of a host of action film character actors including l q jones and lincoln kilpatrick who pop up but fail to add anything to the mix after a dull first half without much exciting action things do pick up a bit at the end but it's too little too late and none of it manages the task of being any fun,0
just below the surface lies what a simply awful movie is what br br as other viewers have justifiably commented the storm sequences are just plain ridiculous chopping already sodden firewood in the pouring rain now that's smart menace foreboding sexual tension for those read dull contrived dull contrived and dull overly contrived br br i want to say thank god for mia sara's shower scene but in retrospect i think the producers of the film having seen the completed mess realised that they had to put something in to make it half way worthwhile at all so it just becomes yet another contrivance do yourself a favour and give this a miss,0
why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome everyone should know what an excellent movie this is it is engaging and funny from moment one original and well acted i wish the movie was doing itself as good press as it deserves br br for anyone that loved the princess bride labyrinth and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure this is one of the great ones robert deniro is hysterical relative newcomer charlie cox is an incredible leading man claire danes is fantastic as always michelle pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen there are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characters even down to facial expressions,1
the first time i saw this movie i fell in love with it the atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost i expected a gore fest but instead got to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with my head to a chilling soundtrack it's actually my ringer at the moment p the fact that i couldn't predict when he'd kill and when he'd disappear was a major plus in my book predictable horror movies bore me now i know the storyline had some discrepancies but if you're like me you don't even notice them until long after the movie's over and you're laying in bed mauling over the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in motion finally as i mentioned the soundtrack is timeless it's one of my all time favorite theatrical scores so i was very happy to hear that rob zombie is leaving it untouched in his remake speaking of the remake i read a very comprehensive article on it and now that i know that mr zombie reveres john carpenter i have high hopes for his take on this classic this movie is great for any time you have a craving for a spine tingling but it's the perfect addition opener finale you name it for an all hallow's eve movie marathon,1
the first mistake you make in titling a film is to use of the living dead without really having a budget for real zombie fx sure this was a low budget zombie flick really low budget i thought it was a film school project amateur actors and amateur effects br br it was really not too bad considering the above and it presented an interesting twist to the zombie genre if you are going to get an r for violence you might as well give us some good shots of the babes being attacked the women were so little used in this film that it could almost be classified as gay interest br br and i am staying out of oakland there was a heck of a lot of shooting going on and no cops in sight,0
i really enjoyed this documentary about kenny and spencer's attempt to pitch the dawn was a great look at how outsiders try to get to the inside to make it big br br the story was put together well and organized in an interesting manner that made the film flow well certainly worth a watch my only complaint is that their appeared to be no closure perhaps that is part of the point we expect it but in reality that is not what happened or usually happens br br the film is also a great way to see the personality of kenny and spencer outside of their canadian television show you can see a bit of what is yet to come br br i look forward to a chance to see the papal chase,1
well let me go say this because i love history and i know that movie is most important piece in our history and it was beautifully executed movie and julia stiles became my 1 favorite actress after seeing her in the '60s and i own this movie in my video box with many movies and i suggest you to look for her new movies in the future and try to enjoy history,1
the haunted world of edward d wood jr is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as glen or glenda bride of the monster and of course plan 9 from outer space this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries such as look back in angora and the plan 9 companion failed it rounds up his surviving entourage many of whom have passed away since filming and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood sentimental in its treatment of the director down to the haunting music this documentary is an absolute must see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together ed's life and untimely death for the viewer best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater,1
grey matter aka the brain machine but the video people thought better of that the screen says 1972 but imdb says 1977 it's that kind of movie the government has some kind of overriding interest in this 'brain machine' project that has drafted four people who turn out to be roughly a philosopher a horny priest a crackpot veteran and a patriot who got an abortion to sit in a shrinking room with a computer that can read their horrendous secret thoughts in the end the government takes over the lab by force and everybody dies here is a movie that is incompetent in every important way my s has better production values than this it held my interest though just to see what exactly these exploitation filmmakers thought they were doing dabbling in four guys in a room character drama the answer a tract about how science is inferior to god thanks a lot it's like opening a kinder egg and getting your 30th goddam jigsaw puzzle the priest is played by james roscoe p coltrane best the philosopher by gerald the republican simon mcraney also featuring very very very long establishing and transition shots in great quantity this moves almost as slow as the liberal convention,0
this series was cbs networks answer to the success of the big valley it was a 90 minute western just like the abc program was while it was an answer it did not have the stuff to make it past season 2 br br the problem really became reality got lost on this show for example in one episode johnny gets his eye poked out by a stick amazingly by the end of the show johnny had healed entirely along with that the stories on this were no where near as strong as the big valley br br this is a show that i would not want dvds of frankly hope they are never released think since cbs was running out of lots they re used many familiar settings this was one the last western series cbs produced as westerns were not real popular in the 1970's,0
no doubt frank sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer after all very few actors nowadays can get a scene just right in one take and that was pretty much sinatra's modus operandi on set br br i feel that as the 1960's wore on the quality of the man's films really started to tank the tony rome detective series was nothing short of trying to compete with dean martin's matt helm series which came out at the same time perhaps even a james bond competition but nothing really worked for frank during these years his personal life in shambles his music fading out sinatra appeared more like a throwback to the 1950's the last great sinatra film of this period was probably von ryan's express in 1965,0
pretty standard b movie stuff seriously anyone who watches dragon fighter with dean cain and a bunch of people making their first movie should know better than to expect real quality or even moderate intelligence b movies exist to re work formulas that are popular if you give them even token analysis you'll wind up ruining the movie for yourself and perhaps writing some self important slanderous review on imdb br br i liked the female lead kristine byers she had charisma and i thought she was notably attractive it was a memorable b movie appearance unfortunately i don't see where she has made any movies since i'll watch for her again,0
how sad there is no option to post a mark lower than 1 i watched this piece of nonsense and could barely believe what i was watching every single part of the film was awful music acting direction story everything simply everything i actually found myself laughing out loud at various points in the film i particularly loved the bit where our hero is dashing through the hospital in soft focus slow motion and knocks the clipboard out of the nurses hand because well just because product placement crucifix's crucifi everywhere if you are of a christian persuasion and very easily satisfied you may like this movie if you do like this movie you really need to get out more,0
i agree with the last reviewer that this movie had terrible acting yes there was a lot of gore and some nudity but it was overshadowed by a slow moving meaningless plot and dumb ending where was this supposed to be filmed anyway a canadian chinatown or hong kong hostel was a much better movie and i would recommend seeing that instead a technical annoyance i had with the dvd is that if you shut off the spanish subtitles they return after a few scenes and then you have to go back to the main menu and turn them off again also don't waste your time on the deleted scenes because there's no audio and it just looks like tourist footage,0
this film has slipped through the cracks of film history it is by far much better than some other new york films of the same era such as the french connection or the taking of pelham 1 2 3 there is a gritty reality to this film which also manages to effectively use humor to further the plot line it's engaging from start to finish and hasn't tarnished with age as is the case with the above two examples br br ron liebman turns in a bravura performance as batman and it's a shame his career didn't take off as a result of this project br br gordon parks directs and coming as it does after shaft it at first appears to be a strange choice yet it is the flip side of that earlier effort and approached with just as much in your face machismo br br unfortunately this film has not been made available on either dvd or vhs in the united states united artists really has a gem on their hands and it's a shame they're not doing anything with it,1
chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos unfaltering performances rock solid writing and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever br br all of the cast are strong but falco and gandolfini earned every inch of those emmy's anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes particularly from the first few seasons james gandolfini is absolutely fierce absolutely terrifying and you still find yourself loving him mesmerized by him br br many people that i've spoken to about the sopranos who haven't seen it yet will say i'm just not a fan of mafia movies shows whatever run don't walk and get it those same people usually love e r but i bet they don't much care for hospitals it's not about the context,1
i thought that the nadir of horror film making had been reached with book of shadows i was wrong this film makes that look like the magnficiant ambersons compared to this piece of shameless unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie i'd write more but i'm still to angry that i was idiot enough to spend £3 renting it bobbins br br and were these people english and where is the forest i have lived in the uk two thirds of my life and as far as i know there are no dark uncharted woodlands in the midlands the whole bally thing looked like a national trust conifer plantation those angels looked like anorexic pornstars turned most of them were did my research i did however like the bit when judd got ripped in pieces br br p s i love and admire tom savini but he cannot act,0
as an adult i really did enjoy this one i watched it with my 2 granddaughters and the 3 1 2 year old was fascinated and the 15 month old giggled at the mice br br the music is fun and the animation is wonderful this sequel does what return to neverland didn't accomplish a good follow up to the cinderella story but what becomes of drusilla another sequel i hope so,1
i find it rather useless to comment on this movie for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon it's similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it but since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance br br filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other romanian movie directed by lucian pintilie who insists to depict the so called romanian reality following the communist era 1990 to present days br br under no circumstances recommended for people outside romania as for the others who lately find amateurish camera lack of plot lack of directorial actors's quality etc noise etc as being trendy and even art like watch enjoy this movie as i know you will but do the other well intentioned imdb members a favor don't write an online review for it will misguide irritate and in the end waste their time br br on the other hand this movie among others has some value whatsoever an educational one for it sets the example for how not to make a movie,0
i know this sounds odd coming from someone born almost 15 years after the show stopped airing but i love this show i don't know why but i enjoy watching it i love adam the best the only disappointing thing is that the only place i found to buy the seasons on dvd was in germany and that was only the first two seasons that is disappointing but that's ok i'll keep looking online if anyone has any tips on where to buy the second through 14th seasons please email me at darkangel 1627 yahoo com i already own the first one the only down side is that the dvds being from germany they only play on my portable dvd player and my computer oh well i still own it,1
i'm a huge steven seagal fan hell i probably weigh as much as he does although i don't have the street cred to sport the frizzy mullet ponytail having stated my own bias and affection for america's favorite corpulent stage and screen hero it is with a heavy heart that i must declare this to be his worst movie ever i'm not sure he could make a movie any worse than this br br in his defense the major problems with this film seem to occur in post production it's painfully obvious that this movie was supposed to have a different storyline that results in woeful voiceovers in which steve's voice doesn't nearly sync up with that of the dubbed voice the editing is pisspoor and overall this starts bad gets even worse and by the end you'll wish you had rewatched the da vinci code instead yes it's that bad br br after this i don't know what to expect from steve my friends still laugh at me for listening to his cds is it time i start checking out some of the van damme direct to dvd nutty logs if you are tempted to watch this movie rip your eyeballs out and flush them down the toilet a lifetime of darkness is better than 89 minutes of this,0
the intention the directors has for this films are quite honorable but his history of his productions did get me aware that this might not get much to the core like other film makers would do it keeping his great 30 days tv series in mind but also counting in his mtv production i bet you will that opposes his seriousness in any of the matters he documents and also counting in his rather disappointing production supersize me i did not had my hopes up high sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less as with supersize me after a while i did ask myself what exactly the point of all this was the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the playtime gets filled with rather pointless stuff and re repeating stuff that were already shown in this way or another earlier in the movie so it wears out and gets extremely boring towards the end,0
spoiler this movie is about such a concept williams will go to any low in order to replay the football game that haunts his life russel plays the ex jock who peaked in high school finally the under dog get its shot and williams can save face instead of being the clown a great reverse tragedy 7 10,1
it is a great movie if you have ever named your cars or are really into old fast or exotic cars it has a plot and a lot of action the car scenes are great except for the totally fake car jump scene all of the other scenes are great i really enjoyed it and i hope everyone else does as well,1
warning spoilers contained herein br br this is a semi autobiographical look at what might happen to madonna if she were ever to be stranded on a deserted island there's absolutely no challenge to madonna in this role and it shows she's just madonna playing madonna and she can't even get that right i know what you're saying you're saying how do you know this is what madonna is really like you've never met her correct i haven't but we all remember truth or dare don't we i know kevin costner does br br you would think in the year 2002 that madonna might have learned something one way or the other from the crossover ladies that have also made their way across the silver screen for goodness' sake hasn't madonna seen glitter mariah carey showed the film world how it is done mariah kicks madonna's trashy butt to the curb in beauty talent screen presence charisma characterization you name it all we see from this glimpse into madonna's world is she's the only one in it br br if there's one thing to be said for madonna it is that she's consistent when she was an mtv darling she set the world of women's fashion back 20 years now in film she has set women's roles in film and society back 20 years by glamourizing all the most hated horrible reprehensible odious qualities women have been reputed to have locked away inside them qualities they have been so desperately trying to prove they really don't possess br br here's the spoilers don't read any further if you don't want to know br br here's the one good thing i will say about this film and i really was impressed by it they didn't go for the hollywood ending madonna's character lives in the typical happy hollywood ending madonna's character would have died on the island and her long suffering oppressed whipped husband would have been free to finally settle down with a good decent woman a woman who would be the exact opposite of his deceased wife and they both live happily ever after but in this extremely depressing conclusion she is rescued and once more this poor victim of a husband is once again saddled with his demon of a wife and his life will once again become a living hell br br here endeth the spoilers,0
it is a tricky thing to play a queen on the one hand the actress has to be majestic and imperious and on the other she has to show vulnerability in a tough situation as well as the gathering of the courage and resolution to overcome the odds since almost all movies about queens have that basic plot line br br emily blunt is quite radiant as victoria but it's not as full a performance as i'd like no blame to her i can't help but feel like this is a mills boon novel adaptation compared to a darker more dramatic movie about another young queen elizabeth hence blunt doesn't get to run the gamut of queenly emotions at least not to the full extent since she's y'know the young victoria to see the old victoria check out mrs brown br br jean marc vallee is an interesting choice of director for the movie he last did c r a z y which was excellent and propelled him to fame it was quite a different movie but i remember it looking gorgeous and that's probably the main similarity between the two movies but while vallee wrote c r a z y this one was by julian fellowes and though i really enjoyed his gosford park the story for this movie was much less interesting i soon got lost with all the governmental politics maybe it was less engaging because there was no potential beheading of the monarchy i'm just saying,1
the only redeeming part of this movie was the price i paid at least all i lost was 3 00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb the crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat when the female lead and the fbi guy went to the alleged killers location mr fbi handed the female a revolver when the alleged killer came out the door the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic one is left to ponder would an fbp agent hand a weapon to a civilian i think not ms xavier appears to be a very attractive female it is too bad the r rating did not allow much of her to be seen it would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out,0
after buying the dvd in a bargain bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover i popped it in the dvd player and everything looked good nice animated menus and a whole lot of extra features but when i played the movie itself what a let down it is the worst thing i have ever seen and i have seen some bad movies in my time the comment that praises the movie here at imdb is actually from the people who made the film so don't believe it unless you like to waste your cash,0
don't get me wrong dan jansen was a great speed skater if there was one guy who deserved his gold medal at the olympics it was dan br br but how can it be possible that bill corcoran has made such a bad movie about the incredible dan jansen story because the real dan jansen story is truly incredible especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of a sportsman everything is wrong the way matt keeslar and the other actors skate their technique the dimensions of the speedskating oval it is all wrong br br shame on you bill corcoran dan jansen deserves better a lot better br br 1 out of 10,0
this is another fantasy favorite from ralph bakshi after watching it on youtube that is set in the distant past after the ice age it is a prehistoric sword and sorcery quest between good and evil nekron lord of the realm of ice and his mother queen juliana has set their sights on conquest of the known world when their glaciers destroy's the village of a man named larn he larn vows to avenge his people and kill the ice lord meanwhile the sub human minions of nekron and juliana capture firekeep's king jarol's sultry daughter princess teegra but she manages to escape and eventually meets with larn who promises to escort her back to firekeep if the sub humans don't find them first br br this movie did very little box office as did most of ralph bakshi's films but has become a cult classic partly for the quality of the art a collaboration between ralph bakshi and the famed fantasy artist frank frazetta also i have heard that the screenplay was written by gerry conway and roy thomas the two men who had done conan comic book stories and the background painters included james gurney the illustrator of the dinotopia novels though admittedly i had never read conan or dinotopia and also the painter thomas kinkade noted for his artwork for figurines music boxes for the bradford exchange company besides paintings and like bakshi's films the lord of the rings and american pop this movie was rotoscoped but the process works better in this film than in the former br br so overall i think it's one of the best animated fantasy movies ever made and an awesome collaboration between two great minds ralph bakshi and frank frazetta with plenty of fantasy sexual innuendo and thrilling adventure,1
i stumbled across this act i by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago this was'nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned it amazed me it intimidated me it shocked me i eventually forgot about and almost a decade later i happened to think about it again then went and bought both acts they were even better than i had experienced at first br br my only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime warranting tanks and heavy artillery it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals that is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda it certainly has not been shown as such br br i don't think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this but regarding the story there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused,1
one of the worst movies i've ever seen acting was terrible both for the kids and the adults most to all characters showed no little or not enough emotion the lighting was terrible and there were too many mess ups about the time of the day the film was shot in the river scene where they just get their boat destroyed there's 4 shots the sheriff and dad in the evening on their boat jillian and molly in the evening swimming the rest of the kids in the daytime when it's supposed to in the evening at the river bank and the doctor beatrice and simonton at night but not in the evening getting off their boat the best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff cappy although there's a slip of character when the pulse detector whatever that thing is when people die it beeps shows cappy has died he still moves while it can still be heard beeping and while the nurse extra checks his pulse manually then it shows the pulse again and then he finally dies i guess it's not going to be perfect since it's an independent movie but it still could be better not worth watching honestly even for kids might as well watch something good like the lion king or toy story if you're going to see anything you'll remember,0
modern original romantic story br br very good acting of both nicole kidman and ben chaplin br br miss kidman does a nice job in imitating a russian accent ben chaplin is also good as the shy dull clerk for the men and some women miss kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic i forgot what a gorgeous woman she is it's not hard to imagine that john falls in love with her some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense although i hoped for a happy ending the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me br br conclusion good movie br br les pays bas huit points,1
did heidijean really see this movie a great christmas movie not even close dull bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that carly pope could play the lead in this movie the woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with maybe i'm expecting too much for a lifetime movie played 15 days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie,0
the 74th oscars was a very good one whoopi's work as emcee was very funny and light i personally loved her last apperance which garnered some frigid reviews due to coarse language and salacious jokes but that's fine the audience seemed to like it halle berry denzel washington ron howard woody allen and sidney poitier made this an oscar telecast to remember br br,1
i chose to watch this film at tribeca based on judd hirsch and scott cohen and found it to be one of the best movies in the festival both leading actors deliver a well rounded sensitive performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level the director did a great job bringing the characters and story to life with skill that is usually not seen in a first time production br br one interesting aspect of this film is the love of woodwork and new york city brooklyn in specific the movie revolves around the family furniture making business and weaves delicate cinematography of both carpentry and ordinary brooklyn life  again kudos to the director on this fine choice br br this is gem and i would whole heartedly recommend it i'm sure it will make it to the screen,1
the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly shemp moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team br br one of my favorite stooges shorts with shemp is none other than husbands beware all appearing in this short are the beautiful christine mcintyre dee green doris houck alyn lockwood johnny kascier nancy saunders lu leonard maxine gates and emil sitka green and mcintyre provide great performances here there are so many funny parts here this is a very hilarious short there is another similar three stooges short like this one called brideless groom and i recommend both,1
what happens when someone has so much social anxiety that they cease to function how alone can one man get when the mundane crap we have to do in order to be part of society gets to be too much what happens frownland explores these questions definitely a startling original debut from bronstein the tone is strange and claustrophobic as we get inside the mind of a guy named keith that is so messed up he can hardly form a proper sentence we follow him around as he tries to make contact with people and function day to day most of us have known people like this people that say sorry too much or i appreciate it when there's nothing to appreciate so we know there are people out there like this but why would someone want to make a movie about them well because its interesting and bronstein and the lead actor dore mann do an excellent job this film is about as un commercial as a film can get a few friends filmed it over the course of a few years as they saved money it was shot on 16mm and the scratched film look is beautifully low budget with no distributer this may be a tough one to find i think it's been screening randomly for the past year or so hopefully it'll be on dvd at some point i saw it at the silent movie theater here in la there were 10 people in the audience among them crispin glover if that tells you anything about how weird this movie is highly recommended,1
garam masala is one of the funniest film i've seen in ages akshay kumar is excellent as the womaniser who has affairs with 3 girls and engaged at the same time john abraham is amusing at times and this is one of his best works so far paresh rawail is superb as usual in most of his films the director priyadarshan has delivered great movies in the past hera pheri hungama and hulchul being some of the best garam masala is his funniest film he has made the three newcomer actresses are average rimi sen doesn't get much scope in this movie i was impressed to see how priyadarshan made a movie with a simple storyline of a guy having a affair with 3 girls at the same time all 3 girls have a day off in the same day and end up in the same house packed with loads of laughs this is one non stop entertainer,1
i really looked forward to see planet of the apes but it was a huge dissapointment br br the settings and masks are great but that is the only good aspect of the film all other things are really annoying mark wahlberg is not acting he is just in the movie looking stupid the other actors are also not very good br br but the worst point of all is the story it is absolutely ridiculous for example the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground but the humans don t attack them no they wait until they are up again this is just one example for the stupid story but it would take too long to tell them all,0
i watched the unrated version of this film and realised about 30 minutes into it that i was never getting my time back i persevered to the end hoping that the dialogue would improve the martial arts would look realistic eventually the special fx would actually look special i was so wrong i love horror i am a complete gore hound i number some of the eighties splatter flicks amongst the greats of the film world this however was not made in the eighties if this film had come out in the early eighties the fax could be forgiven for looking so bad it wasn't so it hasn't got that defence the dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines i was wincing at the writing rather than squirming at torture i don't like hostel never have i thought it was over rated over hyped and i felt nothing for the protagonists however it shines as a beacon to greatness next to this garbage the back of the cover for live feed promised a twist you would never see coming i'm still waiting for the twist that was promised,0
this documentary or i should say mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it however something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a 1 of 10 and not a 0 an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to chemystry the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing so it is impossible anyway there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this element is more difficult to find than gold and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that it is ridiculous they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they got extincted probably cryptologist's call themselves scientists but they are not people like them say lies like in this mockumentary and what is worst some people buy them but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste their time,0
what the hell of a d movie was that bad acting bad special effects and the worst dialogues storyline i ever came across the only cool thing here was coolio who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop however the rest of the film is awful and boring it's not even so bad you can laugh about it just plain crap and whoever compares this to the evil dead series might as well compare tomb raider to indiana jones well ok at least there was angelina jolie in tomb raider 1 out of 10,0
anyone who has read my review for uwe boll's alone in the dark will remember that i compared the unenviable task of sitting through that piece of human waste to having each and every hair on your arm pulled out well take that analogy a step further with this irredeemable gutter trash and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth extracted without novacaine do that and you'll have a general idea of what eli roth's cabin fever is all about br br i never believed any one film was capable of topping the sheer agonizing dreck that uwe boll cranks out as the worst film ever made but in all honesty i have to say cabin fever comes very close this is yet another sad excuse for a motion picture that had absolutely no valid reason to meet with any form of theatrical release for somebody who claims to love the horror genre as much as eli roth does he has created the single most annoying and convoluted patchwork of a movie i think i have ever seen in my entire life how do you screw up a story like this think of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written characters without the bad writing and without all that unnecessary and unfunny comedy a movie dealing with a grotesque flesh eating virus could and should have been so much better than what roth dished out for us here this script failed on so many levels with me and while i do not doubt the evident talent this director possesses i do know that he fumbled the ball big time on an idea that could very well have redefined the horror genre br br to say this was a production of missed opportunities would indeed be a gross play on words a generous amount of blood and unsettling special effects can't even save it and that is one element i normally go for there really was nothing about cabin fever that i could easily recommend to anybody when three quarters of the crowd walks out of the theater halfway through you know the movie is sinking fast my best advice to those reading this would be to simply rent before purchasing one viewing was more than enough for me to know that i will most likely never bother with it again,0
i saw this movie on tv when it came out and never seen it again for the life of me i couldn't remember the title and just stumbled across it while checking roy thinne's movie credits excellent dark and spooky tv horror movie in the same class as crowhaven farm don't be afraid of the dark and satan's school for girls all lost satanic classics i also think it has many parallels to clint eastwood's classic high plains drifter why don't they release these great little movies especially when you consider all of the more recent garbage that fills the discount dvd racks at wal mart most of these flicks have a cult following so sales shouldn't be a problem,1

as many people know mexican cinema was very poor after the so called golden age of the mexican cinema fortunately during the late 90's and early 21st century great movies like la ley de herodes bajo california amores perros y tu mamá también and of course el coronel no tiene quien le escriba appeared el coronel is a wonderful movie that retells the classic story by gabriel garcía márquez by eliminating the magic realism elements and replacing them with the crude reality lived in mexico not only by people like the colonel who wait for their pensions but by more than the half of the mexican population who live in complete poverty the film's characters satirically represent classic characters found in mexican society such as the nationalist colonel the cold and even ambitious priest the hypocrite but at the same time loyal compadre the tolerant and patient wife the hidden homosexual etc this movie is a must see if you want to know more about mexican society and specially if you want to watch a gorgeous movie by one of mexico's finest directors,1
this interesting giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways br br directed by emilio p miraglia who one year earlier also made the very interesting la notte che evelyn usci della tomba see also my comment on that one the film starts off a little slow but all in all no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences br br this film is a german italian coproduction but it was released in germany on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title horror house at least the murder scenes which will satisfy every gorehound are fully intact and the viewer still gets the killer's motive at the end but the italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for of course br br a convincing giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings la dama rossa uccide sette volte is highly recommended to giallo fans and slightly superior to miraglia's above mentioned other thriller,1
this movie is another on the list that i did not want to see i was talked into it and dragged into the theater but boy am i glad for that i thought it was going to be just another love story but it turns out to be sooo much more than that definatly an intellectual flick one of those movies you have to pay attention to,1
very slow paced but intricately structured and ultimately very touching a nice very true to life look at a small florida beach town in the dead of winter i've been there and this is absolutely accurate br br it's also the debut feature of actress ashley judd and she makes a big impression here it's hard to believe this film is 12 years old i remember seeing it in theaters and i recently rented ruby again except for the 80's looking clothes it has held up very nicely ashely is so radiant and touching here that it's hard to think of her subsequent career without wincing boy talk about failing to fulfill your early promise anyone seeing ashley here in ruby in paradise would assume this elegant natural beauty went on to all kinds of interesting art films and serious acting instead she has become the go to girl for dumb action films and slasher movies very disappointing but at least we have this lovely performance preserved to showcase her early promise br br as some other commenter's say this is not for everyone as it's very slow paced this is not an action film nor is it really a romance the director victor nunez ulees gold another excellent character study treats this ordinary young woman's life with deep respect allowing her story to build slowly and with a lot of detail in that way i think this is one of the most moving and respectful coming of age stories about young women that i can recall it's not about ruby's sexual awakening or how she lost her virginity but about her life choices and her growing maturity br br a lovely film if you take the time to watch it i think it would be a really excellent film to show teens and young girls or boys for that matter and give them a chance to think about and discuss it br br particular kudos to director nunez who also wrote the script which is so realistic and nicely detailed that i assumed all through the movie that it was based on a female written novel or memoir but in fact it's mr nunez's original work rated 8 out of 10,1
my roommates i nearly shorted out our tv from the numerous spit takes we did while watching this hilarious piece of 1970s self important pseudo zen dreck i'd read about this campfest for ages and scanned my local late night tv listings for years in search of this elusive turd several years ago our local abc affiliate was known for showing cool flicks for its late night weekend flick ie frogs night of the lepus etc then one day it happened at 1 40am on a saturday night over 5 years ago there it was we had over 15 folks over and the flick did not disappoint br br see andy griffith as the silliest most unthreatening bad guy since jaye davidson in stargate br br see william shatner sport a variety of things atop his head that only faintly resemble human hair or anything organic for that matter br br hear jaw droppingly inane 1970s psychobabble that makes chicken soup for the soul sound like bf skinner br br feel content that any decade was better than the 70s br br for those still reading the plot surrounds a bunch of middle class mid level a holes who decide to suck up to their s head boss griffith by joining him on a cross dessert race that spans california mexico they all wear leather jackets looking more christopher street than anything else along the way they stop at a cantina get drunk smoke joints the sight robert mike brady reed smoke a joint is an image you won't soon forget start a fight attempt rape and just act like a bunch of suburban middle class jack offs although i have an excellent copy that i taped off tv i wish this one would be released on video so the whole world could enjoy its half baked goofiness,0
one thing that astonished me about this film and not in a good way was that nathan stoltzfus who seems to pride himself on being the major historian on the topic of the rosenstrasse was one of the historians working on this film considering how much of the actual events were altered or disregarded br br another reviewer said that von trotta said she never meant for lena to bed goebbels but in that case why did she give every impression that that was what had happened why not show other possible reasons for the mens' release such as the disaster that was stalingrad or the nazis' fear that the international press based in berlin would find out about the protest br br also why did the whole storyline play second fiddle to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again surely something as awesome as this could carry its own history in places it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have little in common br br overall this film failed in its aim which was to draw attention to a little known act of resistance which is a shame because done better it could have had a major impact,0
because some people like me like to know everything about a movie even if they plan to see it including the ending anyway here's the ending as i remember it because i couldn't have been more than 8 yrs old when i saw it for the first and only time on tv but i'll tell ya it sure scared the little kid that i was and i thought about it for days afterward and it still stands out in my mind to this day even though some of the details are a little vague abe vigoda was in this movie i don't remember that i didn't even remember that ol' barnabus was in this movie and i loved dark shadows so at the end the lead character belinda montgomery is lured by the judge joseph cotton i'm guessing even though i remember it as him being an old family physician or something instead of a judge see how memory fades to the wedding place which as i remember it is in a cavern of some kind maybe i've got that wrong and shelley winters is there laughing and the judge has a cape on and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him and he throws back the cloak and he has goat legs and he announces he's actually her father the devil and she's played right into their the satanic cult's hands because the mortal guy she has fallen in love with i guess that's robert foxworth turns out also to be the guy satan wants to marry her off to the demon with yellow eyes and yep sure enough they show robert foxworth and his eyes glow yellow there are a lot of close ups in the last few minutes of the film everyone is laughing and rejoicing except for belinda montgomery who is very unhappy and cries or screams or something and that's the end the bad guys win,0
as a collector of movie memorabilia i had to buy the movie poster for this film which now that i've finally seen it has to be the best thing about it there's nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melting man however there's nothing more awful to put in your vcr than an hour and a half long image of the melting man at first i thought this movie was pure garbage but then i realized that it did have some qualities which made me laugh the character of dr ted nelson has to be the most wishy washy persona ever brought to the big screen his dialogue is so trite it's unbelievable it's incredible he seems to be getting stronger as he melts br br and could somebody tell me please how the heck they know exactly how much time steve has left before he melts completely and exactly what their plan is to help him if this movie was meant to scare its audience i think it missed its calling,1
if the scale went negative i would be happier seeing sushmita sen was nice and nisha kothari has a bright future but the producer and the director ruined any and all enjoyment in this story the choice of angles choice of lighting and well everything distracted from trying to remember what is the story oh if the songs and dances haven't caused you to rip your ears off your head first the film could have been made twice at 1 25 hours and been pretty good kinda like seven samurai but the director and writer didn't go that direction even if the townsfolk finally find their backbone and want to help this movie fails on so many levels editing writing photography angles style lighting script name any aspect of this film it was bad probably the food from the caterer was bad too i have never in 6 years of watching indian bollywood movies seen something this badly made,0
the main reason i wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast a ton of my favorite actors in one movie equals amazing with out actually seeing it but this movie caught me off guard it wasn't what i was expecting at all it's been a while since i've seen it but i do remember i could not stop laughing and it wasn't just the cast that did it for me the script was amazingly written every time you were expecting something to happen it didn't happen there were so many twists and turns but it fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming off as pretentious the cinematography along with the set was absolutely beautiful as well i really can't say anything bad about this movie expcept i would have andrew davoli a little more screen time,1
below average movie with poor music considering a movie based on music ordinary script direction with full of blunders salman khan was at his usual acting ajay's performance deteriorating with time as his looks especially his styles as a rock star were pathetic asin was just a showpiece only overall i felt like wasting my money in cinema salman khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to aamir khan there were many songs in the movie all boring except man ko ati the most important song to impress the uk music sponsor was most unimpressive khanabadosh can be very easily understood by an english music sponsor the other movie i saw last week was wake up sid which was simple slow love story with good direction acting despite average music,0
this series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists it brings the book to life and makes even more sense of the author's subsequent opus collapse br br diamond himself comes off as personable and caring not just a disinterested or disengaged academic this series makes it clear that his book was not just a response to a need to publish or perish as the saying goes about academe but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone he respects why you white people got so much cargo and we have so little because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community diamond looked for an answer that didn't insult that intelligence or that community i like to think of his answer in a very simple way in the same spirit as south park's blame canada blame wheat,1
i finally got to have a look at this experimental lynch short after waiting for so long and unfortunately it wasn't worth it even for a die hard lynch fan i found this to be really tedious br br nothing happens there are long long long painful pauses where nothing happens long monotonous speeches where nothing is said and the whole thing finishes with the viewer not knowing or caring what the hell it was all about what happened before and what happened afterward br br there was a mulholland drive allusion the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very diane and rita esque and a lost highway moment with allusions to some significant event that happened but cannot be talked about clearly br br unfortunately it's all very uninteresting and very dull nothing happens it's very forgettable and i think i will delete it from my computer and forget i ever watched it sorry david,0
i saw this movie at an advance screening and found it excellent br br new york i love you is a true spin on a romance that explores clever funny and sometimes shocking situations around the human race's most powerful emotion br br the cast is huge a veritable oceans 11 with andy garcia ethan hawke shia labouf natalie portman bradley cooper and others they all give stand out performances in one way or another br br that's not to mention that there is a who's who of directors interweaving stories in clever and interesting ways brett rattner shaka kapur natalie portman i mean wow this movie is not a straight ahead romance or romantic comedy even though it is both romantic and funny it also has serious stories and notes but that's good in my opinion go see it for yourself and reply to my review i want to hear what others have to say,1
kalifornia is disturbing i believe there is no reason for this story to be told it is neither entertaining nor does it have social value technically the movie is very well make the performances are top rate and first class the story develops in an intriguing way that holds interest but at the end this movie sickens and is abhorrent to decency i recommend kalifornia to no one,0
i was particularly moved by the understated courage and integrity of l'anglaise in this beautifully acted intellectually and visually compelling film thank you so much monsieur le directeur rohmer,1
this movie is a lot of fun the actors really make the movie go the distance though without giving away the plot i would describe it as a new princess bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time you get to see a whole different side to robert deniro in this movie worth the price of admission just for that all the elements are there from adventure to romance and well placed comedy br br people of all ages will enjoy it my parents even did good special effects may be scary for the little ones good date movie great for some escapism br br deserves an a hope it does well at the box office,1
ghost train is a fine and entertaining film typical of the better british comedy chillers of the 1930s and 40s the antics of comedian arthur askey are not as funny as they once apparently were but this can be overcome by viewing him as a period piece or a curiosity br br for a low budget wartime production ghost train is atmospheric effective and it provides some genuine suspense great fun for a dark and yes stormy night lighten up take off the critic's hat and enjoy,1
yes i was lucky enough to see the long running original production of michael bennett's hit musical it was an amazing experience and i paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in 1985 it is awful almost everything fails first off attenborough a fine actor a good director with the right material is a sorry choice almost as bad as when john huston was hired to mangle annie the camera is always in the wrong place they chop up the songs and the casting they are awful the power of the play was these dancers these hungry talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance you couldn't take your eyes off of them but this cast just gets by dancing does a nice job singing but none of them spark one bit in fact look up the cast on imdb none of them really went on to do anything much ok ok janet jones married gretzky sheesh so this cinema trainwreck does not capture for one second the magic the desperation the passion of the stage musical a total strike out but even though they try to smother the music the great music still rises up at times and reminds people how great the score was,0
2002's undeservedly popular i love the 80's is an inane idiotic offensive and downright disgusting pop culture mess of a show that was the first in a long line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of vh1 which was at one time the only real music oriented channel left on tv i used to practically live on vh1 up until the spring or winter i forget which one now of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever out of sheer morbid curiosity i'd guess that's what you'd call it i had decided that i would go ahead and give it a look see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap at least i can honestly say that i wasn't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement level to begin with the emphasis of this show i found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't culturally significant or popular which is what i was expecting to see but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god awful no name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills rolls eyes more like lack thereof if you ask me it's pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so called humor that i swear i could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one liner they shot off one after another altogether i have no problem in saying that i love the 80's was is trash of the lowest denominator and one of the main reasons why i almost never watch vh1 anymore,0
this one is quite a nice surprise cute little story of the heroine's quest very surprising metamorphosis of the four eye prissy soon to be spinster type into a raunchy dd cup sex queen br br visually a sight for sore eyes not only for two quite stunning actresses but also for most of the costumes and make up of the actors an unnecessary bit of cheapness came in some ridiculous castle imitation br br back to the positives the movie is spiced with some unusually explicit camera shots which you would not expect in a soft core loved that scene with the icicles absolute classics potential a slight minus only for very few odd scenes where bad acting by minor casts shortly suspended the suspension of disbelief br br 9 10 including an extra credit for the serious drooling effect,1
let me set the scene it is the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing at the movies i am with my friend deciding what to see we look for a movie that is starting soon and the grinch comes up we buy tickets not knowing what to expect what we got was a roller coaster of fun br br jim carrey who may i add is my no 1 actor in the whole world was absolutely magnificent as the grinch in this ron howard's best movie next to apollo 13 the way that this movie was made the scenery the actors the props and the music was just amazing it really brought this childhood movie to life br br the story is based upon the story of the grinch as we all know the grinch is a horrible person who just can't stand christmas he lives high above whoville and has never mingled well with the townfolk but one little girl is going to change the grinch's look on life and on others in a drastic way br br cindy lou who played by adorable new actress taylor momsem meets the grinch as finds the kind part of him straight away she attempts to break the barrier and to help the grinch move in and mingle with the towns people br br all up this movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family both kids and parents a solid 10 10 well done jim br br,1
no real plot to this one just a series of short skits acting out some very old jokes i chuckled once or twice in the beginning much to my chagrin but even at only 73 minutes this film wears out it's welcome before too long and becomes stale and tedious with some nudity sprinkled in here and there to keep you awake still as bad as this movie is and that's pretty putrid it's a comedic gem compared to pretty much anything by aaron seltzer jason friedberg date movie epic movie meet the spartans also the song is sadly kind of catchy in a sad way br br eye candy 11 pair of tits 3 bushes 3 asses br br my grade d br br code red dvd extras original trailer for this film and trailers for beyond the door dead pit the farmer obsessed ones power play sole survivor wacky taxi,0
i'm not saying that because the production values were so low but because it was filmed terribly that shot of the girl washing her hair in the creek did we really need to sit there for an overlong shot and watch her do that for 5 minutes in the same spot it was terrible the lighting was just plain bad you could barely see anything and when the characters were talking you could barely hear what they were saying did i watch the whole movie of course not i skipped through most of it and i don't want to hear anyone say i need to watch the whole thing first to judge it this film was so poorly done and executed that even by independent and low budget standards it's just plain terrible awful movie don't waste any time on it unless you want a good laugh but even then it's not because of the actors funny lines it's because of how painstakingly bad the production is,0
this movie has a great message a impressive cast ellen burstyn samantha mathis jodelle ferland was 4 years old when she made this movie ellen burstyn and jodelle ferland have both been nominated for best actress in a tv drama at the up coming emmy awards in new york peter masterson director has been nominated best director tv drama at the emmy awards also april 1 2001 jodelle ferland 'won' best actress in a tv drama at the young artist awards in studio city ca i can see why they have 3 nominations mermaid is a true story during the cridits they have the real family on the set something you don't see often you can find mermaid at all blockbuster video stores do watch it you'll be glad you did,1
true fans of film will love this authentic movie br br i disagree with the trolls who are rating this movie a one star and calling it unrealistic while i don't have the background or come from the environment of the protagonists i've spent many years working in lower income and working class neighborhoods and feel the acting was very real and representative of how teenagers behave i don't know what the basis is for others' comments that the film is unrealistic the dialog is great br br the low budget production value didn't bother me a bit i felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film the focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not glitzy hollywood propping or melodrama br br i completely bought into the character's motivations and reactions the acting was believable and impressive for new and non actors br br if your idea of good film is transformers or fast furious then skip it if you enjoy good character driven dramas then see it br br regarding the negative commenters being trolls click on their names and you will see most have no other reviews or only negative reviews,1
i was pretty young when this came out in the us but i recorded it from tv and watched it over and over again until i had the whole thing memorized to this day i still catch myself quoting it the show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters from frank sinatra to sylvester stallone to mr t the voices were great and sounded just like the characters they were portraying the puppets were also well done although a little creepy i was surprised to find out just recently that it was written by rob grant and doug naylor of red dwarf a show that i also enjoy very much like another person had written in a comment earlier i too was robbed of this great show by a friend who borrowed it and never returned it i sure wish there was enough demand for this show to warrant a dvd release but i don't think enough people have heard of it oh well maybe i'll try e bay,1
unless you are geeky film student who has to see everything this film will not only be a waste of your time and money and a huge disappointment but it will also make you angry beyond belief br br there might be a story worth telling somewhere inside but hopkins decided to hide it and encode under so many incessant chaotic layers of apparently random audio video microcuts making the viewer's patience run thin after a very short while br br why would someone like hopkins choose such a heavy most difficult and highly unstable project as his first script first score and third film can by anyones guess maybe he played with it in his mind for such a long time until it became unrecognizable as what it became not even for himself the result proves that he has by far not enough experience or skill to achieve the desired result br br even the weirdest carpenter and lynch films to name just two uncoventional filmmakers had 90 more coherence 95 less characters and 99 more story flow br br sir anthony you aimed for the stars but unfortunately missed by a couple of light years please stick to acting in that department you are a unequaled giant and nobody should ask more from you not even yourself,0
if you merely look at the cover of this movie it's cool don't the movie itself put me to sleep it was slow paced had minimal violence and a poor use of suspense the acting was bottom feeder material and the plot while it would've been cool for a different movie was poorly shown here they even kill the only likeable character in the whole film i give it a 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was the plot twist at the end other than that you might want to save yourself from this movie trash,0
red eye is a thrilling film by the creator of freddy kreuger wes craven wes craven depicts the story of a regular hotel worker lisa after attending the funeral of her grandmother she decides to take the red eye flight during waiting she meets this man named jack rippner how fffrreeaakkyy is that and they sort of become friends ironically both sit right next to each other on this plane then this is when the horror starts this movie is thrilling and to the weak hearted people who don't like thrilling horror films well lets say that its possible that they might pee in their pants this is an excellent example of a bone shaking production wes craven did well with this film he chose the right actors like rachel mcadams an intelligent sexy girl who knows what she's doing and is cautious of everything when she's acting in a film cillian murphy the scary and horrifying actor who can chill your bones at his amazing acting being the bad character in this film and his face can really widen your eyes wes craven did an excellent job and i hope that he makes more films like this one,1
make no mistake maureen o'sullivan is easily the most gorgeous jane ever and there will never be one more gorgeous she is visually stunning that aside it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film this is a great film it not only has the classic tarzan aura but also the feel of the continuing saga we become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory one of them in love with jane the other a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history and these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic there is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted however the africans are depicted as individuals and at the end two even become more heroic than the white hunters and stand out as such in fact the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters the finale also is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie the great lion attack has never been duplicated and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction if i left anything out it is because i do not want to soil the picture for those who haven't seen it but it is everything you could want in a movie,1
forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films its influence was felt for more than a decade however certain elements relating to how this wide screen entertainment was aimed at a mid fifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit and the film's sometimes sluggish pacing doesn't help but the story's compelling central idea involving the ancient extinct krell civilization and monsters from the id hasn't lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant must see movie what i'm mostly interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible the movie has never really looked that good on home video and it's elements are in dire need of restoration i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic,1
if you enjoy films like american pie road trip van wilder avoid this cinematic refuse at all costs it is an unamusing mean spirited insipid waste of resources that should never have been discussed aloud much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers easily the worst film i have seen in the past 18 months mind numbingly bad for the entire 86 minutes of it's runtime had it been much longer i would not have been able to write this review without using profanity consider yourself warned,0

usually i know after the first minute of a movie if i will hate it or adore it but now i was wrong br br the start was great the this is based on a true story and blah blah blah thing was funny after the cartoons and the description of the guys' life with pictures made me think i had made the right choice br br then seeing the hilarious fake look of toronto was cool also the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea br br that was maybe the first 10 minutes of the movie which afterwards looked like an eternity br br maybe that's just me not understanding english canadian humour that's possible english canadians also do not always understand quebecois humour but hey there was enough stuff in that for a short movie nothing more maybe that could be a meaning for the title anyway almost everything was filling and very few things were even close to funny in my opinion br br as a matter of fact the making of was better than the movie at least you understand the motivation behind that which made everything bad the potential of the idea was great that's why i rented the movie being interested in the annoying people disappearance thing but yet i did not know the whole universe would vanish and with it even a point to the movie br br if you are english canadian it seems you could appreciate the local humour considering the surprising number of people who gave this movie an 8 otherwise just think twice before losing your precious time,0
pickup on south street 1953 directed by movie maverick samuel fuller contains a stunning opening that establishes a double complication subway rider candy susan peters collides with pickpocket skip mccoy richard widmark dipped in shades of sinatra cool she's unaware that she carries valuable microfilm mccoy is unaware of grifting it both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents thus the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges candy is doubly watched skip and the police and therefore doubly naive skip the overconfident petty thief is singularly unaware trailed by federal agents the feds all knowing are ultimately helpless they can't stop the passing of government secrets or the spread of communism,1
evidently when you offer a actor enough money they will do anything i am not sure how much john rys daves got but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a rotten movie the special effects were worse then effects from the 1950's b movies and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse as to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion the english was terribly accented and i think no one could really even speak english they just memorized how the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character both life like and real,0
this movie is a bad attempt to make original fans feel complete the one thing people have forgotten is the fact that the reason the original won such acclaim was strictly do to the fact that it was supposed to make you feel incomplete br br this movie makes me want to go to the washroom i am not a negative type of guy but man the acting in this flick is no comment the plot was a bad reflection of the life of carlito brigante and i am sorry to have had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this flick i still love the original and will do my best not to let this movie ruin my opinion about it,0
this long winded film turns out to be less about berkowitz and his effect on nyc but more about painting caricatures of a certain group of italian americans known locally as guidos the problem is that guidos are uninteresting no matter what kind of story or setting they are immersed in they are already living caricatures so lee only amplifies them rather than simply portraying them br br when someone has a caricature done of themselves they don't go home and say hey let's make the ears and nose even bigger that's what lee has done in this film the most interesting characters in the film are the two adrian brody and jennifer esposito who wish to escape the guido lifestyle top it off with an uninteresting storyline for the characters particularly john leguizamo's and you get a nice film to fall asleep by especially considering it's lengthy run time br br one more strike against it for someone proclaiming to be a yankees fan and has grown up in new york spike lee should know how to spell phil rizzuto which is spelled incorrectly in the closing credits,0
one of those thank god i don't live there documentaries this one tells of two warring factions in colombia guerrillas and paramilitaries and the surrounding peoples of medellin br br guns drugs and death run rampant the guys no older than 22 not in the middle of fighting a war are in jail the girls  not women girls  always react the same way when one of them is killed with tears and screaming you scratch your head what did they expect really i don't know what's more disturbing the nightly shoot outs and civil unrest or that everybody just seems to passively accept things as are or seeing that boy drinking what is obviously not his first beer being all of what 10 if you were to take these any of these young men out of their situation and put them some place where they had the opportunity to do more be more how many would choose not to stay br br based on this documentary all i'm afraid,0
fully deserving its prestigious hollywood award nomination this is an entertaining little gem with lots of pizazz and some delightful surprises outstandingly funny scenes include an hilarious shoot and re shoot of a ww1 trench scene with australian comedian clyde cook as an optimistic non com and the hapless mcdoakes as a boyer colman messenger  all under the beady eye of ralph sanford's delightfully irascible anguish a lost mcdoakes guided and re guided by equally perplexed jack carson assistant director chandler rejoicing in a mcdoakes sent opportunity i'm going to be a director br br ace comic o'hanlon has a dual role playing both mcdoakes and himself playing mcdoakes oddly richard l bare who does play himself in one or more other entries in the series has turned down that opportunity here in real life bare's a youngish six foot rock hudson lookalike but here he's impersonated by veteran actor over 500 movies jack mower,1
this is the sorriest collection of clichés strung together on a straight line with no discernible plot or any decent way of acting i've seen in a long time canibalising scenes from star wars reign of fire godzilla lord of the rings and harry potter it went for an all out war on the viewer intelligence was this movie good it wasn't a movie at all br br even if it doesn't go so low to actually be funny and achieve cult status as a comedy the movie does offer some laughs the trick is to put the copied scenes in the context of their original films gandalf can be funny talking korean the basilisk looking snake hilarious if you compare it to a kitten and the evil henchman can provide a lot of fun switching back and forth between sauron and jaja bing or whatever his name was br br bottom line any pleasure derived from this movie is completely dependent on the state of intoxication and imagination of the viewers not on the director writer shame on you shim,0
i couldn't wait to see this movie about half way through the movie i couldn't wait for it to end all of the white actors were delivering their lines like woody allen had just said say it like this then they said their lines on screen like they were trying to imitate woody allen it was so annoying we all know how will ferrell really talks and he doesn't stumble over his words like mr allen the comedy portion of this film was just as boring as the tragedy and definitely never funny or even entertaining i must admit that i have never been a major woody allen fan and this movie definitely has not converted me i think that his writing was just as bad as his direction this movie will go down as one of the worst 10 movies i have ever seen,0
although dig was being hailed as being closest to what the music industry is like it is highly fabricated the director has misled the audience into believing the brian jonestown massacre disappeared off the face of the earth post '98 and the rivalry between the dandy warhols and jonestown has been milked the truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film br br that said this film is endlessly quotable and is an interesting watch as we get a look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art one of the best things this film has going for it is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene br br recommended mostly for the music and the two fantastic bands,1
unfortunately because of us viewers' tendency to shun subtitles this movie has not received the distribution nor attention it merits its subtle themes of belonging identity racial relations and especially how colonialism harms all parties transcend the obvious dramatic tensions the nostalgic memories of the protaganiste's childhood and the exoticism of her relationship with her parents' houseboy perhaps the only real human she knows we won't even look at her mother's relationship with this elegant man there i hope i've given you enough of a hook to take it in whether you speak french or like subtitles or not i challenge you to be as brave strong and aware as la p'tite,1
this movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together well there's nothing wrong with that except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together 90 percent of the cast are white males about same age it's almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves the movie has no plot it simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath there are some funny scenes and comedic bits but they don't redeem the flat monotony br br the graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do and not done very well at that anything that can't be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation br br i went to see this film after seeing the trailer which makes it look like a tarrentino piece well the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane inane comedy it works at times but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over it's more like a string of satuday night live skits than a movie it's a hit you over the head with it kind of comedy i can see where the story idea is intriguing but in this film post apocalyptic america is much like medevil england in fact wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era he plans to make a part 2 i guess he thinks he's tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing br br at the opening in la wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2 he was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one to which he replied well yea sure,0
its too bad that no one knows anything about this movie and it gets old telling people it's rap's version of spinal tap and you know im sorry i dont have any better comments but damnit go get the movie and watch it and then make all your friends watch it too just like im gonna,1
i guess i'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film is it one of the best of the nightmare series maybe not but i had lots of fun with it freddy krueger reaches his evil wisecracking potential since parts 4 and 5 kind of lagged the series down i felt this so called final installment new nightmare is the real finale brought the series out of its slump there are some great nightmare sequences including one where breckin meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game to which freddy controls this is both a highly original and hilarious sequence especially when we see him out of the dreamscape hopping around like super mario and freddy belts out the funny one liner great graphics and since the movie was made about 10 years ago it brought back memories when freddy started controlling the game with the powerglove anyone who remembers the first 8 bit nintendo remembers the powerglove br br the cast is superb lisa zane is perfectly cast in the lead i haven't seen yaphet kotto since the running man and i think the last time i saw that film was about 5 years ago he's another great underappreciated actor who possesses a powerful screen presence and who can forget the cameos the best one is by johnny depp from the first nightmare playing a spokesman for an anti drug commercial br br the 3d sequence at the end is really awesome so for those who are looking to check this film out please rent or buy it on dvd hopefully all the editions come with the 3d glasses but i'm sure the video edition has the 3d element removed br br i personally didn't see many things wrong with the film it even elaborated on freddy's backstory the film is a great mix of humor and scares and the gross out effects are terrific could this have given better justice to the franchise of course it could have but rachel talalay did a fine job and finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done br br and in closing i loved the montage over the opening credits fans of the series will be delighted and will look at it as a tribute to beloved freddy br br my score 7 out of 10,1
not the worst movie i've seen but definitely not very good either i myself am a paintball player used to play airball a lot and going from woods to airball is quite a large change the movie portrays similar qualitys first of all the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this phantom guy or whatever they appear to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot mags autocockers one guy sporting a bushy not much wrong with the movie but more how it's perceived it was very cheesy a bunch of kids who are the good guys are woodsball players who don't appear to have much money and have dreams of getting better guns another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they play woods and blah blah blah the phantom helps these woodsball kids out and trains them and all this crap he gets them to play airball and basically defeats all the teams including the professionals br br so what exactly is wrong with the movie well the budget is a huge thing a paintball movie wouldn't be bad but the budget is pretty low and the movie feels like it was done by an amateur there are no big names in this film and the acting is very cheesy the perception of paintball is pretty bad too they seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this other crap it just was a lousy movie in my opinion and doesn't give a real perception what paintball is to be honest real paintball isn't all buddy like it's a lot of cussing and bonus balling not respect and playing by the rules don't watch this movie and then expect to go to a field screaming 4 is 1,0
on the back burner for years so it was reported this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly and went straight downhill from there mary richards mary tyler moore and her best friend rhoda morgenstern valerie harper meet in new york after a long estrangement and catch up on each other's lives what a novel concept but sad to relate nothing worth talking about let alone making a movie about has happened to either of them in the intervening years so instead the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another most having to do with older women in the workplace while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner the supporting cast is instantly forgettable the humor is nonexistent and the chemistry which moore and harper once had together is gone moore allegedly stalled this project for years waiting for just the right script before committing herself if this was the one she considered right what on earth were the ones she turned down like it's not the age of the characters that does this in for time inevitably marches on but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work at one time this was intended as a pilot but all to obviously it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors or for that matter among potential audiences quickly and mercifully forgotten the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic,0
what a horrible comedy totally lame the supposed humor was simple and stupid stanly tucci a great actor had the only parts worth chuckling at and he was tied up and gagged at the time don't waste your time with this one it deserves a 0 10,0
clint eastwood reprises his role as dirty harry who this time is on the case of a vigilante sondra locke who is killing the people that raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago eastwood makes the role his and the movie is mainly more action then talk not that i'm complaining sudden impact is indeed enjoyable entertainment,1
review may contain spoilers br br predictable campy bad special effects it has a tv movie feeling to it the idea of the un as being taken over by satan is an interesting twist to the end of the world according to the bible the premise is interesting but its excution falls waaaay short if you want to convert people to christianity with a film like this at least make it a quality one i was seriously checking my watch while watching this piece of dreck can't say much else about this film since i saw it over a year ago and there isn't really much to say about this film other than skip it,0
this film is predictable it is more predictable then a vinnie testaverdi pass when he huts the ball for the jets one saw the ending coming up halfway through the film the politics reminds me when i was back east many people know when the fix is in i gave this four because of the acting but the story is lame,0
paulie is a fantasy of a littler girl or perhaps her recollection of what her youth was like growing up br br tony shaloub executes a flawless performance as an russian scientist phd who cannot find decent work in america he befriends an isolated parrot while performing meanial duties of a janitor at a behavioral science lab br br the chief doctor is a bitter man as paulie who can speak and fully comprehend language and learn embarasses the doctor who later banishses him to the lower levels of the building where mikail tony s finds him br br paulie recants his life with marie and how they lost each other the quest begins to reunite paulie with marie only more than 20 years has passed br br the movie ends some will say predictably with mikail reuniting paulie with marie the story closes with the three entering marie's home where you can make the final your own choice br br great family film,1
the creativeness of this movie was lost from the beginning when the writers and directors left out a good story line only to substitute with horrible special affects this movie seemed to be focused on amusing children but couldn't even accomplish that many small low budget films have the potential to become great movies but this movie is no where near that fortunately this will be another film easily made and easily forgotten this movie was probably a chance for the actors to make a little money on the side until their chance came along for a real role in a good movie anyone who has a shred of respect for films should avoid seeing this movie at all costs,0
first off i have to say that i loved the book animal farm i read it with my 9th grade class and it was great we also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial the movie was so disappointing to me the movie cuts out some characters and misses a lot of the main points of the book it skips around a lot and doesn't explain anything in detail if someone was watching this movie without having first read the book they would be confused the most disappointing thing in this movie to me was the ending the ending in the book was the most powerful and in the movie they changed it it was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of melting together but instead the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs to sum up i don't think that this movie captured the real meaning that orwell portrayed in his book,0
