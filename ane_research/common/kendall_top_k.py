"""
Top-k kendall-tau correlation metric for full (no ties) or partial (with ties) ranked lists.
The value of k can be provided or, optionally, set to the minimum number of non-zero elements in either list.

Returns a scalar in the range [-1, 1] where 1 means both rankings are identical and -1 means the rankings
are opposites.
