## Setup

Prepare a Python virtual environment and install the necessary packages.

```shell
 python3 -m venv v-ane-research
 source v-ane-research/bin/activate
 pip install torch torchvision torchtext
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 python -m spacy download en
```

## Reproducing our Experiments

From the base directory:

### Option 1

Run all AllenNLP `Jsonnet` files in the `experiments` directory:

```sh
python run_experiment.py
```

### Option 2

Run a specific `Jsonnet` experiment

```sh
python run_experiment.py --experiment_path experiments/sst_tanh_sparsemax.jsonnet
```

### Option 3

Open the `replicate_paper.ipynb` iPython notebook with your preferred Jupyter server.

### Option 4

Instantiate a new `Experiment` class in your own Python file.

## Viewing the Results

Trained models and experiment results are located in the `outputs` directory, indexed by experiment file name and timestamp. You can view the correlation graphs as `.png`, `.svg`, or `.pdf` images in the `graphs` sub-folder. You can view the correlation statistics in the `correlation` sub-folder.

## Extending our Research

Since our code uses AllenNLP, you can easily add a new `Jsonnet` experiment file to the `experiments` directory.

## Linting
Simply run `python setup.py lint`
